City Attorney Palmer Davis told commissioners on Friday that Lakeland could receive about $1.1 million from DuPont and $13.5 million from 3M as part of a $13.6 billion settlement tentatively approved by the U.S. District Court in Charleston S.C.

The money would be set aside for future efforts to detect and remove chemicals known as PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances) from the city’s water supply — although actual remediation costs are likely to be far higher than the payout.

“The way the settlement agreements are structured you’re in the class unless you opt out” Davis explained. The deadlines to request exclusion are Dec. 4 for DuPont and Dec. 11 for 3M.

Davis said Lakeland’s share of the settlement is a “rough estimate” based on allocation tables that factor in the amount of contamination and volume of water. If Lakeland accepts the settlement it cannot sue again later based on new findings.

Several cities have criticized the settlement offer as inadequate and premature saying there’s not enough information about the scope of the problem or the potential costs of addressing it. At least a dozen have opted out to reserve the right to pursue their own claims later. They include: Fort Worth; Portland Ore.; Myrtle Beach Columbia and Lexington S.C.; LaGrange Ga.; Hastings Minn.

“If you opt out of the class you’d have to maintain your own litigation against 3M and DuPont so you’d be engaging in highly complex litigation against international companies” Davis told the commissioners.

The settlement agreement was reached just as the case was about to go to trial after a five-year legal battle that involved 7.4 million pages of discovery documents and 160 depositions.

“It makes a lot more sense to stay in than opt out so that’s my recommendation to you” Davis said. In addition to the expense of pursuing a case he said: “There’s definitely talk that both of these companies may file for bankruptcy. If you’re part of the class you’re a protected creditor. If you go it alone then you’re on your own and you may not get anything.”

An ‘urgent public health issue’

For many decades PFAS chemicals were used to make industrial and consumer products including firefighting foam nonstick cookware grease-resistant food packaging and stain- and water-repellant carpets upholstery and fabrics. This included products labeled Teflon and Scotchguard.

In the “PFAS Strategic Roadmap” for 2021-2024 EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan wrote: “As the science has continued to develop we know more now than ever about how PFAS build up in our bodies over long periods of time and how they can cause adverse health effects that can devastate families.”

Over time researchers have discovered several alarming things:

PFAS chemicals don’t break down in the environment or do so extremely slowly hence the nickname “forever chemicals.”

They’ve been found in air surface water groundwater soil fish and the blood of people and animals all over the world — including Antarctica and the Tibetan plateau.

Exposure has been linked with a variety of health risks including prostate kidney and testicular cancers; decreased fertility; immune disorders; developmental delays and hormone disruption in children; liver and thyroid problems; and increased cholesterol.

In 2016 the Environmental Protection Agency set a “health advisory” guideline for two of the chemicals: PFOA and PFOS. The levels were set at no more than 70 parts per trillion combined in drinking water.

Earlier this year the EPA dramatically lowered the acceptable levels setting the “lifetime health advisory level” for PFOA at .004 parts per trillion and PFOS at .02 parts per trillion. It also established levels for two other PFAS chemicals. Water utilities must report levels of 4 parts per trillion or more.

The EPA has also advised that national legally enforceable drinking water standards are coming with limits for six PFAS compounds and requirements to monitor 29 PFAS compounds.

The challenge for Lakeland

While PFAS have been found in Lakeland’s water the city is within the EPA’s recommended standards — for now Water Production Manager Joe Costine told commissioners Friday.

Lakeland currently gets its water from 19 wells drilled into the Floridan aquifer. The raw water is delivered to two treatment centers where it is softened with lime and disinfected with chlorine: the C. Wayne Combee Plant and the T. B. Williams Plant.

Costine said there are two generally accepted methods to remove PFAS from drinking water: granular activated carbon filtration or reverse osmosis. Lakeland is not presently using either process at its two treatment plants.

“They’re expensive to set up … but the biggest problem is not necessarily the cost of treatment; it’s actually the cost of disposal” Costine explained. “Because then you’ve concentrated a hazardous chemical.” He said the only current method of disposal is incineration at 4000 degrees Fahrenheit and “not just any incinerator can handle that.”

One Florida city that has started removing PFAS from its water is Stuart which is expecting to get more than $100 million from the class action settlement. In 2016 Stuart discovered that the levels in its water supply exceeded federal guidelines. It closed its 24 wells and built an $18.3 million reverse osmosis treatment facility. Costine said Stuart has been shipping the PFAS concentrates by barge across the Gulf of Mexico to an incinerator in Texas.

Testing methods are evolving but Costine said because the amounts are thousandths of parts per trillion it is difficult to know precisely how much PFAS is in the water. Also there are more than 14000 known PFAS compounds but current guidelines only address six.

He said Lakeland will likely have to invest in remediation in the future but abatement processes may also improve and become more accessible.

“Hopefully the regulations will not be too burdensome on us once they pass” Davis said.

Settlement won’t be enough but alternatives are grim

A fact sheet put together by attorneys who brokered the settlements noted that the 3M and DuPont settlements alone won’t be enough to clean up the nation’s water supply.

“The anticipated cost of PFAS drinking water clean-up exceeds the market cap of all potentially liable defendants” the fact sheet says. “It is estimated that it would cost approximately $100 billion or more to address the nation’s PFAS contamination. Finding funding sufficient to address a problem of this magnitude will require more than one funding source.”

The fact sheet says the class action settlements could be combined with other funding sources including about $9 billion earmarked by the federal government for PFAS cleanup.

If municipalities opt out of the settlement the attorneys caution “That will set them back years since they would need to relitigate the issues that the settlements would otherwise resolve and further there is no guaranteed outcome.”

“By contrast the settlements remove litigation risk and will provide funds starting in 2024 so (public water systems) can begin to fix their PFAS contamination problems quickly” it says.

Additionally if too many water systems “seek their own trials or a larger payday 3M and DuPont will have no choice but to exercise their right to terminate the settlements and might well seek bankruptcy protection. If that were to occur (municipalities) would be forced to wait years for the bankruptcy court to sort out all of the defendants’ creditors and water systems could end up with pennies on the dollar at best.”

Lakeland commissioners did not formalize their decision Friday because they cannot vote during agenda study sessions but most seemed to agree with Davis’ recommendation.

There is a City Commission meeting on Monday.

The discussion of the PFAS class action settlement begins at 1:24. | City of Lakeland",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90cmVuZGluZy1zdG9jay0zbS1jb21wYW55LW1tbS0xNDAwMDkyMjIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Trending Stock 3M Company (MMM) a Buy Now?,"3M (MMM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.

Over the past month shares of this maker of Post-it notes industrial coatings and ceramics have returned +7.3% compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +9.2% change. During this period the Zacks Diversified Operations industry which 3M falls in has gained 11.3%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Earnings Estimate Revisions

Rather than focusing on anything else we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter 3M is expected to post earnings of $2.32 per share indicating a change of +1.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

The consensus earnings estimate of $9.12 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -9.7%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.

For the next fiscal year the consensus earnings estimate of $9.92 indicates a change of +8.8% from what 3M is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month the estimate has changed +0.7%.

Having a strong externally audited track record our proprietary stock rating tool the Zacks Rank offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate along with three other factors related to earnings estimates 3M is rated Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Story continues

The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:

12 Month EPS

Revenue Growth Forecast

While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.

For 3M the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.68 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -5%. For the current and next fiscal years $31.76 billion and $32.39 billion estimates indicate -7.2% and +2% changes respectively.

Last Reported Results and Surprise History

3M reported revenues of $8.31 billion in the last reported quarter representing a year-over-year change of -3.6%. EPS of $2.68 for the same period compares with $2.69 a year ago.

Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.95 billion the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.52%. The EPS surprise was +14.53%.

Over the last four quarters 3M surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.

Valuation

No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.

Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF) to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued overvalued or undervalued whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.

As part of the Zacks Style Scores system the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on) making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued rightly valued or temporarily undervalued.

3M is graded A on this front indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.

Bottom Line

The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about 3M. However its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.

Everyone’s ears are different and you’ll need a good fit to get maximum sound blockage—especially if you’re a light sleeper looking to silence your partner’s thunderous snoring without reaching for those bulky noise-canceling headphones). But all pairs aren’t created equal some don't block out all the noise others don't fit well so that’s where we come in. Don’t worry you’ll be sleeping in a blissfully soft foam earplug in no time.

For the absolute best sound blockage our pick is the Hearos Xtreme. These adorably plump earplugs thoroughly seal off your ears from outside noises without exerting too much pressure on the sides of your ear canals. If you have smaller ears or find the Xtreme too intrusive the 3M’s E-A-Rsoft are almost as good at blocking sound and have a narrower fit. If you’d prefer a pair that’s a bit more versatile and eco-friendly we’d recommend the Happy Ears Listen. These reusable earplugs don’t block as much sound but they’ll keep things pleasantly muffled while also easily sliding into your bag.

To help you choose earplugs for sleeping or to fall asleep more easily here are the best earplugs available online right now

Credit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar The Hearos Xtreme were great at blocking sound in our testing.

Best Overall Hearos Xtreme Our top pick is the Hearos Xtreme for their superior sound blocking and comfort combination. They came in third in our lab sound-blocking tests and first in objective testing for sound blockage and comfort while being worn in various scenarios. They also placed second in a poll of Reviewed staffers for comfort and sound blocking and tied for second in the subjective testing for reuse storage and overall experience. They aren’t uncomfortable but you know they’re in—you just don’t necessarily care thanks to the blissful silence they provide. You can order a set of 100 pairs or just 14 pairs which is nice if you don’t plan on using them long-term. Pros Fantastic at blocking noise

Comfortable

Sold in smaller packs Cons None that we could find Buy now at Amazon

$9.99 from Walmart

Best For Small Ears 3M E-A-Rsoft The 3M E-A-Rsoft might be a better choice if you value comfort over sound blockage or just have fussier ear canals as they’re smaller than the Hearos. They came in second place on our sound isolation test but didn’t score quite as high on the in-ear sound blocking test partially due to how fiddly they can be to insert. Once you get a good fit though they excel. At one point during the testing process my partner and I were cleaning our apartment and had the dishwasher AC and vacuum running simultaneously and of all the pairs I had on hand this was the one I reached for when I decided the noise was too much. They’re only available in a set of 200 which is a bit irksome if you’re looking to purchase them for a short trip but each pair is individually wrapped so you can easily take what you need (though that can create a lot of plastic waste in the process). The box also has a small hole punched in it to demonstrate roughly what size to roll the plugs to for insertion which is a nice clever touch. Pros Great at blocking noise

Fit well in smaller ear canals Cons Tricky to insert

Sold only in 200-packs Buy now at Amazon

$28.99 from Walmart

Flents Quiet Time The Flents Quiet Time were so close to being great but somehow just couldn't cross that final hurdle. They’re a bit firmer than some of the other picks so they don’t roll up as easily making them trickier to insert. It also made it more obvious when they seemed to have softened up later. They felt like they lost firmness after being carried in a hot bag almost as though they had slightly melted. Something about these seemed to trigger my tinnitus as well something I noticed in a few of the lower-ranked pairs. They did tie for second place (along with the Hearos Xtreme) in the Reviewed office survey which suggests that you may agree that the potential upgrade in comfort is worth their inconveniences. Pros Blocks out noise well

Comfortable in the ear Cons Stiffer than other foam earplugs

Tough to get a solid seal Buy now at Amazon

$21.79 from Walmart

Mack's Slim Fit Soft Foam The Mack’s Slim Fit were also a very strong contender tying for the third-place slot with the Flents and mere fractions of points away from bumping out the 3Ms. These slide into small ear canals like a dream and provide consistently solid sound blockage scoring first place on our lab sound tests. Their sound testing in the objective tests however just wasn’t quite as good and they were middle of the pack in the office poll. I did make a small user error during their testing at one point and inserted them with slightly damp hands (you're supposed to make sure your hands are clean after all). My ear canals hated that so make sure your hands are dry before trying your insertion. They were still so comfortable that I almost didn't mind that their sound blockage didn't feel quite up to par with the others. If our top picks don’t work for you both these and the Flents would be a very good next choice to try. Pros Slide into ears easily

Block out noise well Cons None that we could find Buy now at Amazon

$14.99 from Walmart

Mack’s Snore Blockers For those with larger ears Mack's Snore Blockers are worth trying. With over one thousand global ratings on Amazon these earplugs are inexpensive and come in a pack of 12 so if you aren't a fan you won't have to worry about having a ton of extra earplugs going to waste. Reviews mention that these earplugs work well when it comes to blocking out light-to-moderate amounts of noise but if your partner is a super snorer then they might not be the best bet—but at this price point they're worth checking out. It's also important to note that for some these earplugs can be a bit big and stick out of your ears if yours are small. If that’s you then we recommend you skip and try the Slim Fit instead. Pros Inexpensive

Blocks moderate noise Cons Large size is uncomfortable for some Buy now at Amazon

Honeywell Howard Leight MAX-1 The Howard Leight Max1 is another set that did well. Their flared base feature is great for in-ear adjustments and judging the depth of insertion. They were more challenging to insert but some Reviewed staffers swear by them so they’re worth a shot if our other options aren’t a fit. Pros Flared bottom ensures better seal Cons Challenging to insert Buy now at Amazon

$28.99 from Walmart

Moldex 6800 Pura-Fit Moldex Pura-fit didn’t insert easily and they lost their shape by the morning. They rebounded eventually but we had concerns about their possible reusability and general comfort. They came in last place in our subjective testing and I could never forget I was wearing them while somehow still hearing most of what was around me. I consistently struggled to get a reasonable fit despite being able to hear them expanding in my ears a somewhat bizarre effect. Pros None that we could find Cons Don't fit well in ear canal

Noise still leaks in

Concerns over durability Buy now at Amazon

$42.95 from Walmart

Mack's Ultra Soft Foam Mack’s Ultra Softs is very plump for earplugs and they’re also an unpleasant beige color. If you have large ear canals and are drawn to the visual appeal of chunks of putty these may be for you. However they shouldn’t be your first try despite being awarded “Amazon’s Choice” if you just search the site for earplugs. Pros Offer a robust seal Cons Slightly large

Not attractive looking Buy now at Amazon

$14.99 from Walmart

Mack's Pillow Soft Silicone Mack’s Pillow Soft Silicone is a good option if you don’t want to actively insert anything into your ear canal. You just roll up the waxy material and then smooth it over your ear. It’s more comfortable for side sleepers. If it weren’t for the cave-like echo you could almost forget you’re wearing them. But these silicone earplugs don’t block as much sound and the sticky material can pick up hair and pillow fuzz. Pros Keeps material out of ear canals

Comfortable for side sleepers Cons Doesn't block out noise well

Get dirty really easily $24.98 from Walmart

Liberty Dura Plug Liberty Duraplugs were among the least comfortable options. My notes included the phrase “I hate these they’re just tiny foam how are they so uncomfortable” and it proved very challenging to get a good fit. They managed to somehow irritate my ear canals without actually staying in my ears. Pros None that we could find Cons Uncomfortable

Ill-fitting

Foam irritates ear canals Buy now at Amazon

$23.95 from Walmart

Honeywell Howard Leight Laser Lite LL-1 The low performance of the Howard Leight Laser Lites came as a genuine surprise given their popularity in other corners of the internet and generally strong brand following. I woke up at 6 a.m. to yank them out of my ears. They came in fourth in our lab noise reduction test and had the lowest score in the staff survey. Pros None that we could find Cons Uncomfortable

Don't block out noise well Buy now at Amazon

What You Need to Know About Earplugs

If you want proper sound blockage you need to make sure you’re inserting the earplug correctly (all of the packages have instructions on how to do so) and that it fits your ear shape. If you try multiple times and still can’t get a pair to work you may need to try a different size (some come in small medium and large options) or a different brand.

These earplugs were tested mainly for sleeping not for band practice or loud bars. There are other types of earplugs designed to better maintain acoustic integrity if that’s what you’re after. Though it can’t hurt to try these out about town if you’re routinely exposed to high decibel levels such as the ones you might find standing in a subway tunnel.

Credit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar According to a physician-reviewed article at Healthline wearing earplugs every night for a prolonged period of time might lead to a buildup of earwax getting pushed to the back of your ear leading to potential temporary hearing loss or tinnitus.

Regardless of how loud your noise situation is if you find yourself needing to wear earplugs every night you may just want to move instead. According to a physician-reviewed article at Healthline wearing earplugs every night for a prolonged period of time might lead to a buildup of earwax getting pushed to the back of your ear leading to potential temporary hearing loss or tinnitus. Bacteria can also build up on the earplugs potentially causing ear infections. To minimize your risk factors it’s suggested that you don’t use the same set for too long.

Nevertheless we are always paying attention to the latest value growth and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.

Of these perhaps no stock market trend is more popular than value investing which is a strategy that has proven to be successful in all sorts of market environments. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.

Luckily Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.

3M (MMM) is a stock many investors are watching right now. MMM is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 10.06 while its industry has an average P/E of 19.40. MMM's Forward P/E has been as high as 13.84 and as low as 8.97 with a median of 11.31 all within the past year.

Investors will also notice that MMM has a PEG ratio of 1.37. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. MMM's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.75. Within the past year MMM's PEG has been as high as 1.65 and as low as 1.09 with a median of 1.27.

These figures are just a handful of the metrics value investors tend to look at but they help show that 3M is likely being undervalued right now. Considering this as well as the strength of its earnings outlook MMM feels like a great value stock at the moment.

The turbine units will be installed at a 97 MW wind power project in Maharashtra India.



The wind power facility is planned to be commissioned in phases with full commissioning in the first half of 2025. Through this deal many industries and commercial foundations will be able to avail renewable energy. This collaboration will also support India’s target to reach 500 gigawatt (GW) of renewable energy capacity by 2030. Including the latest one General Electric has received 3.5 GW of orders to date for its Indian-made 2.7-132 wind turbines.



Lately General Electric has received a series of deals which are likely to drive its growth. In August this year GE secured two orders from Royal Golden Eagle Group’s subsidiary East Asia Power (Yangjiang) Co. Ltd. and Beijing Energy International Holding Co. Ltd. to deliver four units of 6F.03 gas turbines.



Also in July 2023 the company secured a deal from Hafslund Eco to supply rotor poles for Norway-based Aurland 1 hydropower plant’s 3x 280 MW / 300 MVA water-cooled generators.

Strong Segmental Performance

General Electric is benefiting from the strong performance of the Aerospace segment due to robust demand and solid execution in commercial engines and services. After months of softness a rebound in demand in the Power segment augurs well for General Electric. Strength in GE Gas Power’s heavy-duty gas turbines is aiding the Power segment. With higher equipment demand at Grid and Onshore Wind in North America signs of progress in the Renewables segment are encouraging.

Price Performance

In the past year the GE stock has increased 40.2% against the industry’s 10.5% decrease.

Andrew Abbott had the kind of introduction to the major leagues that 'Nuke' LaLoosh could only dream about. He announced his presence with authority. There's not a bit of hyperbole with this statement.

It was a historic start. The Reds left-hander achieved a number of monumental feats over the course of his first half dozen starts in the big leagues.

Dating back to 1893 when the pitcher's mound was moved to 60 feet 6 inches from home plate no starter had ever thrown three consecutive shutouts of at least five innings to begin their MLB career. That was until Abbott took the mound three times last season.

Abbott was also the first pitcher since 1900 to record at least 40 strikeouts while allowing 5 or fewer runs over his first six starts. I could rattle off more ridiculous stats but I'm sure you get the point already.

As unbelievable as Abbott pitched early on it was equally believable that he was unable to continue that pace over the course of the entire season. He admitted that fatigue may have played a factor.

""My arm was great. My arm was ready to go but my body was just like maybe I'm not getting a 100% out of it. Maybe I'm only getting 90 80 whatever it may be"" Abbott said. ""That has an impact. It's not an excuse by any means but it has an impact and it's a good thing for me to know.""

Abbott is back in Cincinnati for Redsfest this weekend at the Duke Energy Center and he has a family trip coming up this winter. But after a little rest and relaxation he is set to travel down to Texas to train with some of his teammates including Tejay Antone ahead of spring training.

The 24-year-old will focus on strength and conditioning as he aims to avoid a similar falloff in 2024.

""Big thing [is] longevity for me"" Abbott said. ""I knew to expect to throw a lot innings this year but I wanna throw even more next year. So it's just about having the [109.1 IP] as the floor and then being able to go deeper throughout the entire season and not having a dramatic fall off or anything like that. Just trying to be nice and stable the entire time.""

When Abbott ran into issues during his rookie campaign he found himself unable to limit hard contact against opposing hitters. So another goal for him this winter is to really refine his curveball and slider.

""Get 'em back to what they were at the beginning of the season and not where they were at the end"" he said. ""So when we come out of the gate then hopefully we hold it the entire time.""

On the surface Abbott is not a pitcher that is built to have sustained success at Great American Ball Park. Statistically he is a heavy fly ball pitcher. Wielding a 51.7% fly ball ratio over his 100 plus innings of work last year compared to rolling up a ground ball just 28.6% of the time.

Give Abbott credit though. It worked for him. Yes he gave up his fair share of home runs 16 of them last season but when compared with the rest of the league that's not an astronomical figure.

Had he pitched enough innings to qualify Abbott's 1.3 home runs over nine innings would have ranked him 34th in all of Major League Baseball right behind old friend Luis Castillo.

Bottom line don't expect Abbott to change his approach heading into next season.

""We have identities as players. Some guys hit homers. Some guys hit singles [and] steal bags. Some guys are average guys"" Abbott said. ""I think pitcher's are the same way. There's guys that throw a hundred that are strikeout guys. There's guys that throw in the low nineties that are more of like your command-ish guys that kind of rely on that. And I've always relied on my fastball and I've always relied on flyballs. Because that's just always been the makeup of me ever since I began pitching. So I don't think it's a thing to kind of change it. Maybe I would love to limit it a little more for sure.""

Abbott is just one of a number of talented young pitchers competing for a spot in the starting rotation next year.

Hunter Greene Graham Ashcraft and Nick Lodolo were supposed to be the three anchors that held down the starting rotation in 2023 but a series of injuries derailed that plan. Forcing the team to lean on the likes of Abbott Brandon Williamson and Connor Phillips down the stretch.

That experience for the younger guys could prove to be invaluable should they be called upon to throw significant innings again next season. Just like on offense the depth of talent available for the starting rotation is deep. Abbott believes everyone is going to play a vital role in the success of the team next year.

""It's gonna take all of us to get the job done at the end of the day. It's not gonna be one or two of us it's gonna be all five. Or guys that come up and fill the slots like we saw last year"" Abbott said. ""If we don't add [a veteran] then I think we have the pieces to go. Obviously that would help if [we] get a... whoever's out there on the market. I'm sure there's plenty of options out there. But I think we do have the pieces to make a run without 'em but I think it would help if we do get 'em.""

The Reds have already signed Nick Martinez to a two-year deal worth $26 million this offseason. He primarily pitched out of the bullpen for San Diego the past two years but the front office could view him as an option for the starting rotation.

Martinez made 19 starts for the Padres combined in 2022 and 2023 with a respectable 4-4 record and a 3.39 earned run average.

Cincinnati has also been linked to multiple pitchers on the trade market this offseason including the Rays' Tyler Glasnow and the Guardians' Shane Bieber.

Abbott will be ready for a significant role regardless of any moves the front office makes over the next few months.

On a call on Thursday he said the merger has 'the potential to transform the standard of care for people living with cancer'.

Gonzalez also noted that establishing a solid presence in solid tumors has been a ‘strategic priority’ for AbbVie and ImmunoGen represents an ‘extremely compelling opportunity’.

AbbVie now has control of Elahere an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) to treat platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC).

Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from gynecological cancers in the U.S and Elahere is the first targeted drug shown to boost survival rates for those with PROC.

The drug is forecast to generate around $500 million in sales in 2024. According to Barclays Wall Street analysts have also projected approximately $2 billion in peak sales at the end of the decade.

“AbbVie’s acquisition of ImmunoGen is strategically savvy as the deal bolsters AbbVie’s antibody drug conjugate (ADC) R&D capabilities especially in the solid tumor space while also delivering a differentiated ovarian cancer drug with blockbuster potential to support near-term growth” said Emma Gutstein healthcare sector analyst at Third Bridge.

“Our experts are excited about the potential of Elahere and believe it is well positioned to become the standard of care in this indication. The deal is a win-win as AbbVie’s significant global commercial platform and regulatory expertise should accelerate Elaher’s market uptake while strengthening AbbVie’s ADC technology platform and pipeline.”

ADC programs have recently generated a great deal of interest​ in the pharma industry.

Back in March Pfizer announced ​it was acquiring Seagen considered an ADC pioneer for $43 billion. In addition Merck revealed it was paying $4 billion to develop and commercialize three Daiichi Sankyo​ ADC treatments back in October.

Other companies that have picked up ADC assets include AstraZeneca BioNTech GSK and Bristol Myers Squibb.

ADC’s have surged in popularity as they have the potential to make cancer treatments more effective. These drugs deliver a targeted precise dose of chemotherapy directly to cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissue.

AbbVie and ImmunoGen said that positive phase 3 results from the MIRASOL confirmatory trial will support two future regulatory submissions a marketing authorization Application (MAA) to the European Union and a supplemental biologic license application (sBLA) submission to the FDA for full approval.

Ongoing clinical development programs are also underway designed to expand Elahere into earlier lines of therapy and enter other large patient segments of the ovarian market over the next 5–10 years.

Mark Enyedy CEO and president of ImmunoGen added: “With global commercial infrastructure and deep clinical and regulatory expertise AbbVie is the right company to accelerate geographic and label expansion and realize the full potential of ELAHERE as the first and only ADC approved in ovarian cancer.

“The addition of ImmunoGen’s pipeline platform and expertise to AbbVie’s oncology portfolio is an exciting opportunity for the combined companies to advance innovation in ADCs. This transaction is the culmination of our 40-year commitment to develop and deliver the next-generation of ADCs and more good days for people living with cancer.”

AbbVie expects the ImmunoGen deal to close in the middle of 2024 subject to shareholder approval regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cm9wZWFucGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWxyZXZpZXcuY29tL25ld3MvMTg5NTI0L2FiYnZpZS1hZ3JlZXMtMTAtYmlsbGlvbi1vbmNvbG9neS1hY3F1aXNpdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AbbVie agrees $10 billion oncology acquisition,"AbbVie agrees $10 billion oncology acquisition

AbbVie has agreed to acquire ImmunoGen and its first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) ELAHERE ® (mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx) for a total of approximately $10.1 billion.

The antibody-drug conjugate is the first to be approved for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC) and show meaningful survival benefit for this form of the disease. As a folate receptor alpha (FRα) with a maytansinoid payload DM4 a potent tubulin inhibitor the biologic medicine offers expansion opportunities in earlier lines of therapy and larger segments of the ovarian cancer market over the next five to 10 years. As such ongoing clinical development programmes are underway according to AbbVie.

The new proposed addition to AbbVie’s portfolio

The proposed acquisition will accelerate AbbVie’s entry into the commercial market for ovarian cancer.

Richard Gonzalez Chairman and Chief Executive Officer for AbbVie stated that the acquisition of ImmunoGen enables the company to further diversify its oncology pipeline across solid tumours and haematologic malignancies.

For example ImmunoGen’s next-generation anti-FRα antibody-drug conjugate IMGN-151 an ovarian cancer treatment with the potential for expansion into other solid tumour indications is currently being evaluated in Phase I. Additionally anti-CD123 antibody-drug conjugate Pivekimab sunirine is in Phase II. The treatment is targeting the rare blood cancer blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN).

Regulatory approvals for the antibody-drug conjugate

Antibody-drug conjugate ELAHERE was granted an accelerated marketing approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2022. It was indicated as a treatment for adult patients with FRα positive platinum-resistant epithelial ovarian fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who have received one to three prior systemic treatment regimens AbbVie noted. This indication is authorised under accelerated approval based on tumour response rate and durability of response.

Positive results from the confirmatory MIRASOL Phase III trial will support marketing application submissions to the US FDA with the aim of gaining full approval the company highlighted.

The pharmaceutical industry’s antibody-drug conjugate( ADC) deal spree continues.

AbbVie says it will buy ImmunoGen for about $10 billion adding to a series of multi-billion dollar acquisitions built around ADCs. Just a month ago Merck & Co. paid Daiichi Sankyo$ 4 billion to work together on three of these anticancer agents and Pfizer should soon complete its acquisition of the ADC expert Seagen for $43 billion. Gilead Sciences bought Immunomedics another ADC firm for $21 billion in 2020.

The centerpiece of the latest deal is ImmunoGen’s Elahere (mirvetuximab soravtansine) a first-in-class ADC that the US Food and Drug Administration approved in 2022 for ovarian cancer.

Elahere consists of an antibody that binds the folate receptor alpha (FRα) on the surface of ovarian cancer cells linked to a soravtansine payload that kills the cells by interfering with the cell cycle. It is the first ADC to target FRα and the second to use a small-molecule payload derived from maytansine a natural product first isolated from the flowering shrub Maytenus serrata.

Global sales of Elahere could reach $684 million in 2025 forecast analysts at the investment bank William Blair. “We see it as a good fit for AbbVie which needs new growth drivers” write William Blair’s Andy Hsieh and colleagues in a note to clients on the deal. AbbVie’s arthritis treatment Humira (adalimumab) the best-selling drug of all time is starting to face biosimilar competition. The firm’s cancer treatment Imbruvica (ibrutinib) its second-best seller is seeing increased competition from similar inhibitors.

“In our view the ADC modality continues to present as one of the most prized possessions from both a big pharma business development and investor perspective” the analysts write. The ImmunoGen acquisition will also speed up AbbVie’s progress in the solid tumor space they add.

ImmunoGen has three other ADCs in clinical trials. Pivekimab sunirine an anti-CD123 antibody attached to a novel indolinobenzodiazepine payload is in Phase 2 trials for a rare blood cancer. IMGN-151 a next-generation FRα-targeted ADC is in Phase 1 trials for ovarian cancer and IMGC936 an anti-ADAM9 ADC is also in Phase 1 trials for multiple solid tumor types.

The hunt is on for more targets linkers and payloads that can broaden the reach of ADCs. Nurix and Seagen partnered earlier this year to combine antibodies with targeted protein degraders. AbbVie’s own Phase 1 candidate ABBV-319 for blood cancers combines an antibody with a steroid payload.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hYmJ2aWUtYWJidi1hY3F1aXJlLWltbXVub2dlbi1pbWduLTEwNTUwMDgzNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AbbVie (ABBV) to Acquire ImmunoGen (IMGN) for $10.1 Billion,"AbbVie ABBV has announced a definitive agreement to acquire cancer biotech ImmunoGen IMGN for $10.1 billion including its new ovarian cancer drug Elahere.

Elahere (mirvetuximab soravtansine) is a first-in-class antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that was granted accelerated approval by the FDA in November 2022 for the treatment of platinum-resistant ovarian cancer (PROC). AbbVie believes the acquisition will diversify its oncology pipeline across solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.

Per the deal terms AbbVie will pay ImmunoGen $31.26 per share in cash which adds up to a total equity value of approximately $10.1 billion. The purchase price of $31.26 represents quite a rich premium of almost 95% on ImmunoGen’s closing price of $16.06 on Nov 29. ImmunoGen’s stock rose nearly 83% on Thursday. AbbVie’s stock was up around 2.8%.

In the year so far AbbVie’s stock has lost 11.9% against the industry’s 4.3% rise.

ImmunoGen’s stock has shot up 491.7% in the year so far against the industry’s 12.7% decline. Robust sales of Elahere which was approved only in 2022 have led to the price increase.

Elahere is the first and only ADC approved for ovarian cancer. ImmunoGen recorded $212 million in Elahere product sales in the first nine months of 2023 which exceeded management’s expectations.

AbbVie has filed a supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) with the FDA seeking to convert the accelerated approval for Elahere to full approval based on data from the MIRASOL confirmatory study. A potential approval is expected in the first half of 2024. Management has filed a marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency seeking approval of Elahere in FRα-high PROC with a potential nod expected in late 2024.

Elahere is also being evaluated in multiple studies both as monotherapy and in combination with other drugs for ovarian cancer which will expand the drug’s use in earlier lines of therapy and additional patient populations. ImmunoGen has some promising ADC candidates in its pipeline like pivekimab sunirine (in phase II studies for blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm) and IMGN-151 (in phase I for ovarian cancer).

The transaction is expected to close in mid-2024 subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. The boards of directors of both companies have approved the transaction.

The M&A trend of 2023 shows that there is an increasing interest in biotech companies making innovative cancer treatments. In October Bristol Myers Squibb BMY announced that it will acquire commercial-stage oncology company Mirati Therapeutics for a total equity value of $4.8 billion-plus contingent value right of approximately $1.0 billion. The acquisition will add Mirati’s new lung cancer drug Krazati(adagrasib) to BMY’s strong oncology portfolio.

Story continues

In the same month Eli Lilly LLY offered to buy POINT Biopharma a maker of next-generation radioligand therapies for treating cancers for approximately $1.4 billion in cash. Radioligand therapy is a type of precision cancer treatment that combines a targeting compound (ligand) with a therapeutic radioisotope (a radioactive particle). The acquisition of POINT Biopharma will bolster Lilly’s portfolio of cancer drugs. Pfizer offered to buy cancer drugmaker Seagen for $43 billion in March. The acquisition is expected to be closed in late 2023 or early 2024.

AbbVie is looking to file for accelerated approval of telisotuzumab vedotin (Teliso-V) after reporting positive topline Phase II results for its investigational c-Met protein directed antibody-drug conjugate which showed a “compelling” overall response rate in patients with previously treated non-small cell lung cancer.

The Phase II LUMINOSITY results announced on Wednesday were for patients with c-Met protein overexpression epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild type and advanced metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). According to AbbVie the data showed an overall response rate of 35% across c-Met high and 23% for c-Met intermediate patients respectively.

Other endpoints included a median duration of response of nine months and a median overall survival of 14.6 months for c-Met High patients 7.2 months for time of response and 14.2 months for median overall survival in intermediate patients. AbbVie also said the safety profile has been “consistent with previous findings” with no new concerns.

“The results of the Phase II LUMINOSITY trial are encouraging for those patients with non-small cell lung cancer with c-Met overexpression as there is a critical need for better care and additional therapy options for them” Ross Camidge a principal investigator for the trial and director of thoracic oncology clinical and clinical research programs at the University of Colorado said in a statement.

AbbVie will post the full details of the data at a future medical meeting. The company said it is talking to global health authorities about the potential for accelerated approval. The investigational first-in-class ADC already has a breakthrough designation from the FDA.

“Results from the Phase II LUMINOSITY trial mark an important step forward for AbbVie’s mission to advance new oncology treatments across our ADC program targeting solid tumor types with critical patient needs” Roopal Thakkar AbbVie’s CMO and senior vice president of development and regulatory affairs said in a statement.

The ADC is being evaluated as a monotherapy in the Phase III TeliMET NSCLC-01 trial which is enrolling patients with previously treated c-Met overexpressing EGFR wild type nonsquamous NSCLC across the U.S. Brazil Europe and parts of Asia.

In related news AbbVie on Thursday announced that it is buying ImmunoGen for $10.1 billion including its ADC Elahere for platinum-resistant ovarian cancer which was granted FDA accelerated approval last year. ImmunoGen’s pipeline of next-generation ADCs complements AbbVie’s existing programs according to the announcement. AbbVie is the latest big pharma to target the hot ADC market.

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Particularly we will be paying attention to Accenture's ROE today.

ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.

Check out our latest analysis for Accenture

How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?

ROE can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So based on the above formula the ROE for Accenture is:

26% = US$7.0b ÷ US$26b (Based on the trailing twelve months to August 2023).

The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments the company generates a profit of $0.26.

What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?

We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"" and how effectively it does so we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged the higher the ROE and profit retention the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.

A Side By Side comparison of Accenture's Earnings Growth And 26% ROE

Firstly we acknowledge that Accenture has a significantly high ROE. Second a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 13% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This likely paved the way for the modest 11% net income growth seen by Accenture over the past five years.

As a next step we compared Accenture's net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 22% in the same period.

The basis for attaching value to a company is to a great extent tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings whichever the case may be is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Accenture's's valuation check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio as compared to its industry.

Is Accenture Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?

With a three-year median payout ratio of 39% (implying that the company retains 61% of its profits) it seems that Accenture is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees respectable amount growth in its earnings and pays a dividend that's well covered.

Moreover Accenture is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 39%. Therefore the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 28%.

Conclusion

In total we are pretty happy with Accenture's performance. Particularly we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business and at a high rate of return. As a result the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. With that said the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

This comes as Accenture seeks to strengthen the regional creative brand and data capabilities of its creative division Accenture Song. It aims to helps clients build and optimise digital experiences across the entire customer lifecycle for growth in Thailand.

The acquisition aims to ride on the growing importance of digital advertising spending for brand differentiation and customer connection. As one of the top three focus markets in the Asia Pacific (APAC) region Thailand has seen digital advertising spend increase by 9.12% from 2021 to reach US$3.6 billion in 2022 according to a Nielson report.

Founded in 2010 Rabbit's Tale offers digital customer experience solutions ranging from retail experiences to customer relationship management and loyalty programmes.

Through this it seeks to bring credibility in crafting impactful brand strategies driving digital content and executing data-driven experiences. Some notable clients it has previously worked with across various sectors include Honda Motorcycle Ajinomoto GQ Apparel and Siam Commercial Bank.

Rabbit’s Tale’s team of approximately 120 employees across advertising data and interactive and customer experience solutions business groups will join Accenture Song in Thailand. The combined team will build upon Accenture’s strategy design performance technology and large-scale operations capaibilities to help clients navigate and create transformational change.

“Consumer and employee expectations have drastically changed leading businesses to seek partners with the scale and skills for delivering unique yet powerful engagement and connections. They are also looking for creative solutions and transformative programs to advance growth” said Thomas Mouritzen Southeast Asia lead for Accenture Song (pictured centre).

He added that the addition of Rabbit’s Tale would bring more firepower to Accenture Song’s regional market excellence and business strategy as it leverages data innovation and creativity.

“This reaffirms our unwavering investment and commitment in Southeast Asia enhancing our offerings capabilities and talent base to help clients achieve tangible outcomes in their brand marketing and experience transformation journeys” he said.

Patama Chantaruck country managing director Thailand at Accenture (pictured right) added that the acquisition will help Accenture to empower local businesses and nurture homegrown talent to create meaningful and highly personalised digital experiences. These seek to cater to the unique needs and preferences of the Thai market.

“Technology when integrated with creativity can significantly enhance how businesses interact with their customers and people driving differentiation and fostering greater customer satisfaction and loyalty” she added.

She expressed the hope that the combined talent and expertise will strengthen Accenture’s positioning to help grow Thailand’s private sector and address its most complex challenges.

The acquisition also advances Accenture Song’s strategy to help its clients create new roadmaps to growth through tech-powered creativity according to Flaviano Faleiro Accenture Song’s president for growth markets.

He cited how 97% of C-suite executives feel that their accelerated digital transformation efforts merely allow them to keep pace and not achieve new growth and customer relevance. He stated that Rabbit’s Tale’s capabilities can bridge that gap by enhancing how Accenture Song builds and scales creative and digital customer experience solutions for its clients in growth markets.

Sunard Thanasanaksorn CEO of Rabbit’s Tale (pictured left) added that the next stage of growth with Accenture Song looks forward to use Rabbit’s Tale’s industry-leading position and creativity-led approach with data and technology to help businesses across industries to set new benchmarks.

This acquisition also mark Accenture’s third acquisition in Southeast Asia after Romp in 2022 and Entropia in 2021.

In 2022 it acquired brand and experience agency Romp in Indonesia to strengthen Accenture Song’s ability to deliver creative and tech-driven brand experiences for clients across Southeast Asia.

Romp which started up in 2019 made a name for itself for its creative talent and innovative services across branding creative and performance marketing in Indonesia. The agency was founded by the long-time former CEO of MullenLowe Indonesia Joseph Tan who made waves in the Indonesian advertising scene leaving the firm after 12 years.

“Joining Accenture Song will fully converge the brand storytelling that we love with Accenture’s tech innovation enabling us to help our clients truly deliver against limitless opportunities with global impact” said Joseph Tan Romp’s chief executive officer at the time.

A year earlier it made its first acquisition in SEA with Kuala Lumpur-based Entropia. Founded in 2016 by founder and senior partner Prashant Kumar Entropia brought more than 210 employees to the acquisition. The move aimed to expand Accenture Song’s (then named Accenture Interactive) creative talent pool creating more learning and growth opportunities for employees across both organisations.

Investors have pushed Microsoft (MSFT 0.20%) stock to new highs in recent weeks. The tech giant's share price performance is trouncing the wider market having soared nearly 60% this year. By comparison the Nasdaq Composite gained 36%.

Some investors are concerned that this rally has made Microsoft a less compelling growth stock. It's approaching $3 trillion in market capitalization after all and Wall Street is well aware of its many sales catalysts ahead. These include artificial intelligence (AI) and the rising demand for video games and cybersecurity software in the years to come.

If you'd like exposure to some of these industries but are turned off by Microsoft's elevated valuation there are some good alternatives to consider. Read on for reasons to buy Adobe (ADBE -1.20%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW -0.73%) instead.

Adobe is cashing in on AI

Adobe stock is riding on a wave of enthusiasm about generative AI but it isn't just hype that's elevating investor sentiment in 2023. The software giant is already capitalizing on AI tech that's made its way into products like Photoshop and Premiere Pro. In mid-September Adobe revealed that higher demand across its portfolio has helped push profit to $4.9 billion in the first half of 2023 up from $4.5 billion a year earlier.

Adobe's focus on content creation positions it well to take full advantage of the rising value that AI is delivering. You can see evidence of that excitement in the fact that people have generated 2 billion images using its new Firefly software in just the first six months following its release. Subscription services are rising too contributing to impressive cash-flow trends.

The company is valued at a premium to Microsoft. But growth-stock investors see good reasons to like shares at the current valuation of 15x sales compared to Microsoft's price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 13. Its smaller sales footprint and greater focus on creative content could make Adobe a huge winner in the next era of computing tech.

Palo Alto Networks can keep its momentum

Microsoft offers cybersecurity protection as part of its huge services platform but investors might earn better returns from owning Palo Alto Networks over the next several years. Sure investors were a bit disappointed with the company's earnings update in late November which showed slowing billings trends.

Yet sales were up a healthy 20% in the Q3 period and are on track to rise at nearly the same pace for the full year. Most Wall Street pros are looking for Microsoft to grow at 4% this fiscal year by contrast.

An investment in Palo Alto Networks doesn't offer nearly the same level of diversity and safety that comes along with Microsoft's massive global sales base. You don't get a dividend from owning this cybersecurity business either.

Still investors who value growth will love Palo Alto Networks' expanding market share and its healthy market share in a competitive niche. Management is determined to keep boosting profitability as well building on the excellent momentum that shareholders saw here last year.

As is the case with Adobe you'll pay a higher premium to own Palo Alto right now as compared to late 2022. But for roughly the same price-to-sales valuation as Microsoft you'll get exposure to a leading software-as-a-service provider in an industry that's likely to see fantastic growth over the next several years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWluZm9ybWF0aW9uLmNvbS9icmllZmluZ3MvYWRvYmUtc2hhcmVzLWZhbGwtb24tbG93ZXItdGhhbi1leHBlY3RlZC0yMDI0LWd1aWRhbmNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Briefing: Adobe Shares Fall on Lower-Than-Expected 2024 Guidance,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/adobe-shares-fall-on-lower-than-expected-2024-guidance on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWluZm9ybWF0aW9uLmNvbS9icmllZmluZ3MvYWRvYmUtc2hhcmVzLWZhbGwtb24tbG93ZXItdGhhbi1leHBlY3RlZC0yMDI0LWd1aWRhbmNl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hemNlbnRyYWwuY29tL3N0b3J5L25ld3MvbG9jYWwvcGhvZW5peC8yMDIzLzEyLzAxL3NhbmRyYS1kYXktb2Nvbm5vci1sZWdhY3ktcGhvZW5peC1hcml6b25hLWhlci1hZG9iZS1ob3VzZS1jaXZpY3MvMTQ1MDM1NzAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sandra Day O'Connor legacy in Phoenix from her adobe house to civics,"No commitment required.

AMD,Advanced Micro Devices,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAxLzEtZ3JlZW4tZmxhZy1hZHZhbmNlZC1taWNyby1kZXZpY2VzLXN0b2NrLTIwMjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,1 Green Flag for Advanced Micro Devices Stock in 2023 and 1 Red Flag,"Investors have high expectations for the chipmaker in 2024.

Investors have piled into Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 1.36%) stock in 2023 driving the shares up 89% year to date. After a temporary pullback over the summer the stock surged higher following the release of the company's third-quarter financial results.

There are good reasons to be bullish on AMD's growth prospects. It is enjoying solid momentum in sales of central processing units (CPUs). However mixed results across AMD's business have caused analysts to start reducing growth estimates in the near term.

Here are one green flag and one red flag for the stock as we look ahead to 2024.

Green flag: AMD is winning the CPU battle

AMD primarily competes with Intel in CPUs and Nvidia in graphics processing units (GPUs). Investors have low expectations regarding its ability to beat Nvidia in the GPU market so that's why AMD's momentum in CPUs is a positive for the stock.

In the third-quarter update AMD revealed strength across the board in CPUs for enterprise servers and consumer PCs. Data center revenue grew 21% over the second quarter reflecting strong demand for the fourth-generation EPYC ""Genoa"" chips for servers.

While AMD noted that enterprise demand remains soft overall CEO Lisa Su cited Genoa's performance and helping companies save money on cost of ownership as factors driving double-digit growth in enterprise revenue last quarter.

On the consumer side AMD's Ryzen CPUs have become the chip of choice for PC gamers. Client segment revenue jumped 46% over the previous quarter thanks to strong demand for the Ryzen 7000 series chips.

AMD is receiving great feedback from prospective customers for its next-generation Turing processors and MI300 accelerators for enterprise servers which could drive more growth in 2024.

Red flag: There are holes in AMD's performance

AMD is not firing on all cylinders. In the third quarter total revenue increased by just 4% year over year and 8% over the previous quarter. AMD's diversification across several chip products may be its biggest weakness right now as it struggles to catch Nvidia in the GPU market.

AMD's data center segment reported flat growth year over year in the third quarter. The strong growth of EPYC CPUs was offset by a decline in adaptive System-on-Chip (SoC) products.

AMD is also still experiencing weakness in gaming. Strong sales of Radeon gaming GPUs were offset by weakness in sales of processors for video game consoles.

For the fourth quarter management forecasts total revenue will be up approximately 9% year over year and 5% over the third quarter. The company will need to show accelerating growth next year to justify the stock's relatively higher valuation compared to Nvidia.

Analysts have been reducing their growth forecasts for AMD while hiking estimates for Nvidia. This isn't surprising considering Nvidia continues to blow away Wall Street's expectations while AMD is still struggling with a soft market across its product portfolio.

AMD may get the ball rolling next year with its new MI300 GPU accelerators designed for AI workloads. But investors are still being asked to pay a premium for a company that is far behind the leader in GPUs. The safest path for investors is to wait for AMD to report better growth after it launches its new AI chips before buying the stock. There is the risk that the MI300 chips don't move the needle as expected which may limit the stock's performance next year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvaXMtYWR2YW5jZWQtbWljcm8tZGV2aWNlcy10aGUtbmV4dC1icmVha291dC1haS1zdG9jay10by1idXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Advanced Micro Devices the Next Breakout AI Stock to Buy?,"Wall Street is bullish on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) as it releases a batch of new graphics processing units (GPUs) that are designed to support artificial intelligence (AI). This burgeoning opportunity has sent shares of Nvidia up 230% in 2023 and investors are hopeful that AMD stock which has nearly doubled this year will perform similarly in 2024.

AMD also has a big opportunity on the consumer side with its Ryzen processors so the chipmaker is not lacking for potential growth drivers. That being said management's latest guidance for 2024 leaves some doubt about the stock's upside potential next year.

AMD's CEO is excited about this opportunity

AMD has been taking market share from Intel in recent years and it may have taken more last quarter. While AMD's total revenue grew just 4% year over year in the third quarter client segment revenue grew by 42% year over year and 46% over the second quarter driven by demand for its Ryzen 7000 series central processing units (CPUs).

Many customers who buy Ryzen CPUs are people who play video games on PCs but there could be new categories of customers buying AMD-powered PCs for multitasking video streaming and productivity software. New software applications that take advantage of AI will require even more powerful CPUs.

Within the PC market AMD CEO Lisa Su said she is most excited about the opportunity in PCs designed to support AI-heavy applications. ""I think we're at the beginning of a wave there. We're investing heavily in Ryzen AI and the opportunity to really broaden sort of the AI capabilities of PCs going forward.""

Microsoft has released AI features for Windows such as Bing Chat and Copilot. The arrival of more software like this will serve as a catalyst for long-term growth in AMD's Ryzen CPU business.

How high can AMD stock go in 2024?

Investors are expecting AMD's momentum in CPUs to carry over to the GPU market as AMD launches a new batch of AI GPUs. This is why the stock has climbed 93% this year despite slow growth across the business lately.

However AMD's guidance calls for data center GPU revenue to be just $400 million in the fourth quarter which isn't much. For 2024 the company expects revenue from that part of its business to reach $2 billion compared to total revenue of $26 billion based on analysts' consensus estimate.

AMD's guidance leaves some doubt about the impact its new GPUs will have on near-term growth. But investors may have to be patient here. Over the next four years management expects data center GPU revenue to grow 50% per year. That would result in $10 billion in revenue from that segment by 2027.

Nvidia reported $14 billion in data center revenue last quarter up 279% year over year and that was with a limited supply of GPUs available. Nvidia is working hard to make enough chips to meet demand so there will be plenty of opportunity for two competitors in the data center GPU market.

AMD's offerings will have something different to help them stand out from those of its rival. The new MI300 chips will feature generous quantities of memory bandwidth which is useful in working with massive amounts of data.

Still AMD's near-term guidance is a problem for a stock that is currently more expensive than Nvidia on a forward price-to-earnings basis. Unless AMD blows past its guidance in the coming quarters the stock may have limited upside next year.

If you're thinking of buying shares expecting large gains in 2024 I would be careful. I would only consider buying AMD right now if you plan on holding the stock for at least five years.

AMD previously estimated its long-term addressable market at $300 billion for all chip products in the data center gaming and consumer PC segments. That gives it a long runway for growth and should lead to market-beating returns for patient investors.

The market was expecting more after Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) gave a glimmer of hope that recovery is picking up just in head of the holidays. Its results mirror PC market trends its rival HP Inc (NYSE: HPQ) reflected when it guided for a weaker-than-expected first-quarter profit due to a slow PC market recovery and weak demand in China. Upon the report Dell shares went down 4% after the bell.

Third Quarter Highlights

Revenue for the quarter ended on November 3rd Dell reported sequentially flat revenue that dropped 12% YoY to $22.25 billion with earnings of $1.01 billion. Operating income amounted to nearly $1.5 million while non-GAAP operating income amounted to $2 billion. With a profit of $1.36 per share adjusted earnings amounted to $1.88 per share.

Dell’s client solutions group that is home to its consumer and enterprise PC business reported revenue dropped 11% YoY to $12.28 billion. However servers and networking business revenue reported a sequential revenue rise of 9% sequentially on the back of fueled interest in genAI.

PC Market Recovery Is Picking Up But Slowly...

Last month research firm Gartner reported that Dell posted a six consecutive decline in PC shipments from July to September due to weak spending by its essential enterprise customer base that resulted from a sluggish economy. According to the research firm global third quarter PC shipments declined 9% with Dell ranking third behind Lenovo Group Limited (OTC: LNVGY) and HP but coming ahead of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Another research firm Canalys provided an optimistic outlook of PC market thriving on the back of AI boost. Canalys expects the adoption of AI-powered PCs to accelerate from 2025 onwards with these revolutionary devices making about 60% of all PCs shipped by 2027. Over the next two weeks AMD and Intel will be unveiling their new AI offerings and developments that threaten to trip the AI chip powerhouse Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA). Although Nvidia powered the generative AI revolution with its power chips this market is still in its infancy and AMD and Intel are working hard to catch up. Although Nvidia posted a stellar quarter even the AI chip leader was cautious with its sales guidance that missed lofty numbers that are being whispered throughout Wall Street. With AMD and Intel striking back even Nvidia could trip. Although it is certain that AI will shape the next PC era only time will show exactly how will that look like and if the hype is justified.

Marvell reported an 8% year-over-year decline in revenue in the third quarter slightly better than analysts anticipated.

Marvell Technology Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Matthew Murphy attributed the revenue decline to weak macroeconomic conditions.

Marvell Technology Inc. (MRVL) shares fell over 5% early Friday after the chip maker's revenue declined and its forecast for the fourth quarter came in lower than expected amid a ""weak environment.""

While Marvell's year-over-year revenue decline of 8% to $1.42 billion was slightly better than analysts anticipated but its fourth-quarter forecast at $1.42 billion missed estimates. A GAAP-adjusted per-share loss of 19 cents was an improvement over the second quarter's 24-cent per-share loss and narrowed from the year-ago third-quarter per-share loss of 63 cents.

For the nine months ended Oct. 28 2023 Marvell posted a net loss of $540.7 million. In the same period in 2022 it's net loss was much narrower at $148.1 million.

Marvell Technology CEO Matthew Murphy blamed the recent lackluster performance on the broader market telling Reuters ""You've seen it in announcements from the big enterprise companies and you've also seen it from the carrier companies. It's a very weak environment.""

Despite Friday's decline Marvell shares were up over 46% year-to-date.

After establishing our presence in Europe North America and Australia we are now entering the 4th continent - Asia. As an experienced owner and operator of similar power plants we are proud to take over the operator role from AES. We appreciate the strong diplomatic and business ties between Vietnam and the Czech Republic and look forward to a cooperation including working together on satisfying all regulatory requirements. We also aspire to engage in more public-private deals like this one.”

Sev.en GI's primary goal is to ensure energy security while also foster the economic safe and reliable operation of the power plant and supporting the employees and local communities. Alan Svoboda added: “We are a strategic long-term investor with a wealth of expertise in the management of power generation and mining assets. We own and operate our assets with experienced local managers supported by our central team of technical and commodity experts. We always strive to share the knowledge across our whole portfolio. We were impressed by the local Mong Duong 2 management team as well as the excellent status of the plant. We will continue to maintain these high standards. “

Meeting at the Ministry of Industry and Trade of Vietnam



The acquisition is a significant milestone as it would be the largest Czech investment in Vietnam. This transaction further deepens the already close bilateral trade relations between the two countries. Hynek Kmoníček Ambassador of Czech Republic to Vietnam said of the transaction: ""We welcome this by far the largest Czech strategic investment. It moves our country into the first league of foreign investors in Vietnam and broader Southeast Asia. I congratulate Sev.en and hope that successful closing of this transaction will attract further Czech investments into Vietnam.""

To understand Dan Amos’ approach to leadership consider the first role he took at Aflac after graduating from the University of Georgia in 1973. As son of cofounder Paul Amos one of three brothers who founded the insurance company in 1955 he could have hung out in the head office. Instead he started in sales.

“I wanted an objective job not a subjective job” says Amos 72 who went on to become the top salesman of the supplemental health and life insurance company—and its CEO in 1990. “Goal-setting always intrigued me and was something I liked.”

Let’s find out why this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining at the moment.

High-return Projects Productivity Aid APD

Air Products is expected to benefit from its investments in high-return industrial gas projects and productivity measures. Higher volumes and pricing are also likely to support its results.



The company remains focused on its gasification strategy and is executing its growth projects. These projects are expected to be accretive to earnings and cash flows. APD is realizing the benefits of the completion of the second phase of the Jazan project in Saudi Arabia. The company has a total available capacity to deploy (over fiscal 2023-2032) $32.5 billion in high-return investments aimed at creating significant shareholder value.



Air Products is also driving productivity to improve its cost structure. It is seeing the positive impacts of its productivity actions. Benefits from additional productivity and cost improvement programs are likely to support its margins moving ahead.



The company also remains committed to maximize returns to shareholders leveraging strong balance sheet and cash flows. APD earlier this year increased its quarterly dividend by 8% to $1.75 per share from $1.62 per share. This marked the 41st straight year of dividend increase. The company expects to pay roughly $1.5 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2023.

Slowdown in Europe & China Ails

The slowdown in China and Europe may affect the company’s business in these regions. The sluggish China economy might impact volumes in the Industrial Gases - Asia segment. A slower economic recovery in China and the softness in electronics may affect the segment’s volumes. Air Products is also seeing weak demand for merchant products in Europe. The lack of growth in industrial output in Europe is a concern over the near term.

In a newly-published paper in Environmental Science & Technology a journal of the American Chemical Society (ACS) Nusrat Jung an assistant professor in the Lyles School of Civil Engineering discovered that several chemicals particularly cyclic volatile methyl siloxanes — which are ubiquitous in hair care products — linger in the air after use. On average Jung’s team reports a person can inhale a cumulative mass of 1-17 milligrams of potentially harmful chemicals in a single hair care session in their home.

“We found the results to be extremely alarming” Jung said. “We did not expect to see such significant emissions of volatile chemical mixtures from off-the-shelf hair care products during typical hair care routines that many people perform each and every day.”

The Main Culprit: D5 Siloxane

The often greatest — and most concerning — chemical inhaled Jung said is decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (aka D5 siloxane). It is an organosilicon compound and is often listed first or second in the ingredient lists of many hair care products indicating it can be among the most abundant ingredients. It has become a common ingredient over the past few decades in many personal care products due to its low surface tension inertness high thermal stability and smooth texture.

“D5 siloxane has been found to lead to adverse effects on the respiratory tract liver and nervous system of laboratory animals” Jung said. “The use of the chemical in wash-off cosmetic products has already been restricted in the European Union because of this. Many of these products are scented too and some of the chemicals used to make these fragrances are potentially dangerous to inhale as well.”

According to the European Chemicals Agency D5 siloxane is classified as “very persistent very bioaccumulative.” And while the test results on laboratory animals are already concerning Jung said there is little information on its human impact.

“There has not been much in-depth research into this so we really have no idea to what extent the threat these chemicals pose when inhaled over a long period of time” Jung said. “There have been tests into ‘wash-off’ products like shampoos but almost none for ‘leave-on’ products like hair gels oils creams waxes and sprays.”

Jung’s research also noted that applying high heat to these chemicals such as through curling irons and hair straighteners serves to further release the chemicals into the air. When met with temperatures of 210 degrees Celsius researchers found the chemical emissions from the hair care products increased anywhere from 50% to 310%.

Widespread Urban Impact

To make matters worse Jung said these airborne chemicals do not merely remain in a single room — or even just the home.

“Home ventilation is likely a major pathway of indoor-to-outdoor siloxane transport” Jung said. “In urban environments this is especially significant as you will have hundreds — even thousands — of homes ventilating out potentially harmful chemicals into the urban atmosphere all in a short span of time as people get ready for work and school in the morning. These chemicals are then collectively piped back into buildings through ventilation systems once more. So even if using products with harmful chemicals is not part of your hair care routine you will still be impacted due to your surroundings in an urban environment.”

Surveys on different population groups indicate that 16% to 70% of participants use leave-on hair care or hair styling products Jung’s research reported. Considering an average use frequency of hair care products between two and five times per week based on surveys on hair care product usage patterns and assuming that 10% of leave-on hair care products are siloxane-based the total indoor-to-outdoor emission of D5 could reach 0.4 to 6 metric tons per year in the U.S.

So how can people protect themselves from inhaling these chemicals?

“The best solution is to simply not use these products” Jung said. “I used to use similar products myself to straighten my hair but after we analyzed the data it became immediately clear that the best thing I could do to protect my own health was to stop using them.”

If one must use these products the next best thing is to have an exhaust fan running to minimize the amount of chemicals inhaled said Purdue civil engineering PhD student and researcher Jinglin Jiang.

“Ventilation can be an effective way to reduce siloxane exposures during indoor hair care routines” Jiang said. “Our model shows that turning on the bathroom exhaust fan can reduce D5 inhalation exposures by over 90%.”

That however further contributes to its environmental impact. Jung’s research reports that the cumulative indoor-to-outdoor D5 emission with the exhaust fan always off reaches 710 milligrams within three hours while the indoor-to-outdoor D5 emission with the exhaust fan always on reaches 900 milligrams within only one hour.

“There’s a good reason why these chemicals are restricted from being used in wash-off hair care products in certain parts of the world” Jung said. “The effects on people and the planet need to be studied further and regulatory action needs to be taken.”

Gathering the data

Jung’s experimental research was conducted in a residential architectural engineering laboratory that she designed: the Purdue zero Energy Design Guidance for Engineers (zEDGE) Tiny House.

zEDGE is a mechanically ventilated single-zone residential building with a conditioned interior. A state-of-the-art proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) from Jung’s laboratory was used to measure D5 siloxanes and other volatile chemicals in the indoor air in real-time second-by-second.

The hair care routine emission experiments were conducted during a measurement campaign in zEDGE over a period of several months including three experiment types: realistic hair care experiments that replicate actual hair care routines in the home environment hot plate emission experiments that explore the relationship between the temperature of the hair care tools and volatile organic compound emissions and surface area emission experiments that investigate how hair surface area impacts volatile organic compound emissions during hair care events.

For the realistic hair care routine emission experiments participants were asked to bring their own hair care products and hair styling tools to replicate their routines in zEDGE. Prior to each experiment the participants were instructed to separate their hair into four sections. The hair length of each participant was categorized as long hair (below the shoulder) or short hair (above the shoulder). The sequence of each experiment consisted of four periods to replicate a real-life routine.

After hair styling the participants had two minutes to collect the tools and leave zEDGE; this was followed by a 60-minute concentration decay period in which zEDGE was unoccupied and the high-resolution PTR-TOF-MS monitored the decay in indoor volatile organic compound concentrations. The experiments and subsequent analysis focused on indoor volatile organic compound concentrations and emissions during and after active hair care routine periods.

For years it has been illegal for homes in New York City to be rented out for fewer than 30 days. However the ordinance was hardly enforced. And many property owners earned money through the rise of short-term rentals.

But the city in September began enforcing a new ordinance that requires short-term rental hosts to register with the city. The ordinance which passed in January 2022 but had been held up in court also ices out market juggernauts Airbnb Vrbo and similar platforms from processing transactions for any unregistered short-term rentals.

Hosts can get city approval to offer short-term rentals only if they are on the premises during the visitors’ stay and if the number of guests is limited to two. That’s expected to severely limit the number of available rentals since few hosts are willing to meet those requirements.

In recent weeks thousands of New York City short-term rentals have vanished from Airbnb’s webpage and on Dec. 2 the company will cancel and refund all reservations for unregistered rentals made through the portal. The city and company had agreed to allow all previous reservations with check-ins by Dec. 1.

The aim of the crackdown is to return thousands of possible long-term rental units to the city’s housing market which is short on available and affordable options.

If New York City’s approach is successful policy experts think other cities might emulate the city’s restrictions. But the city faces an uphill battle in meeting the sizable demand for short-term stays; tourism promoters predict 63.3 million visitors this year and hotel occupancy hovers near 90%. And many observers doubt whether such limits would significantly reopen housing units to long-term tenants.

Officials from the Mayor’s Special Office of Enforcement the agency tasked with registering legal short-term rentals in New York City told Stateline that there are slightly more than 800 licensed short-term legal rentals entering December. In August there were nearly 22000 Airbnb short-term rentals alone.

More than 5170 applications had been submitted to the office as of Nov. 20 with about 500 denied and more than 1700 sent back to applicants for added information or to “correct deficiencies” in the application.

Jorge González a researcher with the Urban Institute a nonprofit think tank said the success of New York’s crackdown will depend on whether hotels can pick up the slack.

Rentals and housing

The nation’s housing crunch has many officials blaming short-term rentals for taking shelter off the market. A 2016 article in the Harvard Law & Policy Review suggested that short-term rentals “[reduce] the affordable housing supply” by removing long-term rentals from the housing market and keeping local residents from moving in.

Dozens of localities throughout the United States have regulated short-term rentals.

But none has gone as far as New York City.

“The law and rules effectively ban short-term rentals in New York City and are a stark contrast to cities around the world that have enacted fair and balanced short-term rental rules” wrote Theo Yedinsky Airbnb’s global policy director in a June letter on the company’s website.

Airbnb says it worked for years to find a compromise.

“These rules are an outlier and stand in contrast to the approach of other cities around the country going as far as to prohibit New Yorkers from sharing their homes when they are away for work or travel hosting more than two guests at the same time and requiring that they must certify they understand numerous lengthy and complicated city codes” the company wrote in a prepared statement in response to Stateline.

González said policies to regulate the short-term rental market in both domestic and international cities have varied from capping the length of a rental stay to restricting the number of guests to requiring the host to be on the premises.

“If New York City’s policy is successful it could embolden other cities to follow suit and use this as a way to not only rein in this industry but possibly address these long-term rental housing crises” said González. “I think there will be a lot learned in the next few weeks and months on whether this is an effective policy measure.”

One of the consequences of the city’s crackdown on Airbnb listings is already taking shape. More than 90% of the city’s current Airbnb rental stock of nearly 40000 units — of which 3746 are short-term rentals — is unlicensed according to Inside Airbnb a housing activist group that tracks the platform’s data.

The fear of rising hotel prices and the dearth of legal rentals are prompting some tourists to turn to short-term rentals listed on Craigslist part of a burgeoning alternative market of unregistered unlicensed short-term rentals in the wake of the city’s restrictions.

For travelers such as Dustin Smith and his fiancée Carly Barnes it’s worth the risk when they visit New York City for the first time on Dec. 21 for a two-week stay.

“New York is already stretching our budget just to eat and sightsee so if we can get a good deal on the internet without paying an arm and a leg for a hotel we’ll take that chance” Smith who lives in Louisiana told Stateline.

Christian Klossner executive director of New York City’s Office of Special Enforcement told Stateline that his office will monitor the short-term rental industry as a whole including those spaces advertised on Craigslist and other sites. Hosts who violate the ordinance face a possible fine of $5000 and platforms could face penalties up to $1500.

City and state tensions

Bed-and-breakfasts a forerunner of today’s short-term rentals always have had a place in the hospitality sector. The market was intended for family-run operators researchers and industry experts told Stateline.

But the rise of home-sharing platforms has led to a “hotelization” of residential neighborhoods and with that concerns and calls from residents for more regulation.

A 2019 Economic Policy Institute study concluded that the economic harm Airbnb caused to long-term renters by reducing the housing supply and raising prices outweighed the benefits to travelers and property owners.

State lawmakers elsewhere continue to wrestle with the issue. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis a Democrat has endorsed efforts to tax short-term rentals the same as hotels. A bill is up for consideration in 2024. A measure in Arkansas to prohibit cities from enacting regulations on short-term rentals failed; a bill in Hawaii that would have allowed any county to phase out legal short-term rentals died in committee.

In past years though some state legislatures have protected Airbnb and property owners by forbidding certain city or county regulations. Arizona Florida Idaho Indiana Nebraska and Tennessee prohibit local governments from banning short-term rentals altogether.

The impact of Arizona’s 2016 law according to Tom Savage legislative director for the League of Arizona Cities and Towns is an influx of short-term rentals in the state’s tourism communities. Some are run by investment companies rather than mom-and-pops.

“This issue strains available housing stock and forces residents to nearby communities to find affordable housing” Savage said.

In three California cities with a large share of short-term rentals — Los Angeles San Francisco and San Diego — home-sharing ordinances have prohibited any listing of a short-term rental without a valid home-sharing registration number and have reduced the duration of an allowable “short-term” stay. Unlike NYC’s ordinance the California home-sharing ordinances don’t impose guest restrictions or require hosts to be onsite during stays.

Nationally there’s a shortage of 7.3 million rental homes deemed affordable and available to renters with extremely low incomes according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

“In the context of the housing crisis especially in these big cities like New York San Francisco or Austin [Texas] there’s a demand to regulate these short-term rental platforms and possibly find a way to make these units available” said González of the Urban Institute.

“So there will be cities looking at how New York City’s ban is successful in not only controlling this market but reaching those goals in terms of affordability and availability.”

Legal challenges

If cities are to follow New York City’s crackdown they’ll need to clear their first hurdle: legal challenges. When Local Law 18 passed in January 2022 Airbnb sued to block the ordinance. Its lawsuit was dismissed in August with a court arguing that Airbnb’s disagreement with city policy wasn’t a reason to block the law. That paved the way for registration and enforcement to take effect in September.

In her ruling New York state Supreme Court Justice Arlene P. Bluth argued that the city’s regulations give Airbnb “a very simple way” to ensure it’s not profiting off of unlawful activity.

Data from Airbnb watchdog group Inside Airbnb shows that there were 21785 short-term rentals in New York City as of August. That number dwindled to 6841 by the start of September as unregistered and illegal rentals began to vanish.

Dallas and New Orleans have tried to use zoning restrictions to curb short-term rentals such as by prohibiting them in residential areas but the policies have been challenged in court delaying their effect.

In some cases courts have agreed with property owners and pro-short-term rental groups.

A federal judge this summer ruled a 2016 Austin ordinance that would have prohibited people from operating rentals if they don’t live on the property to be unconstitutional. Earlier this year a Clark County Nevada district judge declared a county ordinance that in part mandated owner occupancy and distance among short-term rental properties to be unconstitutionally vague.

‘Short-term rentals are here to stay’

Policy experts say short-term rentals are here to stay as travelers’ habits have shifted toward those accommodations.

A report by AirDNA group a company that provides analytics for the short-term rental industry shows that short-term rental supply and demand is outpacing hotels a trend that could continue in 2024 in spite of regulations.

I feel like the city is scapegoating us as a reason for their poor handling of this housing crisis. People can’t afford to live here because of the city and their inability to rein in the real estate bozos. Not because of my short-term rental. – Joseph Bruno New York City Airbnb host

Advocates for short-term rentals say that even the most restrictive bans won’t guarantee that former Airbnb or Vrbo hosts will offer the spaces for long-term leasing.

In Dallas Dave Krauss has been hosting a bed-and-breakfast lodging since 2013 and thinks that compliant hosts and short-term rentals add value to the city.

Krauss and his organization Rent Responsibly work to keep short-term rentals in compliance with local regulations. For Krauss ordinances that incentivize and provide legal pathways for short-term rentals are a good policy. But the line between management and banishment of short-term rentals will create unintended consequences for the market and the city he said.

“Regulations need to be living documents that are thoughtful iterative revisited and ultimately adapted to how this market progresses and the new technologies and new” said Krauss. “A ban creates a tricky situation that causes activity to go underground. Short-term rentals are here to stay and I think cities can do more to work with good actors rather than impose bans that hurt everyone.”

In New York City Long Island native Joseph Bruno has hosted more than 200 people in his Upper West Side apartment since August 2020 after he listed it on Airbnb as a way to bring in more income. Despite the city’s ban he said he’s not going to stop finding ways to promote his apartment as a short-term rental. He won’t turn it over for a long-term tenant.

“I feel like the city is scapegoating us as a reason for their poor handling of this housing crisis” said Bruno. “People can’t afford to live here because of the city and their inability to rein in the real estate bozos. Not because of my short-term rental.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMDEvYWlyYm5iLWxhd3N1aXQtaW4tbmV3LXlvcmstZXhwb3Nlcy1mYWtlLWxpc3RpbmdzLWlzc3VlL9IBWGh0dHBzOi8vc2tpZnQuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMDEvYWlyYm5iLWxhd3N1aXQtaW4tbmV3LXlvcmstZXhwb3Nlcy1mYWtlLWxpc3RpbmdzLWlzc3VlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airbnb Lawsuit in New York Exposes Fake Listings Issue,"Verifying listings has not been a top priority for Airbnb over the years. But trying to root out fake listings through verification measures is high on the agenda for 2024. The effort would leak into 2025 at a minimum.

Airbnb has a fake listings and verification problem — and the company knows it.

While Airbnb has verified many hosts in recent years that doesn’t always mean its listings accurately represent the property the guest is trying to book.

Airbnb said in September that in late 2023 it would begin to verify every listing in its top five countries namely the U.S. Canada Australia the UK and France. Verified listings backed by such things as exterior and interior photos that match the listing or videos with the host onsite would appear with an icon starting in February 2024.

Airbnb removed around 59000 fake listings in 2023 and blocked another 157000 from ever appearing on the platform the company said.

New York City Lawsuit Against Airbnb and a Tenant

The issue came to the fore in an ongoing New York court case where a landlord sued Airbnb and a tenant for allegedly renting an apartment to guests as a short-term rental even though the building was registered with New York City as one that prohibits such use.

Airbnb acknowledges that it published two listings from a verified host “Sarah.” As shown in court filings one was for 27 Columbus Circle (seen immediately below) which the city’s Office of Special Enforcement confirmed was exempt from the Local Law 18 registration requirements.

However Airbnb also published a second listing (see below) from “Sarah” with identical photos to the first listing but it was for another address: 207 Columbus Drive 10 blocks from Columbus Circle. And it was in a building that had signed onto the city’s list that prohibits short-term rentals.

In a court hearing in late November an attorney for Airbnb Dana Brusca of the law firm ZwillGen said the host defrauded Airbnb by misrepresenting the listing’s address.

“Sarah” is not an Airbnb co-defendant in the lawsuit which was brought by Columbus 69th LLC which manages the 207 Columbus Avenue building. The co-defendant is Carmen De Dominguez allegedly the tenant who may have listed and rented out the apartment in question.

‘Where Is the Tenant? Nobody Knows’

Airbnb attorney Brusca claimed Airbnb doesn’t really have a handle on who rented out the apartment. The tenant would have been in violation of her apartment lease which bars using apartments for short-term rentals.

“Where is the tenant?” the attorney for Airbnb asked in court. “Nobody knows. We don’t know if it’s Sarah the host. We don’t know if it’s somebody else. The defendant in this case is Carmen De Dominguez. The host of Airbnb is Sarah a third-party who may or may not be before this court in any respect.”

Dominguez actually lives in the Bronx where she runs a business WID Realty Corp. according to plaintiff attorney Michael Pensabene of the firm Rosenberg & Estis’ arguments in court. Dominguez is accused in a similar matter in another legal proceeding he said.

Airbnb Removed the Offending Listing

Airbnb said it removed the 207 Columbus Avenue listing in early October when it became aware of the alleged fraud and fake listing.

But plaintiff attorney Pensabene isn’t buying the argument.

“At some point Airbnb had to become aware of the actual address being 207 because it needs to connect the guest with the host and Airbnb would not let that information go around it because then it would be cut out of the transaction and proceeds” Pensabene told Skift Friday. “That argument does not seem credible.”

The Office of Special Enforcement’s verification system is geared to determine whether a host is registered with the city or whether the property is exempt from registration requirements for reasons including being classified as a hotel. Airbnb claims it used that system to verify that 27 Columbus Circle was exempt from the registration requirement but the host fraudulently rented out another apartment 207 Columbus Avenue which was prohibited from being used as a short-term rental.

Airbnb subsequently barred the host “Sarah” from doing business on Airbnb.

But attorney Pensabene argued in court that Airbnb didn’t do enough to prevent the flouting of New York City’s short-term rental laws.

“I would suggest to Your Honor that the obligation of Local Law 18 to verify the address [207 Columbus Avenue] would have required Airbnb to verify the same person Sarah who’s now coincidentally

advertising 27 Columbus Circle” Pensabene said. “What if anything did they do to verify that address? What if anything did Airbnb do to police this same host Sarah from advertising?”

Airbnb didn’t comment to Skift about the New York lawsuit Columbus 69th LLC against Carmen De Dominguez and Airbnb but offered its plans on verifying listings starting late this year.

Are Fake Listings the Cost of Doing Business?

Airbnb announced in 2019 that it would seek to verify its listings but Covid 19 seemingly delayed those plans until recently.

This issue of course is an industrywide problem and not just Airbnb’s.

Carl Shepherd HomeAway Co-Founder

HomeAway (now known as Vrbo) co-founder Carl Shepherd said fake listings has been a persistent problem. “Crooks only have to get one listing live” Shepherd said. “Airbnb and Vrbo and Booking have to try to keep all fake listings out. It’s a continuing problem.”

Shepherd argued that most short-term rental companies see fake listings as part of the ecosystem.

“I think most of the online marketplaces look at it this way: If they protect the traveler from losses then the occasional fake listing is just the cost of doing business” Shepherd said. “But that does not help the traveler who shows up and finds that — oops — his is the host who slipped through the cracks and his trip is significantly harmed. He may get his money back but the stress of finding another place is real.”

Merillee Karr CEO UnderTheDoorMat Group

Marilee Karr the chairperson of the UK Short Term Accommodation Association and CEO of UnderTheDoorMat Group said if consumers want to avoid the risks of renting from an individual host they should look to professional property managers who can verify listings.

Karr backs third-party verification so hosts and companies can earn and display their legitimacy.

Referring to the New York court case Karr said: “I suspect in this instance Airbnb lawyers are correct that the host did post fraudulent information. Ultimately these cases are rare (although very unpleasant of course for the guest) and that is why Airbnb and other booking platforms like Booking.com and Expedia are such a global success.”

Andrew McConnell GM Revenue Management TravelNet Solutions

Andrew McConnell who general manager revenue management for TravelNet Solutions which provides tech solutions to property managers said reading guest reviews for a property would be a hedge against listings that come up short of what was advertised.

“I don’t know how knowing or not it is from Airbnb’s side but the more listings there are the more they make” McConnell said. “Hard to think they would invest as much in detecting ‘illegal listings’ as they would into increasing conversion.”

Simon Lehmann CEO of AJL Atelier

Simon Lehmann former chairman of Vacasa Europe and co-founder and CEO of AJL Atelier a vacation rental consultancy said “ensuring the accuracy and legitimacy of listings is essential.”

Said Lehmann: “Airbnb and similar platforms should take responsibility for the accuracy of the information on their platform. This includes conducting regular audits of listings and hosts to ensure compliance with their policies and local regulations.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy93aHktYWlyYm5iLWFibmItc3RvY2stdHJhZGluZy0xODQ3MzI3MzIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Airbnb (ABNB) Stock Is Trading Up Today,"Why Airbnb (ABNB) Stock Is Trading Up Today

What Happened:

Shares of online accommodations platform Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) jumped 5.8% in the afternoon session after stocks rallied as traders continued to expect more accommodating policy decisions from the Fed in the coming months. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a speech ""It would be premature to conclude with confidence that we have achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance or to speculate on when policy might ease..."" However the market seems to be shrugging off these comments for now despite them coming from the Fed Chair. The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to combat inflation and the latest data showed that their efforts may be paying off. As a result there seems to be increased optimism in the market that because inflation is stabilizing interest rates could stabilize or even move lower. As a reminder lower rates are good for stock valuations especially for tech companies where the market needs to discount back cash flows further out in the future. When the math is done to discount these cash flows back to today a lower assumed discount rate leads to higher present values.

What is the market telling us:

Airbnb's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 18 moves greater than 5%. In context of that today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.

The previous big move we wrote about was 17 days ago when the company gained 5.3% on the news that the latest inflation data from the Bureau of Statistics revealed that US consumer prices rose 3.2% in October slightly better than the expected 3.3%. That's down from 3.7% in September and a peak of 9.1% in June of last year. Additionally key categories such as food at home electricity and gasoline rose even less than the headline 3.2%. In fact gas prices decreased year on year. This suggests that inflation is gradually easing which is positive news for investors and consumers.

The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to combat inflation and the latest data indicates that their efforts may be paying off. However inflation is still above the Fed's target of 2%. Regardless the lower-than-expected inflation numbers could give the Fed more room to keep rates lower. As a reminder lower rates are a tailwind for stock valuations especially tech companies where the market needs to discount back cash flows further out in the future.

In addition to the macro tailwinds the company announced the acquisition of AI startup Gameplanner.AI. According to CNBC citing unnamed sources the deal is valued at just under $200 million. Gameplanner.AI was cofounded by Adam Cheyer one of the founders of Siri.This could prove to be a helpful and long-term positive acquisition because because AI could improve discovery on the platform leading to a better customer experience. for example hotels have a limited number of room types/sizes/layouts. ABNB listings are all different with associated reviews. AI and LLM could help users better surface what they like and what they are looking for.

Airbnb is up 56.9% since the beginning of the year but at $133.09 per share it is still trading 13.2% below its 52-week high of $153.33 from July 2023. Investors who bought $1000 worth of Airbnb's shares at the IPO in December 2020 would now be looking at an investment worth $920.25.

The Los Angeles City Council on Friday approved an ordinance requiring hotels and short term rentals like those offered through AirBnb to obtain a police permit in order to operate.

Under the new ordinance short term rental owners will have to submit information such as business and tax details and building and safety information to Los Angeles police to obtain a permit. Owners will also have to divulge any previous criminal history.

Proponents say the requirement will help the city better manage short term rentals and address public safety concerns over rental party houses human trafficking drug sales and prostitution. But opponents including the Los Angeles Police Commission small businesses and some hotel owners say the permits will be too onerous.

To that end Councilmember Marqueece Harris-Dawson requested a report within 45 days from the city attorney housing and planning departments on an alternative to the police permit.

Issues with the police permit process

According to a report by the police commission the new law is expected to push the current annual batch of about 5000 permits to 14000.

“Current staffing is insufficient to handle this additional burden” the report states.

Ray Patel of the Northeast Los Angeles Hotel Owners also called the language regarding the requirements “vague.”

“The police department or the police commission can make those requirements up as time goes along” he said. The ordinance he added puts the onus on the hotel owner for violations by a guest.

“What does the city do with a big building or even a limited service small building sitting in the middle of the town that is empty that can no longer operate as a hotel?” Patel said. “And from the owner's perspective you know if they had a loan on their mortgage well how are they going to pay that loan down now?”

Ed Colman a 71-year-old who’s been an Airbnb short term rental host for nine years said the police permitting process is unfair and would add “a whole other layer of bureaucracy.”

“I'm not open to the public. I'm not a hotel. I'm not like a hotel” Colman said. “No one can walk off the street and rent the room in my home. It's by invitation only. These are our private residences by law. That's what the Home Sharing Ordinance states.”

Under the city’s Home-Sharing Ordinance  hosts have to submit a federal or state issued ID plus two forms of documentation showing that the home they want to rent out is their primary residence. Some of the criteria to get a permit also include no pending citations from law enforcement or city agencies. The permitting process also states that “hosts must not engage in any commercial uses for purposes of a party or an event.”

Colman said adding a police permit requirement to the list will just squeeze him even more.

“I've been living in this home for 40 years and I depend on the income from my guest room to allow me to remain in my home” he said.

Heather Carson co-founder of the Homeshare Alliance Los Angeles said the city is already behind in issuing permits under Home Sharing Ordinance.

“The idea of adding an additional permit makes absolutely no sense when they can't even process the current permits properly” she added.

The city council voted unanimously earlier in the week to move the proposal forward with the addendum even though some members expressed concerns.

Councilmember Eunisses Hernandez said during a hearing on Tuesday that police permits work for some businesses that serve hundreds of people on a daily basis but those aren’t the same as something like an Airbnb “where someone would sleep for a couple of nights.”

And Councilmember John Lee who echoed the concerns of the Asian American Hotel Association said he thought the process of developing the ordinance had moved too quickly.

“Stakeholders have not been aware of this proposed expansion of the police permitting process until a few weeks ago” he said.



How the police permit came about

The new ordinance was part of a deal that the city council struck with the local union  Unite Here Local 11 last month. Under the proposal new hotel developers would be required to replace any housing that is demolished during construction either by buying new housing or constructing new projects. Also included in the deal were provisions “to address nuisance hotels and prevent the use of short-term rentals as ‘party houses’” according to council president Paul Krekorian’s office.

“We need hotels to welcome the thousands of visitors we receive but new hotel construction cannot come at the cost of our current housing stock” Krekorian said. “Irresponsible hotel and short-term rental operators cannot be allowed to endanger the public safety or impair the quality of life in our neighborhoods.”

The new deal between the council and the union is meant to replace a March 2024 ballot measure that would have required hotels to have vacant rooms made available for unhoused people.

Kurt Petersen co-president of Unite Here Local 11 said the ballot measure was born out of members’ “inability to pay rent.”

“This replacement ordinance will replace that housing one for one at the same affordability levels which means that no more housing will be displaced by luxury hotel developments” he said. “And that's a major gain not just for our members obviously but for all Angelenos.”

The police permit requirement for short term rentals and hotel owners Petersen said was included “to curb the abuse of Airbnb and others in taking housing that's meant to be for residents and illegally converting it into hotels.”

The series was available on illicit websites and other digital mediums on the internet even before the original content was made available.

The online TV and movie revenue lost to piracy in India is expected to reach USD 3.08 billion by 2022. This is a development we’ve seen not just India; revenue losses and lost monetisation opportunities by virtue of content theft and piracy continue to plague the global media & entertainment industry today. The cost of global online streaming piracy will hit $52 billion by the year 2022 according to a report by Digital TV Research. Nearly 190-billion visits were made to illegal piracy websites in 2018 of which 17.4 Billion were from the US followed by the Russian Federation (14.5 Billion) Brazil (10.3 Billion); with India (9.6 Billion) and the United Kingdom (5.75 Billion) as the other top nations affected by online piracy. In terms of the type of content pirated almost 50 percent of the visits to pirated websites were for television shows and 20 percent of visitors were looking for the latest movies.

The widespread availability of online video content instigated by factors like ubiquitous high-speed data connectivity hyper-connected devices and living room experiences - are all playing their part in the explosion of video content consumption online making it lucrative for pirates to steal a portion of the pie. As more and more viewers are moving to mediums and platforms that are digitally native circumvention of subscriptions and geo-based restrictions to access premium content with no loss in experience or quality motivates end-users to embrace pirated means of consuming content.

There are multiple ways in which digital content piracy exists today. There might be genuine users who are paying for the content but start sharing their credentials with other users. Pirate sites might sign up with content providers in a single-user model but then start re-distributing content. There are sophisticated piracy tools like re-encoders or stream ripping tools being used to grab content and redistribute it. Another popular content piracy technique is circumventing geo-restriction by using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and proxy servers to mask unauthorized IP addresses to make it look like an authorized IP which might lead to media companies breaching contractual obligations with their rights' holders due to content viewership from unauthorised regions.

According to a survey of almost 200 media technology influencers and decision-makers conducted by Akamai in 2018 attacks on media organisations are widespread and of different types. Service downtime caused by DNS based attacks or DDoS attacks were listed as an important area of concern the second most important was protecting premium video content.

For media & entertainment organisations monetising premium video content and protecting it against unauthorised usage and distribution is key to a successful video strategy. Based on the survey organisations face a few challenges in implementing technologies to prevent content piracy.

The Akamai content protection portfolio is designed in a way to help media organisations defend themselves against critical threat vectors so that organisations can focus on their core which is creating and managing content; while offloading content distribution and the threats related to safeguarding it. The portfolio aims at helping organisations prevent content piracy unauthorised access and maximise monetisation opportunities. The portfolio provides a few key capabilities including user authentication access revocation geo-restrictions encryption watermarking and securing last mile delivery using Standard TLS.

Security in the media & entertainment industry means securing the entire content delivery path from the content provider to the viewer – adopting a holistic approach to security. Any media company that wants to serve or distribute its content to these end-users or viewers needs to protect itself from attacks that can originate at multiple points across the content delivery path. Content consumption has changed over the last few years and in that it has shaped the next wave of technology and how we interact with it.

Or follow us on Google News

Thanks to a variety of factors lithium-ion battery packs are at record low prices. After dropping 14% they are down to $139/kWh. The steep price drop and record low average price come on the heels of price increases in 2022 that had brought battery prices back to 2020 levels. The world changes fast.

Just looking at EV lithium-ion batteries the average price for packs was down to $128/kWh and for cells it was down to $89/kWh.

Production vs. Demand

The figures come from a global analysis by BloombergNEF (BNEF). The reasons for the fast price change are basic economics. Battery pack production increased and battery demand was somewhat lower than expectations leading to a supply-and-demand imbalance that brought prices down. BNEF emphasizes that it wasn’t just the end production of battery packs that was up but also production capacity for raw materials and components all across the value chain for batteries.

Of course EV sales are up massively year over year. It’s just that many in the industry expected somewhat faster growth. As is always the case with fast-growing industries it’s tough trying to perfectly forecast growth in demand and time production increases in an ideal way. But it’s also that push and pull and resulting price changes that sometimes stir up faster change.

“The analysis indicates that battery demand across electric vehicles and stationary energy storage is still on track to grow at a remarkable pace of 53% year-on-year reaching 950 gigawatt-hours in 2023. Despite this growth major battery manufacturers reported lower utilization rates for their plants while demand and revenue fell short of many companies’ expectations. As a result many EV and battery makers revisited their production targets which in turn impacted battery prices. Lithium prices reached a high point at the end of 2022 but fears that prices would remain high have largely subsided since then and prices are now falling again” BNEF writes.

“The figures represent an average across multiple battery end-uses including different types of electric vehicles buses and stationary storage projects. For battery electric vehicle (BEV) packs prices were $128/kWh on a volume-weighted average basis in 2023. At the cell level average prices for BEVs were just $89/kWh. This indicates that on average cells account for 78% of the total pack price. Over the last four years the cell-to-pack cost ratio has risen from the traditional 70:30 split. This is partially due to changes to pack design such as the introduction of cell-to-pack approaches which have helped reduce costs.”

China vs. US vs. Europe

Unsurprisingly average battery pack prices were lower in China ($126/kWh) than in the US or Europe. “Packs in the US and Europe were 11% and 20% higher respectively. Higher prices reflect the relative immaturity of these markets higher production costs lower volumes and the diverse range of applications. There was also intense price competition domestically in China this year as battery manufacturers ramped up production capacity aiming to grab a share of the growing battery demand.”

Europe and the US should see easier price drops as production ramps up more in those markets.

March Into Lithium-Iron-Phosphate Batteries

As we’ve been documenting for years the electric vehicle industry has shifted more and more to low-cost lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries — which don’t have as strong of performance as some other EV battery chemistries but which have gotten good enough energy density and power density at low cost to be the most competitive options in many markets.

“These packs and cells had the lowest global weighted-average prices at $130/kWh and $95/kWh respectively. This is the first year that BNEF’s analysis found LFP average cell prices falling below $100/kWh. On average LFP cells were 32% cheaper than lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (NMC) cells in 2023” BNEF writes.

Forecast: Record Low Battery Prices Again In 2024 2025 & Beyond

Naturally the forecast is that the learning curve continues economies of scale grow R&D pays off and lithium-ion battery prices continue to drop. BNEF is expecting record low prices again in 2024 and then record low prices in 2025 and so on and so on. In particular in 2023 dollars BNEF is projecting the following battery pack price averages:

$133/kWh in 2024

$113/kWh in 2025

$80/kWh in 2030

At 57.5% the cost of batteries in 2023 one would expect hyper-competitive EV prices in 2030. Disruption mode. And recall that Europe is already at 23% plugin vehicle share (16% BEV share) China is already at 36% plugin vehicle share (24% BEV share) and the world is at 17% plugin vehicle share (12% BEV share). Where will we be in 2030?

Here are some final words from Yayoi Sekine head of energy storage at BNEF: “Battery prices have been on a rollercoaster over the past two years. Large markets like the US and Europe are building up their local cell manufacturing and we’re keenly watching how production incentives and tightening regulations on critical minerals will impact battery prices. These localization efforts will add a layer of complexity to how battery prices shape up regionally in coming years.”

It may not be anywhere close to the sales of EV giants BYD and Tesla but it’s growing. Its November sales were up 12.6% and its sales throughout the first 11 months of the year were up 33.1%.

In volume terms NIO had 15959 sales in November and 142026 sales from January through November. The company is approaching half a million cumulative sales sitting at 431582 at the moment.

NIO’s November sales were slightly down compared to October but they have been more or less stable for the past three months.

In more positive news following an announcement that Changan is now partnering with NIO on battery swapping we also just got an announcement that Geely is partnering with NIO on battery swapping. “Both parties agreed to carry out comprehensive cooperation on battery standards battery swapping technology battery swapping network expansion and operation swappable model development and battery asset management” NIO writes. “The partnership in line with China’s development direction of new infrastructure and new energy will further standardize battery swapping technology increase the scale of the battery swap network and accelerate the low-carbon transformation of the automotive industry.”

“NIO and Geely share a profound understanding of battery swapping and have been dedicated to the investment in the battery swapping technology and network for private cars and commercial vehicles with rich experience in swapping service and operations” said William LI Founder Chairman and CEO of NIO “As a leading company in the Chinese automotive market Geely Holding’s rapid development in the new energy field is impressive. This strategic partnership will further popularize battery swapping bring quality and convenient battery swapping experience to more users and contribute to the steady development of the smart EV industry. We will continue to advance the construction of battery swapping network for NIO users and improve the users’ experience while collaborating with partners to launch the construction of shared battery swapping network.”

“Green sustainable development and carbon neutrality have become a global consensus” said Eric LI Founder and Chairman of Geely Holding “As one of the most innovative methods for recharging electric vehicles the future development of battery swapping technology requires the joint efforts of all parties in the industry to advance it. Geely’s Yiyi Power has already achieved good results in many cities and continues to expand across the country. Through this strategic cooperation in battery swapping the two parties will strengthen their cooperation in the battery swapping industry chain accelerate the adoption of unified standards expand the ecosystem for battery swapping and charging support the low-carbon transformation and high-quality development of the automotive industry and offer a better electric mobility experience for users.”

Sounds good.

Or follow us on Google News

XPeng has had its ups and downs in the past couple of years but I continue to think that it’s got some of the best electric cars in the world and some of the best tech in the world. Value for the money XPeng can compete with anyone in the classes it sells in.

XPeng delivered 20041 “smart” electric vehicles in November. That’s an increase of 245% over its November 2022 total. It’s also the second month that XPeng went beyond 20000 sales. Extrapolating that kind of monthly output puts XPeng on track for nearly a quarter-million sales a year.

Though XPeng’s year-to-date total was just 121486 at the end of November because the company has grown month after month after month all year long. Every month for the past 10 months has seen higher sales than the month before.

XPeng’s G6 was a big part of the company’s success in November. “XPENG G6’s November deliveries reached 8750 units remaining the top-selling electric SUV model in the RMB200000-250000 price range.”

It’s now got another new model on the market just unveiled in the middle of November that aims to reap the rewards of all of XPeng’s tech innovation the X9. Read more about it here or see what Jo Borras and I have to say about it here:

Or really just look at the pictures:

XPeng also recently provided over-the-air updates for its vehicle owners. “On November 28 2023 XPENG brought G9 G6 and P7i owners an even more advanced driving experience with the latest OTA updates delivered through its smart cockpit operating system Xmart OS 4.4.0. As China’s first automaker to bring drivers mass-produced high-level ADAS for urban areas XPENG has once again pioneered the domestic EV industry with the latest OTA update of its next-gen XNGP ADAS that operates independently of HD map coverage in urban areas — a feature now available in more than 20 cities across China. This marks a giant leap forward for XNGP ADAS technology placing XPENG ahead of the industry curve.” XPeng may well be the world leader in terms of ADAS functionality and performance. But of course it is just focused on the Chinese market for now.

Clearly XPeng is on the upswing again. What will December bring? How long will the company’s growth streak run? How many people will jump in and buy the X9 high-tech futuristic luxury minivan? Will XPeng ever bring that wicked 7-seater to the US or Europe where it seems it would raise the bar in this category and potentially expand the market considerably? We’ll see.

ARE,Alexandria Real Estate Equities,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hbGV4YW5kcmlhLXJpc2VzLTEyLW1vbnRoLXRyZW5kLTE1MDUwMDkwOS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alexandria (ARE) Rises 12% in a Month: Will the Trend Last?,"Shares of Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. ARE have rallied 11.8% over the past month compared with the industry's growth of 7.5%.



Alexandria owns Class A/A+ properties in the AAA innovation cluster locations of North America with significant market presence in Greater Boston San Francisco Bay Area New York City San Diego Seattle Maryland and the Research Triangle.



These locations are highly appealing to life science agtech and technology companies seeking tenancy. Moreover they are characterized by high barriers to entry for new landlords high barriers to exit for tenants and a limited supply of available space.

Zacks Investment Research

Given the booming demand for life-science assets on the back of the increasing need for drug research and innovation the company continues to witness healthy demand and maintain high occupancy levels.

In the third quarter total leasing activity aggregated 867582 RSF of space of which lease renewals and re-leasing of space amounted to 396334 RSF. Rental rate growth was 28.8% or 19.7% on a cash basis.



The occupancy of operating properties in North America remained high at 93.7% as of Sep 30 2023. For 2023 we expect Alexandria’s same-store occupancy to be 94.1%



With artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools being implemented in this industry AI-focused life science companies require a significant lab footprint to generate the immense biological and chemical datasets needed to train AI-ML models effectively. This is likely to emerge as a key demand driver for Alexandria’s life-science assets in the upcoming period.



Alexandria enjoys a solid tenant base of around 825 diversified high-quality companies ranging from multinational pharmaceutical companies public and private biotechnology companies manufacturers of complex medicines and top-tier investment-grade companies and institutions as well as technology entities.



These tenants mainly rely on a central lab-based infrastructure to optimize their research capabilities and workflow making it difficult for them to switch locations frequently. Notably in the last 12 months 80% of ARE’s leasing activity was generated from its existing client base.



As a result the company is generally able to command high rents at its properties aiding steady revenues over the long term. We estimate rental income to increase 9.5% on a year-over-year basis in 2023.



Alexandria’s acquisition development and redevelopment of new Class A/A+ properties in AAA locations to enhance its operating platform bode well for long-term growth. Its pipeline of current and near-term projects is expected to generate annual incremental net operating income of $580 million through the third quarter of 2026 which is encouraging.



In addition as part of the company’s capital-recycling efforts it aims to achieve dispositions and sales of partial interests target of $1.65 billion in 2023 and is well on track.



The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company maintains a robust balance sheet position supporting its growth endeavors. This has enabled it to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities. It exited the third quarter of 2023 with $6.9 billion of liquidity. It has no debt maturities prior to 2025 and its weighted-average remaining term was 13.1 years.



Moreover in September and October 2023 ARE received reaffirmations on its credit ratings of Baa1/Stable and BBB+/Positive from Moody’s and S&P Global Ratings respectively. This renders access to the debt market at favorable costs.



For 2023 expecting to benefit from the flourishing life-science market the company revised its 2023 guidance for AFFO per share to $8.97-$8.99 from $8.93-$8.99 estimated earlier representing a 2-cent increase at the midpoint to $8.98. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $8.97 within expectations.



Nonetheless Alexandria’s substantial active development and redevelopment pipeline although encouraging for long-term growth increases the risks related to cost overruns and lease-up concerns amid the current macroeconomic scenario and a high interest rate environment.



Further with high interest rates in place the company may find it difficult to purchase or develop real estate with borrowed funds as the costs are likely to be on the higher side.

Big vision-language models or LVLMs can interpret visual cues and provide easy replies for users to interact with. This is accomplished by skillfully fusing large language models (LLMs) with large-scale visual instruction finetuning. Nevertheless LVLMs only need hand-crafted or LLM-generated datasets for alignment by supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Although it works well to change LVLMs from caption generators to models that obey instructions LVLMs can still produce replies that are hurtful ill-intentioned or useless. This suggests that they still need to be more aligned with human preferences. Furthermore while previous research encourages the organization of visual instruction tuning samples in multi-turn forms the LVLMs’ capacity to interact is limited by the weak connections and interdependence between different turns. Here the interaction ability assesses how well LVLMs can adjust their replies using the prior context in multi-turn interactions. These two drawbacks limit the practical use of LVLMs as visual helpers.

The research team from SRI International and the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign presents DRESS an LVLM that is uniquely taught using Natural Language Feedback (NLF) produced by LLMs in this work (refer to Figure 1). The research team instructs LLMs to provide fine-grained feedback on the LVLM’s replies by providing them with specific rules and extensive photo annotation. In keeping with the process of creating human-aligned LLMs this feedback annotation considers the three H criteria: helpfulness honesty and harmlessness. The feedback measures the replies’ overall quality along the 3H criteria and provides a numerical score and NLF. The research team’s method divides NLF into critique and refining. This is a novel classification. While the refinement NLF offers precise recommendations to LVLMs on improving their replies to align with the ground truth reference the critique NLF evaluates the responses’ strengths and faults. This classification provides a natural application of two kinds of NLF to make LVLMs more palatable to humans and enhance their interaction capabilities.

Figure 1: Researchers direct DRESS to use natural language input which is divided into two categories critique and refinement to enhance both alignment with human preferences and interaction capacity.

The research team generalizes the conditional reinforcement learning technique to meet the non-differentiable character of NLF and trains the LVLMs with such feedback. Specifically the research team uses linguistic modeling (LM) loss on the replies to train DRESS to generate equivalent responses conditioned on the two NLFs. The research team refines DRESS by analyzing and interpreting the numerical results to match user preferences better. Through multi-turn interactions during inference the research team trains DRESS to learn the meta-skill of refining its original replies by employing refinement NLF.

The research team assesses DRESS on multi-turn interactions adversarial prompting for harmlessness assessment picture captioning for honesty assessment and open-ended visual question responding for helpfulness evaluation. The experiments’ findings show that compared to earlier LVLMs DRESS can provide replies that align with human values and have superior interaction capabilities that allow it to learn from feedback and modify responses as needed efficiently. To their knowledge the research team’s effort is the first to address the interaction ability and all three 3H criteria for LVLMs.

The research team’s contributions are summed up as follows:

• The research team suggests using natural language feedback (NLF) which may be divided into critique and refining NLF to enhance LVLMs’ ability to interact and align with human preferences.

• By training the model to provide matching responses conditioned on the NLF the research team generalizes the conditional reinforcement learning method to accommodate the non-differentiable NLF successfully. Compared to the previous SOTA the research team’s suggested model DRESS demonstrates relative improvements of 9.76% 11.52% and 21.03% based on a systematic evaluation of helpfulness honesty and harmlessness alignment.

• The research group generates and makes 63K annotated language NLF examples available for public use including 3H characteristics. Furthermore the research team created a publicly available dataset of 4.7K samples for harmlessness alignment and LVLM assessment.

Or follow us on Google News

Carbon dioxide reaches a liquid state when compressed and it expands with a pop when released and now the Italian startup Energy Dome is ready to harness the action for a new energy storage system that could provide far more storage at far less cost than conventional lithium-ion battery arrays. Energy Dome’s first project is getting under way in Italy with completion expected before the end of next year. A second project is already in the pipeline for the US state of Wisconsin too.

CO2 For Long Duration Energy Storage

With the climate crisis looming overhead long duration energy storage systems have been described as the key to unlocking vast reserves of intermittent wind and solar energy at a more rapid pace.

Lithium-ion battery arrays are currently the go-to medium for storing excess wind and solar energy. However the state of battery technology typically allows for about 4-6 hours of storage with newer systems topping out at eight hours. That’s enough to accomplish daily grid management tasks but the work will pile up as higher volumes of renewable energy flow into grid systems. For future grid resiliency energy planners are seeking a minimum of 10 hours in storage capacity ideally reaching a full day or much longer.

The idea of using liquid CO2 for energy storage is simple enough now that low cost renewable energy is at hand. During periods when renewable energy output is high but electricity demand is low grid managers have to order curtailments in wind or solar capacity. With a CO2 storage system the excess kilowatts can be put to work running compressors that convert a large volume of CO2 gas to a smaller volume of liquid. When released from compression and heated the CO2 expands back to a gas and is put to work running turbines to generate electricity.

Energy Dome crossed the CleanTechnica radar last year with a new “CO2 Battery” storage system. The company earned a place in BNEF Pioneers program of the influential Bloomberg NEF energy research organization based on its potential for achieving long duration energy storage of up to 24 hours. The system is relatively simple deploying expandable bladders as a storage platform.

“To ice the long duration energy storage cake Energy Dome claims that its system is based on proven technologies with non-flammable non-toxic materials and that it maintains its performance level for 25 years and possibly longer” we noted.

A New CO2 Storage System For Italy

In the latest development on Friday Energy Dome announced that it has gained project-level funding to begin work on its first “thermo-mechanical energy storage system” in the municipality of Otttana in the Sardinian province of Nuoro. The euros are coming from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst (up to €35000000) and the European Investment Bank (€25000000 via Invest EU) through a partnership between Breakthrough and the EU.

“This combined investment is an endorsement of Energy Dome’s ready-to-be-deployed long-duration energy storage proposition. Energy Dome’s robust performance (high round-trip efficiency) and capital expenditure requirements are significantly more competitive than the Lithium-Ion benchmark providing a solution to the critical problem of utility-scale long-duration energy storage which is at the core of the renewable energy transition” Energy Dome states.

The Sardinia project will consist of the company’s standardized 20-megawatt 200 megawatt-hour CO2 Battery. It meets the 10-hour long duration milestone described by the US Department of Energy among others.

“The CO2 Battery does not use materials from rare metals and its main components are based on already existing and known supply chains enabling job creation within Europe” Energy Dome adds.

$30 Million For Long Duration Energy Storage In Wisconsin

Commercial operation is expected by Q3 2024 for Energy Dome’s project in Italy. Meanwhile energy planners in Wisconsin are eagerly awaiting their own 20-megawatt CO2 Battery under the forthcoming Columbia Energy Storage Project. The plan is to submit project details to state regulators next year with an eye on beginning construction in 2025 at a site in the Town of Portage.

The project will be up and running in 2026 if all goes according to plan. That may have been a somewhat dicey proposition some years ago when Wisconsin had a rocky relationship with renewable energy in general and wind power in particular. More recently though the momentum has gone to the clean tech side.

In fact Wisconsin stakeholders are anticipating that the new storage system will serve as a model for replication all around the US and some heavy hitters are involved.

The lead US stakeholder behind the CO2 Battery project is the Wisconsin public utility Alliant Energy which received a grant of up to $30 million from the US Department of Energy for the Columbia project. In addition to funding from the Energy Department partners in the project include WEC Energy Group Madison Gas and Electric Shell Global Solutions US the California-based Electric Power Research Institute University of Wisconsin-Madison and Madison College.

“Guided by our purpose-driven strategy we continue to invest in cost-effective sustainable energy solutions for the customers and communities we proudly serve” enthused John Larsen Alliant CEO and board chair. “As we diversify our energy mix the added capacity and unique capabilities of energy storage solutions will strengthen our generation portfolio increase grid resilience improve reliability and help us continue to meet customer needs.”

More Long Duration Energy Storage For The USA

As another indication that the Wisconsin project is anticipated to be the first of many it was funded through the Energy Department’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations which launched in 2021 with a $25 billion mandate from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to “help scale the emerging technologies needed to tackle our most pressing climate challenges and achieve net zero emissions by 2050.”

OCED has set a high bar for the projects in its long duration energy storage portfolio. In addition to scooping more wind and solar energy into the grid long duration projects are expected to improve critical infrastructure emergency response grid stability and management systems and transmission systems with a particular focus on rural areas including communities where energy costs are high.

Long duration energy storage is also expected to help defer or outright avoid new costs associated with transformers substations and other transmission and distribution infrastructure. Providing for EV fast-charging stations is another priority among other tasks.

On top of all that projects that qualify for OCED funding have to submit a community benefits plan. OCED lists community and workforce engagement workforce investment energy and environmental justice and diversity equity inclusion and accessibility among the elements of a qualifying project.

The Columbia project “builds on an ongoing partnership between Alliant Energy Columbia County and the Ho-Chunk Nation by supporting their shared goals of advancing sustainable energy solutions and expanding economic opportunities” OCED explained in a funding announcement issued in September.

With the artwork for the single reflecting the album artwork for Change The Game the second single release from his forthcoming album follows suit of Cody Jinks’ consistent yet pungent messaging through his lyrics. “Sober Thing” takes a much more serious and melancholy tone than his first single “Outlaws and Mustangs.”

“Sober Thing” highlights the feeling of being in a dark place near spiraling and trying to pull yourself out of the cycle of self-medicating.

“And I don’t know which ones are worse

The nightmares or the hangovers

The sleepless nights or the passin’ out and finally gettin’ rest.”

Through the lyrics you hear the struggle of wanting to give up the cycle but often finding yourself back near the bottle and starting again from square one being the “same old mess as I have always been.”

“I started in the first place

The numbin’ just fueled me for the runnin’ away from the pain

And I’m closer to the messed up than the sober thing.”

The heavy-hitting message of the song highlights a very personal message to Jinks as it reflects his journey to sobriety.

“I wrote ‘Sober Thing’ right after we finished the ‘Mercy’ album. I was giving up a twenty-plus year affair with whiskey and every word of that song is true. I don’t remember writing some of my biggest songs but I damn sure remember writing that one.”

The gentle composition of the track highlights the heavy-hitting message letting each word soak into the listeners’ ears. The primarily piano ballad also highlights gentle steel guitar licks and a soft percussion base that keeps the tempo while keeping an outlaw sound to the slower track.

We can expect to see honest and no-filtered songwriting throughout Change The Game as Jinks reflects on the lyrical messages found beyond “Sober Thing.”

“This is the most open and honest record I’ve ever recorded I laid everything out.”

Jinks is one of the best in the business for his no-bullsh*t songwriting and given these two released singles I have a feeling that Change The Game might feature some of his best yet.

Turn “Sober Thing” all the way up. It hurts so good.

Newmarket Allstate Agency employees had a shoebox stuffing party last year to help support the Shoebox Project.

1 / 1 Newmarket Allstate Agency employees had a shoebox stuffing party last year to help support the Shoebox Project. Advertisement

Each year the Newmarket Allstate Agency gets into the giving spirit of the holidays to support the Shoebox Project.

Founded in Toronto in 2011 the Shoebox Project was started by four sisters-in-law when the family noticed there were many opportunities to provide gifts to children experiencing homelessness during the holiday season but less initiatives for their mothers.

Hoping to make the holiday season brighter for women in their community they decided to ask friends and acquaintances to fill a shoebox with thoughtful and essential gifts.

Antonietta Zambri Allstate Newmarket Agency manager says supporting the initiative has been something they’ve really embraced because it brings the team together to work toward the common goal of supporting women impacted by homelessness.

Last year the agency even held a “shoebox stuffing party” to drum up more support from its staff and plan to again this year.

Newmarket Allstate takes the support a step further by using personal relationships to encourage community participation and donations toward this great cause Zambri said.

“We believe it’s not just gifts we are collecting for women facing challenges and obstacles these are reminders that they matter” she said.

As the cost of living continues to go up supporting programs like this has become increasingly important Zambri said. She noted that many women — especially women of colour LGBTQ+ individuals and women living with a disability – are disproportionately affected by homelessness.

“That’s why our agency recognizes the importance of being able to support programs like this” she said. “It can sometimes take a small gesture – like a gift-filled shoebox – to be able to make a profound impact for those who may not have much. To some it may be the only gift they receive.”

Zambri said the agency feels it has a responsibility to use its platform and resources to help advocate for those unable to advocate for themselves and support community initiatives while bringing awareness to important issues.

“Whether it is through donating items or spreading the Shoebox Project’s message by word of mouth or online if each one of us connected with our own friends and family and come together to support this initiative there’s no telling what our impact will be” she said.

Those who wish to participate can by providing a shoebox filled with $50 worth of high-quality essential everyday items and small luxuries that any woman would love. The shoeboxes can be dropped off until Dec. 15 at the Newmarket Allstate Agency 17725 Yonge St. unit 9.

Items can include things like shampoo and conditioner toothbrush and toothpaste body wash deodorant socks and gift cards. And recommended luxury items like cosmetics skin and self-care products or nut-free chocolates and candies.

Allstate and the Allstate Foundation have been supporting the program since 2015 and have collected over 9000 gift-filled shoeboxes and donated over $175000 in support of the organization.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5lc3BuLmNvbS9jb2xsZWdlLWZvb3RiYWxsL3N0b3J5L18vcGFnZS93ZWVrbHlzY2VuYXJpbzEyMDEyMy9jb2xsZWdlLWZvb3RiYWxsLXBsYXlvZmYtcHJvamVjdGlvbnMtd2Vlay0xNC1jaGFtcC13ZWVrLWdlb3JnaWEtbWljaGlnYW4td2FzaGluZ3Rvbi1mbG9yaWRhLXN0YXRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,College Football Playoff projections: Champ Week will decide,"Open Extended Reactions

If you were under the impression that Rivalry Week would somehow clear up the College Football Playoff picture you were only a week off.

With all but the top teams in each conference watching from home this weekend Champ Week is sure to settle the issue of which teams will be playing in the CFP semifinal Jan. 1.

Some scenarios are simpler than others: If all four current unbeaten teams -- Georgia Michigan Washington Florida State -- win their conference championship they've surely secured a spot in the playoff. A loss by any of them on the other hand could mean some hard decisions by the selection committee Sunday.

According to the Allstate Playoff Predictor entering conference championship weekend there are seven (seven!) teams with at least a 25% chance to reach the CFP and eight teams with at least a 5% chance.

ESPN

As much as the committee says it looks for the four ""best"" teams 32 of the 36 playoff teams in the CFP era have been in the top four of Strength of Record. Here are the current SOR rankings with Michigan now at No. 1 after beating Ohio State.

ESPN

Two shakeup scenarios

What happens in the scenario where Michigan Florida State Oregon Texas and Alabama all win?

According to the Allstate Playoff Predictor that would set up a very close battle between Texas and Alabama for the final spot (after Michigan Florida State and Oregon). In that situation the predictor gives Texas a 57% chance to reach the CFP and Alabama a 44% chance.

What if in the above scenario Georgia wins instead of Alabama? Then Georgia and Michigan would clearly take spots and the final two places would be between Florida State (92%) Oregon (85%) and Texas (23%).

Fear the Buckeyes?

Which bubble team should other playoff teams not want to get in? If we're counting the Buckeyes that's the answer: Ohio State still ranks No. 1 in FPI and would be a huge threat if it got into the playoff. But their chances are slim to earn a berth.

The other answer is Oregon which ranks third in FPI currently behind only Ohio State and Michigan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vbGFzdHdvcmRvbnNwb3J0cy5jb20vY29sbGVnZWZvb3RiYWxsLzIwMjMvMTIvMDIvdXBkYXRlZC1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtd2Vlay1ib3dsLXByb2plY3Rpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Updated Championship Week Bowl Projections - Last Word on College Football,"One Day Until The Final Picks

As promised when we last talked on Tuesday we are back with our Updated Championship Week Bowl Projections. While there were two games Friday night it was the Pac-12 title contest and the last “Pac-12 After Dark” which helped set not only our playoff teams but the selection committee games as well.

As anyone in Hollywood would tell you sequels are generally never as good as the original. For about 30 minutes it looked like the case again as Washington jumped out to a 20-3 lead. However behind Bo Nix Oregon came rallying back to take a 24-20 lead. But as they’ve done all year Michael Penix Dillon Johnson and the Huskies answered every challenge. As a result they punched their ticket to the playoff winning 34-31.

Speaking of Washington going back to the preseason Last Word had them as the three seed in the playoff. After dropping out for a few weeks they returned in Week Seven where they stayed the rest of the year. In fact we were the only site to have them in the playoff consistently. Kalen DeBoer’s squad rewarded our faith in them. Now let’s get to our picks.

College Football Playoff

We’ll start off by saying these are based on all the favorites winning Saturday. If one or more loses then chaos will ensue.

Allstate Sugar Bowl: January 1st- (1)- Georgia vs. (4)- Florida State- The Seminoles may be without quarterback Tate Rodemaker for their battle against Louisville.



Prudential Rose Bowl: January 1st- (2)- Michigan vs. (3)- Washington- The Huskies high powered offense versus the Wolverines stout defense is a must-see game.



College Football National Championship: January 8th- (1)- Georgia vs. (2)- Michigan- Our title game remains the same as the last few weeks.

Heading into our next set of match-ups ups there are pretty much the same for now.

Selection Committee Games

Goodyear Cotton Bowl: December 29th- Missouri vs. Texas- If losses by the top teams happen could the Longhorns sneak in as the fourth team?



Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl: December 30th- Tulane vs. Penn State- The Green Wave faces SMU for the AAC title later today. If Willie Fritz’s team wins then they are the Group Of Five team. Should the Mustangs win then things get interesting. It’s likely Liberty gets the nod after winning the Conference USA crown 49-35 over New Mexico State.

Capital One Orange Bowl: December 30th- Louisville vs. Ohio State– The Cards are pretty much locked into the Orange Bowl. Even if they lose to Florida State they should still be ahead of North Carolina State since they beat them earlier in the year.



VRBO Fiesta Bowl: January 1st- Oregon vs. Alabama- The team that didn’t win the Pac-12 title was slotted to go to Arizona and that’s the Ducks. On paper this should be a whale of a game.



Continuing with our Updated Championship Week Bowl Projections let’s roll through the games by date. One thing to note there are no games on December 24th or 31st to not go up against the NFL schedule.

Games Around the New Year

Cheez-It Citrus Bowl: January 1st- Big 10 vs. SEC- Ole Miss vs. Iowa

ReliaQuest Bowl: January 1st- SEC vs. Big 10- LSU vs. Notre Dame



TransPerfect Music City Bowl: December 30th- SEC vs. Big 10- Auburn vs. Wisconsin- Last week it looked like the Aggies were headed for Nashville. However it now appears the Tigers are going there.



Barstool Sports Arizona Bowl: December 30th- MAC vs. MWC– Fresno State vs. Miami (Ohio)

TaxSlayer Gator Bowl: December 29th- SEC vs. Big 10 or ACC/Notre Dame- North Carolina vs. Tennessee

Tony The Tiger Sun Bowl: December 29th- ACC/Notre Dame vs. Pac-12- Miami (Florida) vs. USC

AutoZone Liberty Bowl: December 29th- Big 12 vs. SEC- SMU* vs. Iowa State- As a result of no SEC team being available we’re sending the Mustangs to Memphis.



Post Christmas Games

Quick Lane Bowl: December 26th- Big 10 vs. MAC- Minnesota vs. Ohio



SERVPRO First Responder Bowl: December 26th- American/ACC/Big 12/ SEC- Duke vs. Kansas State



Guaranteed Rate Bowl: December 26th- Big 12 vs. Big 10- West Virginia vs. Northwestern



DirecTV Holiday Bowl: December 27th- ACC vs. Pac-12- Clemson vs. Oregon State- With D.J. Uiaglelei in the transfer portal this match-up doesn’t quite have the same excitement. However we are keeping it for now.



Military Bowl: December 27th- ACC/Notre Dame vs. American- Syracuse vs. Memphis

Duke’s Mayo Bowl: December 27th- ACC/Notre Dame vs. SEC- Kentucky vs. Virginia Tech- Barring some full-scale chaos on Saturday the Wildcats seemed locked into playing in Charlotte. Earlier in the week Duke looked like the likely opponent. However it’s looking more likely that the Hokies will be the ACC representative. This is a rematch of the then Belk Bowl in 2019 the Cats won 37-30.



TaxAct Texas Bowl: December 27th- Big 12 vs. SEC- Kansas vs. Texas A&M



Wasabi Fenway Bowl: December 28th- ACC/Notre Dame vs. American- Boston College vs. South Florida



Bad Boy Motors Pinstripe Bowl: December 28th- ACC/Notre Dame vs. Big 10- Georgia Tech vs. Rutgers

Pop Tarts Bowl- December 28th: ACC/Notre Dame vs. Big 12- North Carolina State vs. Oklahoma State



Valero Alamo Bowl: December 28th- Big 12 vs. Pac-12- Oklahoma vs. Arizona



As we roll on with our Updated Championship Week Bowl Projections let’s move to the set of games just before Christmas. That includes a whopping seven games on December 23rd. Going through our last sets of games we had to get creative with some of these games so as to not have teams from the Sun Belt playing each other.



Games Right Before Christmas

76 Birmingham Bowl December 23rd: American vs. SEC- *Liberty vs. *Troy- The game has a new sponsor and would be one of the best of the bowl season.



Camellia Bowl- December 23rd: MAC vs. Sun Belt- Bowling Green vs. Marshall



Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl: December 23rd- Big 12 vs. Pool- Air Force vs. James Madison- It looks like the Dukes have found their bowl game. However they will be without their coach Curt Cignelli who is headed to Indiana.



Famous Idaho Potato Bowl: December 23rd- MAC vs. MWC- Northern Illinois vs. Wyoming



68 Ventures Bowl: December 23rd- Pool vs. Sun Belt- Georgia Southern vs. Utah State

RS Distribution Las Vegas Bowl: December 23rd- Big 10 vs. Pac-12- Maryland vs. Utah



Easy Post Hawai’i Bowl: December 23rd- Conference USA/MWC/American- Coastal Carolina+ vs. San Jose State+- Earlier this week the Chanticleers and Spartans became the first teams to officially accept a bid.



Union Home Mortgage Gasparilla Bowl: December 22nd- American/ACC/Notre Dame/SEC- South Alabama vs. Central Florida

RoofClaim.com Boca Raton Bowl: December 21st- Group Of Five vs. Group Of Five- Old Dominion vs. New Mexico State



We wrap up our Updated Championship Week with the first set of bowls on the schedule. That includes a massive seven-game slate on December 16th alone.

First Weekend Games

Famous Toastery Bowl: December 16th- Conference USA vs. MAC- Eastern Michigan vs. Arkansas State*- The former Bahamas Bowl being played in Charlotte this year has a new sponsor.



Cricket Celebration Bowl: December 16th- MEAC vs. SWAC- Florida A&M vs. Howard+- The Bison became the first team to clinch a bowl bid by winning the MEAC.



R+L Carriers New Orleans Bowl: December 16th- Conference USA vs. Sun Belt- Louisiana+ vs. Jacksonville State+- It looks like Ticketmaster spoiled the unveiling of this contest which was found online Thursday night. Nonetheless we now know where Jacksonville State is playing in its first bowl game.



Duluth Trading Cure Bowl: December 16th- Group Of Five vs. Group Of Five- Toledo vs. Appalachian State

The fund declined by 5.8% in the third quarter which brought year-to-date (YTD) returns to 6.5% net of all fees compared to a 13.1% total return for the S&P 500 YTD and a 2.5% total return for the Russell 2000 YTD.

Atai Capital highlighted stocks like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in the Q3 2023 investor letter. Headquartered in Mountain View California Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a multinational technology company. On November 30 2023 Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock closed at $133.92 per share. One-month return of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was 2.72% and its shares gained 32.82% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has a market capitalization of $1.667 trillion.

Atai Capital made the following comment about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

""On average individual stocks experience fluctuations of around 80% in any given year. When we pause to contemplate the fact that every share represents a fractional ownership in an underlying business this notion that the fundamental value of most enterprises undergoes such substantial swings in a single year is nothing short of ludicrous. Moreover volatility also disregards price and valuation entirely. For example in theory Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) at $500 could have the same Beta (a measure of volatility) at its current price of $130. In this example it doesn't take much common sense to recognize the flaw of using volatility as a measure of risk. Google is undoubtedly a great business but at $500 it would be significantly more expensive than it is today carrying a higher level of risk and lower prospective returns. The inverse scenario is applicable here as well and If Google were to experience a swift 50% decline a professor would likely tell you it’s now riskier but I would argue that Google at $65 would represent a remarkable bargain today!""

A Google tax also known as a diverted profits tax refers to anti-tax-avoidance provisions that have been introduced in some countries. Several jurisdictions implemented the provision to stop companies from diverting profits or royalties to other jurisdictions that have lower or even zero tax rates. For example internet giant Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) Google paid a negligible amount in taxes in the United Kingdom by completing its transactions in the low-tax city of Dublin Ireland even though it earned $6.5 billion in revenue in the U.K.

Key Takeaways A Google tax is a tax on multinational companies aimed at preventing them from diverting their profits from a country where those profits were earned to one with a lower tax rate.

It is also known as a diverted profits tax.

Among the countries with a Google tax are Australia and the United Kingdom.

While Google became notorious for its tax avoidance policies other major companies such as Amazon Apple Meta and Starbucks have also used similar tactics to lower their tax obligations.

Some of the tax loopholes have since been closed including those that figured into the so-called ""double Irish Dutch sandwich"" strategy.

A number of countries have also imposed separate digital services taxes on the tech giants and efforts at a global agreement to tax them appropriately and distribute the proceeds are underway.

Understanding the Google Tax

Though the term includes the name of the company (Google) that became the poster boy for the practice diverting profits is rampant across various industry sectors. Technology giants from the U.S. like Meta formerly Facebook (META) Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Amazon Inc. (AMZN) as well as other multinational corporations like Starbucks Inc. (SBUX) and Diageo PLC (DEO) have all used such practices to lower their tax bills.

For instance a mobile app like Meta's WhatsApp messenger or a game like Clash of Clans may not have a single employee in a particular country but it can still derive a lot of profit from its local user base through online ads and in-app purchases. Companies enjoyed the freedom to account for such revenues and earnings at a destination of their choice and they often diverted it to low-cost jurisdictions as a result.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mandates that American businesses publicly report details on where and how much revenue they generate across the globe allowing the authorities of other countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia to obtain more concrete data on any possible tax avoidance measures those businesses may be using.

In the U.K. and Australia tax laws were modified to prevent companies from following such practices. Amid rising public anger the U.K. introduced a diverted profits tax in 2015 which it set at 25%. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) the U.K.'s tax collection agency secured £6.5 billion (around $8.33 billion) in additional taxes by challenging the transfer pricing arrangements of multinationals between 2012-2018. Its own figures show that it took in an extra £853 million (around $1.09 billion) in 2015-16 £1.62 billion (around $2.08 billion) in 2016-17 and £1.68 billion (around $2.15 billion) in 2017-18.

Australia began implementing measures in 2015 that led to the introduction of its own diverted profits tax from July 2017 onward. It imposed a 40% tax on such tax avoidance practices.

Responding to these developments global enterprises are now voluntarily paying up past dues and entering into settlements with the tax authorities to avoid being shamed by a Google tax. Diageo the London-based beverage giant behind Johnnie Walker scotch Tanqueray gin and other major brands struck an agreement with the HMRC to pay an extra £190 million (around $244 million) in corporation tax to avoid the potential damage to its brand reputation emerging from the Google tax. Google also agreed in 2016 to pay about $185 million in back taxes to the U.K.

Facing similar charges in France Google paid French authorities nearly 1 billion euros (about $1.1 billion) in fines and additional taxes in 2019. The company said at the time ""We remain convinced that a coordinated reform of the international tax system is the best way to provide a clear framework for companies operating worldwide.""

What Is a Digital Services Tax? A digital services tax (DST) is a tax imposed by certain countries on the revenues of large multinational companies offering goods or services online. As of October 2023 38 countries around the world had either enacted or were considering DSTs. They include Austria (with a 5% tax) France (3% tax) Italy (3% tax) Spain (3% tax) and the U.K. (2% tax). At the same time the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) has been working on an international agreement that would provide for taxing these companies and distributing the proceeds among the various nations eliminating the need for separate unilateral DSTs.

What Is the Double Irish Dutch Sandwich Strategy? The double Irish Dutch sandwich strategy was a tax avoidance scheme practiced at one time by Google and other companies. It involved funneling profits to an Irish subsidiary then a Dutch subsidiary and finally to a second Irish subsidiary based in a tax haven such as Bermuda. The result was to eliminate or indefinitely postpone any taxes due to the United States or other countries where the profits actually originated. The loopholes that made this possible were effectively closed as of 2020.

What Is Tax Avoidance vs. Tax Evasion? Tax avoidance involves various tactics to reduce a company's or an individual's tax obligations often by taking advantage of loopholes in the law. Tax avoidance is perfectly legal but sometimes sneaky-seeming. Tax evasion on the other hand occurs when a company or an individual attempts to reduce their tax bill by illegal means such as concealing income.

The Bottom Line

A Google tax is one that's imposed on companies that divert their profits from a country where the money was earned to another country with lower (or no) taxes. While some of the most egregious tax avoidance practices have been curtailed in recent years individual countries and global bodies continue to work on ways to tax multinational companies particularly digital ones in a fair manner.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vaW52ZXN0b3JwbGFjZS5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi9nb29nLXN0b2NrLWFsZXJ0LWFscGhhYmV0LWlzLXNwZW5kaW5nLW1vbmV5LWluLWFsbC10aGUtd3JvbmctcGxhY2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GOOG Stock Alert: Alphabet Is Spending Money in All the Wrong Places,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vZ3JhcGhpY3MvMjAyMy1vcGluaW9uLWdvb2dsZS1haS1pbWFnZXMtcXVpei_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Can't Catch All the AI Images.

The workers also took the opportunity to castigate their employers for contracts with the Israeli military.

Ubeid had graduated from a Google-funded coding bootcamp Gaza Sky Geeks and later interned at a firm that was part of the Google for Startups accelerator program in 2020. Those who knew her have described her in written tributes and in interviews with the Guardian as a strong and determined visionary. She had muscular dystrophy and as such used a wheelchair to get around. Ubeid dreamed of one day developing a platform for people with disabilities to network and connect according to Kathrine Tinggaard Nicolaisen a former communications manager at Gaza Sky Geeks based in the West Bank who knew and had met Ubeid.

For those in Gaza Ubeid’s life was a shining example of what a person in the besieged strip could accomplish in the tech industry if given the access and resources. “Where she was at in her life was a massive milestone for any Gazan to be able to say that they’d achieved” Nicolaisen said.

For Google workers Ubeid’s killing was another reminder of their employers’ $1.2bn contract to provide the Israeli government and military with cloud and machine learning services codenamed Project Nimbus. Many Google workers have spent the last two years protesting arguing their employer is providing tools that aid what human rights groups call apartheid imposed on Palestinians by Israel. Despite worker efforts to bring more attention to Ubeid’s killing the company has so far declined to publicly or internally acknowledge her death according to several employees who spoke at the vigil. For Mohammad Khatami a Google software engineer and one of the organizers of the vigil the silence of the company and the chief executive Sundar Pichai on Ubeid’s death “is a betrayal in the purest sense of the word”.

“No email no difficulty no decision not public statement and absolutely no shame” Khatami said at the Tuesday vigil just outside Google’s offices. “Shame on [Pichai] and shame on Google.”

A Google spokesperson Courtenay Mencini declined to respond to direct questions about the company’s lack of acknowledgment of Ubeid’s death but said that this was a “highly sensitive time and topic in every company” and that Google had “many employees who are personally affected”.

“The overwhelming majority of those employees are not engaged in internal discussions or debate and many have said they’ve appreciated our fast response and our focus on the safety of our employees” Mencini said.

Mencini also said the company’s Nimbus contract only provides “commercial” services for Israeli government ministries including finance healthcare transportation and education – not for “highly sensitive or classified military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services”. However when announcing the contract with Amazon and Google Israel’s finance ministry told Haaretz the companies would be providing cloud solutions to the government and “the defense establishment”. The company declined to respond to follow-up questions about why Israel’s government has described the nature of the contract in different terms.

The idea that I even have to qualify my humanity to say that I don’t condone the killing of innocent people points to some sort of racism Mohammad Khatami

About 50 people gathered in the small park flanked by the Hudson River and the Google-owned Chelsea market building. Google and Amazon workers including those behind the No Tech for Apartheid campaign were joined by representatives from Palestinian advocacy groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace and Within Our Lifetime. A banner that urged Google and Amazon to drop Project Nimbus was held up alongside a table with a poster celebrating Ubeid’s life. “Engineer. Daughter. Creator. Software Engineer in Google-Backed Internship. Martyred in Israeli Airstrike” the poster read referring to Ubeid with the Arabic word “shaheed” commonly translated to “martyr” but meaning something closer to “witness”.

The vigil was held just weeks after Khatami said he was singled out by Google human resources for circulating an anonymous open letter from employees that said Project Nimbus was contributing to Israel’s human rights abuses against Palestinians. Khatami was among a number of Google workers who circulated the email internally which cited Israel’s ongoing bombardment of the Gaza strip and said Google could become “complicit in what history will remember as a genocide” according to the Intercept. However Khatami the only Muslim among those circulating the email said he was the sole worker called into HR.

Khatami told the Guardian he was asked whether he thought his words could be seen as a justification for the 7 October Hamas attacks on southern Israel. “The idea that I even have to qualify my humanity to say that I don’t condone the killing of innocent people points to some sort of racism” he said in an interview with the Guardian before the vigil. “But even then I’ve gone out of my way to make it clear that no violence against innocent people is acceptable. We were just explaining ‘Hey Google’s complicit in this occupation and if we want the violence to end we have to go to the root cause of it.’”

Google’s Mencini did not go into specific details about whether Khatami was singled out but said the company follows up on every employee concerned raised “and in this case dozens of employees reported this individual’s email – not the sharing of the petition itself”.

Khatami and other workers say they don’t feel safe speaking up in support of Palestinian human rights calling Google executives’ response to the thousands of civilians who have been killed in Israeli airstrikes inadequate. Just last year Ariel Koren a former Google employee said the company retaliated against her by trying to force her to transfer to Brazil after she organized employee-led actions against Project Nimbus. Koren later quit but still works with the No Tech for Apartheid campaign.

Lourdes Rohan an associate product marketing manager at Google read a speech at the vigil from a reverend who could not attend plastic Google employee badge still hanging from a belt loop. Rohan who uses they/them pronouns disagreed with the company’s involvement in Project Nimbus a position they stressed was “my own feelings”. Rohan said they haven’t received a message about Ubeid’s death an example they said of a dearth of internal discussion of the conflict and space to express grief for its casualties. They said Google has worded its responses to the conflict “like politicians” to carefully not seem one-sided. They have worked in the company’s Chelsea offices for a year and a half after graduating from Yale.

Attending the vigil and speaking up probably put their job at risk they said. “I’ve been told to be afraid like people say ‘Oh you don’t want to lose your job’ but I know what I stand for I know who I am and if calling for the end to a genocide is going to get me fired that will just be a way for me to come to a job that more aligns with my values. Other people may not feel the same way. Obviously I don’t want to be fired. I’ll be OK” they said.

Zelda Montes a software engineer at YouTube came to the vigil both to demonstrate their disagreement with Project Nimbus and because they felt a kinship with Ubeid. Montes had participated in similar intern programs as the young Palestinian coder. They felt nervous speaking out and attending the event because they are the first in their family to graduate from college they said but decided the cause was too important.

“Mai’s name will always be remembered with honor and power and blessings and love” Khatami said at the end of his speech. But he urged Google to “stay consistent” with its own stated values of “don’t be evil”."

Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) the U.K.'s tax collection agency secured £6.5 billion (around $8.33 billion) in additional taxes by challenging the transfer pricing arrangements of multinationals between 2012-2018. Its own figures show that it took in an extra £853 million (around $1.09 billion) in 2015-16 £1.62 billion (around $2.08 billion) in 2016-17 and £1.68 billion (around $2.15 billion) in 2017-18.

Australia began implementing measures in 2015 that led to the introduction of its own diverted profits tax from July 2017 onward. It imposed a 40% tax on such tax avoidance practices.

Responding to these developments global enterprises are now voluntarily paying up past dues and entering into settlements with the tax authorities to avoid being shamed by a Google tax. Diageo the London-based beverage giant behind Johnnie Walker scotch Tanqueray gin and other major brands struck an agreement with the HMRC to pay an extra £190 million (around $244 million) in corporation tax to avoid the potential damage to its brand reputation emerging from the Google tax. Google also agreed in 2016 to pay about $185 million in back taxes to the U.K.

Facing similar charges in France Google paid French authorities nearly 1 billion euros (about $1.1 billion) in fines and additional taxes in 2019. The company said at the time ""We remain convinced that a coordinated reform of the international tax system is the best way to provide a clear framework for companies operating worldwide.""

What Is a Digital Services Tax? A digital services tax (DST) is a tax imposed by certain countries on the revenues of large multinational companies offering goods or services online. As of October 2023 38 countries around the world had either enacted or were considering DSTs. They include Austria (with a 5% tax) France (3% tax) Italy (3% tax) Spain (3% tax) and the U.K. (2% tax). At the same time the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) has been working on an international agreement that would provide for taxing these companies and distributing the proceeds among the various nations eliminating the need for separate unilateral DSTs.

What Is the Double Irish Dutch Sandwich Strategy? The double Irish Dutch sandwich strategy was a tax avoidance scheme practiced at one time by Google and other companies. It involved funneling profits to an Irish subsidiary then a Dutch subsidiary and finally to a second Irish subsidiary based in a tax haven such as Bermuda. The result was to eliminate or indefinitely postpone any taxes due to the United States or other countries where the profits actually originated. The loopholes that made this possible were effectively closed as of 2020.

What Is Tax Avoidance vs. Tax Evasion? Tax avoidance involves various tactics to reduce a company's or an individual's tax obligations often by taking advantage of loopholes in the law. Tax avoidance is perfectly legal but sometimes sneaky-seeming. Tax evasion on the other hand occurs when a company or an individual attempts to reduce their tax bill by illegal means such as concealing income.

The Bottom Line

A Google tax is one that's imposed on companies that divert their profits from a country where the money was earned to another country with lower (or no) taxes. While some of the most egregious tax avoidance practices have been curtailed in recent years individual countries and global bodies continue to work on ways to tax multinational companies particularly digital ones in a fair manner.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vaW52ZXN0b3JwbGFjZS5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi9nb29nLXN0b2NrLWFsZXJ0LWFscGhhYmV0LWlzLXNwZW5kaW5nLW1vbmV5LWluLWFsbC10aGUtd3JvbmctcGxhY2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GOOG Stock Alert: Alphabet Is Spending Money in All the Wrong Places,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vZ3JhcGhpY3MvMjAyMy1vcGluaW9uLWdvb2dsZS1haS1pbWFnZXMtcXVpei_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google Can't Catch All the AI Images.

The workers also took the opportunity to castigate their employers for contracts with the Israeli military.

Ubeid had graduated from a Google-funded coding bootcamp Gaza Sky Geeks and later interned at a firm that was part of the Google for Startups accelerator program in 2020. Those who knew her have described her in written tributes and in interviews with the Guardian as a strong and determined visionary. She had muscular dystrophy and as such used a wheelchair to get around. Ubeid dreamed of one day developing a platform for people with disabilities to network and connect according to Kathrine Tinggaard Nicolaisen a former communications manager at Gaza Sky Geeks based in the West Bank who knew and had met Ubeid.

For those in Gaza Ubeid’s life was a shining example of what a person in the besieged strip could accomplish in the tech industry if given the access and resources. “Where she was at in her life was a massive milestone for any Gazan to be able to say that they’d achieved” Nicolaisen said.

For Google workers Ubeid’s killing was another reminder of their employers’ $1.2bn contract to provide the Israeli government and military with cloud and machine learning services codenamed Project Nimbus. Many Google workers have spent the last two years protesting arguing their employer is providing tools that aid what human rights groups call apartheid imposed on Palestinians by Israel. Despite worker efforts to bring more attention to Ubeid’s killing the company has so far declined to publicly or internally acknowledge her death according to several employees who spoke at the vigil. For Mohammad Khatami a Google software engineer and one of the organizers of the vigil the silence of the company and the chief executive Sundar Pichai on Ubeid’s death “is a betrayal in the purest sense of the word”.

“No email no difficulty no decision not public statement and absolutely no shame” Khatami said at the Tuesday vigil just outside Google’s offices. “Shame on [Pichai] and shame on Google.”

A Google spokesperson Courtenay Mencini declined to respond to direct questions about the company’s lack of acknowledgment of Ubeid’s death but said that this was a “highly sensitive time and topic in every company” and that Google had “many employees who are personally affected”.

“The overwhelming majority of those employees are not engaged in internal discussions or debate and many have said they’ve appreciated our fast response and our focus on the safety of our employees” Mencini said.

Mencini also said the company’s Nimbus contract only provides “commercial” services for Israeli government ministries including finance healthcare transportation and education – not for “highly sensitive or classified military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services”. However when announcing the contract with Amazon and Google Israel’s finance ministry told Haaretz the companies would be providing cloud solutions to the government and “the defense establishment”. The company declined to respond to follow-up questions about why Israel’s government has described the nature of the contract in different terms.

The idea that I even have to qualify my humanity to say that I don’t condone the killing of innocent people points to some sort of racism Mohammad Khatami

About 50 people gathered in the small park flanked by the Hudson River and the Google-owned Chelsea market building. Google and Amazon workers including those behind the No Tech for Apartheid campaign were joined by representatives from Palestinian advocacy groups such as Jewish Voice for Peace and Within Our Lifetime. A banner that urged Google and Amazon to drop Project Nimbus was held up alongside a table with a poster celebrating Ubeid’s life. “Engineer. Daughter. Creator. Software Engineer in Google-Backed Internship. Martyred in Israeli Airstrike” the poster read referring to Ubeid with the Arabic word “shaheed” commonly translated to “martyr” but meaning something closer to “witness”.

The vigil was held just weeks after Khatami said he was singled out by Google human resources for circulating an anonymous open letter from employees that said Project Nimbus was contributing to Israel’s human rights abuses against Palestinians. Khatami was among a number of Google workers who circulated the email internally which cited Israel’s ongoing bombardment of the Gaza strip and said Google could become “complicit in what history will remember as a genocide” according to the Intercept. However Khatami the only Muslim among those circulating the email said he was the sole worker called into HR.

Khatami told the Guardian he was asked whether he thought his words could be seen as a justification for the 7 October Hamas attacks on southern Israel. “The idea that I even have to qualify my humanity to say that I don’t condone the killing of innocent people points to some sort of racism” he said in an interview with the Guardian before the vigil. “But even then I’ve gone out of my way to make it clear that no violence against innocent people is acceptable. We were just explaining ‘Hey Google’s complicit in this occupation and if we want the violence to end we have to go to the root cause of it.’”

Google’s Mencini did not go into specific details about whether Khatami was singled out but said the company follows up on every employee concerned raised “and in this case dozens of employees reported this individual’s email – not the sharing of the petition itself”.

Khatami and other workers say they don’t feel safe speaking up in support of Palestinian human rights calling Google executives’ response to the thousands of civilians who have been killed in Israeli airstrikes inadequate. Just last year Ariel Koren a former Google employee said the company retaliated against her by trying to force her to transfer to Brazil after she organized employee-led actions against Project Nimbus. Koren later quit but still works with the No Tech for Apartheid campaign.

Lourdes Rohan an associate product marketing manager at Google read a speech at the vigil from a reverend who could not attend plastic Google employee badge still hanging from a belt loop. Rohan who uses they/them pronouns disagreed with the company’s involvement in Project Nimbus a position they stressed was “my own feelings”. Rohan said they haven’t received a message about Ubeid’s death an example they said of a dearth of internal discussion of the conflict and space to express grief for its casualties. They said Google has worded its responses to the conflict “like politicians” to carefully not seem one-sided. They have worked in the company’s Chelsea offices for a year and a half after graduating from Yale.

Attending the vigil and speaking up probably put their job at risk they said. “I’ve been told to be afraid like people say ‘Oh you don’t want to lose your job’ but I know what I stand for I know who I am and if calling for the end to a genocide is going to get me fired that will just be a way for me to come to a job that more aligns with my values. Other people may not feel the same way. Obviously I don’t want to be fired. I’ll be OK” they said.

Zelda Montes a software engineer at YouTube came to the vigil both to demonstrate their disagreement with Project Nimbus and because they felt a kinship with Ubeid. Montes had participated in similar intern programs as the young Palestinian coder. They felt nervous speaking out and attending the event because they are the first in their family to graduate from college they said but decided the cause was too important.

“Mai’s name will always be remembered with honor and power and blessings and love” Khatami said at the end of his speech. But he urged Google to “stay consistent” with its own stated values of “don’t be evil”."

Top Analyst Reports for Exxon Mobil Oracle and Cisco Systems

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks including Exxon Mobil Corp. Oracle Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Shares of Exxon Mobil have underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (-4.4% vs. -2.9%). The company’s dividend yield is lower than the composite stocks belonging to the industry. Thus ExxonMobil is lagging its peers when it comes to shareholders’ returns.



Moreover the integrated company reported weak third quarter earnings primarily resulted from the oil equivalent production decline and lower realizations of crude and natural gas prices. Nevertheless ExxonMobil's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play.



In the Stabroek Block located off the coast of Guyana ExxonMobil has made many major discoveries that significantly improve its production outlook. The advantaged growth projects of Guyana have lower greenhouse gas intensity than most of the oil and gas-producing resources across the globe.

Oracle shares have gained +44.3% over the year-to-date basis against the Zacks Computer - Software industry’s gain of +57.3%. The company is benefiting from the ongoing momentum across its cloud business driven by the strong uptake of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Autonomous Database offerings. Solid adoption of cloud-based applications comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Fusion ERP bodes well.



Oracle’s Gen 2 Cloud is delivering better performance at a lower cost due to high bandwidth and low-latency RDMA networks. Partnerships with VMWare and Microsoft are helping Oracle win new clientele. ORCL is launching a generative AI cloud service for enterprise customers. Its share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy.



However higher spending on product enhancements especially toward the cloud platform amid increasing competition in the cloud domain is likely to limit margin expansion.

Shares of Cisco Systems have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the year-to-date basis (+4.0% vs. +2.1%). The company is riding on the growing demand for its security artificial intelligence and cloud products.

The S&P 500 is the benchmark for the investing world. This well-known index comprises 500 of the largest and most visible corporations in the United States the world's leading economy.

It's also a great hunting ground for phenomenal long-term stock ideas to fit any investing strategy. Dividend investors are a large group with a specific investing strategy buying stocks that will help them build large income streams from dividends. Many of these dividend enthusiasts rely on these five generous dividend-paying S&P 500 stocks for their huge payouts.

Let's find out a bit more about these five stocks.

1. Altria Group

American tobacco giant Altria Group (MO 0.67%) has made millions for shareholders over the past century selling Marlboro cigarettes in the United States. The company's golden years are far behind it now that the general public is better informed about the dangers of smoking. Still the addictive properties of nicotine give Altria the pricing power to continue growing profits despite smoking rates declining since the 1960s.

Cigarettes are cheap to manufacture so the company has few operating expenses. Most of Altria's profits go to shareholders as dividends. The company's dividend payout ratio is roughly 80% of cash flow. Altria's raised the dividend 58 times over the past 54 years meaning investors are getting paid more over time. Shares offer a generous 9.3% dividend yield at today's share price.

2. AbbVie

Pharmaceuticals are a lucrative industry especially if the company manages to develop a blockbuster drug. Patents protect proprietary formulas from competition for several years and allow the company to benefit from its development efforts. AbbVie (ABBV -0.38%) was a significant benefactor for several years from the success of Humira the world's top-selling drug. Unfortunately its patent protection expired recently. But don't worry; the company used its Humira profits to build the rest of the company into a juggernaut and it has several other drugs ready or in development to take up the slack.

AbbVie has become a favorite among dividend investors. Not only is the yield juicy at 4.5% but the payout has also grown by an average of 17% annually over the past decade. The dividend payout ratio is still manageable at 42% of cash flow so investors could see a nice one-two combo of yield and dividend growth moving forward.

3. Verizon Communications

Virtually everyone in America has a cellphone or smartphone. The importance of smartphones to consumers' everyday lives has made telecommunications companies like Verizon Communications (VZ 0.03%) more like utility companies. People seemingly pay their phone bills as religiously as their water or electricity. This creates steady revenue streams for Verizon which results in fertile ground for steady and increasing dividend payments.

Verizon must invest constantly in upgrading and maintaining its wireless network so investors should look at net income instead of cash flow to judge the dividend. Fortunately Verizon spends just half its earnings on the dividend so investors should be in good shape with its 7.1% dividend yield.

4. Philip Morris International

Marlboro is a worldwide brand but Altria only sells it in America. Philip Morris International (PM 0.32%) was spun off from Altria over a decade ago and owns international rights to Marlboro. That shortens its dividend history but Philip Morris has raised its dividend yearly as a public company. That streak currently stands at 15 years. The dividend payout ratio is high at 103% but profits could grow and bring that ratio down over the coming years.

How? Philip Morris has done a great job innovating and moving into growing nicotine categories. It developed IQOS a device that heats (but doesn't burn) tobacco to produce vapor. It also acquired Swedish Match which makes the Zyn brand of oral nicotine pouches. Philip Morris is bringing these opportunities to global markets including America so the stock has long-term growth potential.

5. AT&T

A small group of significant players dominates the U.S. wireless communications market. Verizon is second-largest to AT&T (T -0.12%) which holds a 47% share. Today AT&T is a different company from what it's been for most of the decade. It tried failed and exited the entertainment industry and is now concentrating on telecommunications again. The stock offers a dividend yield of more than 6.8%.

It's not all rosy. The company still carries $138 billion in long-term debt scars from its former entertainment ambitions. However the dividend payout ratio is back to under half of net income after management cut the dividend once to free up more money to pay off its debt. Financially AT&T seems back on its feet giving investors confidence to continue the dividends.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWFscGVuYW5ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8yMDIzLzEyL2Fwcy1qb2lucy1uYXRpb25hbC1jbGFzcy1hY3Rpb24tbGF3c3VpdC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,APS joins national class-action lawsuit | News Sports Jobs,"ALPENA — The Alpena Public Schools Board of Education agreed to sign on to a nationwide class-action lawsuit against social media companies Facebook Instagram YouTube Snapchat and TikTok for causing addiction and mental health problems in children and teens.

According to the lawsuit the platforms and their parent companies cause mental health issues in adolescents such as anxiety depression suicidal ideations and more.

APS Superintendent David Rabbideau said that a key reason why the district wanted to join was because of the “countless negative impacts” the district has seen in students.

“I remember there was a TikTok trend where it was recording yourself vandalizing school property” Rabbideau said. “Compared to other school districts we were lucky enough to only have minor damages during that time.”

Social media company heads have denied any wrongdoing and said in fact their standards discourage use of their platforms by young teens and that they’ve implemented numerous tools to help teens and families such as automatic time limits for teen users.

The use of social media among teens is nearly universal in the U.S. and many other parts of the world. Almost all teens ages 13 to 17 in the U.S. report using a social media platform with about a third saying they use social media “almost constantly” according to the Pew Research Center.

Joining class-action lawsuits is not new to APS as they joined one against JUUL and other vape manufacturers. The district accepted money from settlements with JUUL and Altria Co. and used the undisclosed amount of funds to offset the cost of the schools’ vape detectors.

Rabbideau said that if the social media lawsuit sees a settlement the district would use the money to create a better educational program to show the downsides of social media.

“We’ve really implemented our phone guidelines this year so kids don’t use their phones during normal school hours” Rabbideau said. “We’re seeing benefits with this. Students are interacting more with students and teachers. We are not seeing nearly the levels of conflict between students as most of that conflict can happen on social media and on phones.”

According to the APS student handbook elementary students can have a phone but it must be put away and powered off.

Middle school students can use their phones during lunch hours but must have it powered off before and afterward.

High school students can leave their phones on but may only use them between class periods and during lunch hours.

“The crux of it is that there are countless negative impacts from social media” Rabbideau said. “These companies are targeting minors with their marketing and hurting the mental health of the students whose brains are still developing. Let’s right the wrongs.”

Meanwhile in Germany legalization appears to have lost some of its momentum. Hopes were high when in 2021 a new coalition government announced it would permit licensed shops to sell recreational cannabis to adults i.e. those from the age of 18. The move would have made Germany the biggest EU cannabis market by far. With the legalization the government aimed to starve the illegal market decriminalize occasional users lower criminal justice expenditures and protect public health. The expected cannabis tax experts predicted could contribute up to €1.8 billion ($1.92 billion) annually to the state treasury.

Two years on all that remains of the lofty plans is a watered-down version. After realizing that full legalization of recreational cannabis would interfere with the U.N. Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961) and EU legislation the cabinet on Aug. 16 2023 approved a bill that would allow adults to possess up to 25 grams of the drug grow a maximum of three plants and acquire weed as members of nonprofit cannabis clubs. The government said it would also launch a pilot project to test the effects of a commercial supply chain for recreational cannabis over five years—a proposal for which it will need to present separate legislation.

The legislation was scheduled to pass Parliament on Nov. 16 2023 making cannabis legal from Jan. 1 2024. However after meeting fierce opposition from numerous parties among them conservative policymakers who warned that legalization would encourage cannabis use and create more work for authorities industry associations and consumer advocacy groups the final reading was delayed to mid-December.

In a Nov. 6 parliamentary hearing the German Cannabis Association (DHV) pointed out that the possession cap of 25 grams per year made home cultivation impossible as it referred to fresh flowers which tend to lose weight after drying. “Under these conditions no one will take the trouble to cultivate cannabis” says DHV Managing Director Georg Wurth. “The limit would be a promotion scheme for the black market.”

DHV also advocates to allow private growers to cultivate more than three plants and criticizes the distance rule which stipulates that consumption will neither be allowed in cannabis clubs nor within a 200-meter distance of schools kindergartens playgrounds or cannabis clubs. “Such a distance—or any obligatory distance—would mean that in populated areas there would be no space left for legal consumption” he says. “The idea to completely prohibit consumption on the premises of clubs whose only aim is to cultivate cannabis is unrealistic and makes no sense. The envisaged distance rule for cannabis clubs is similarly absurd as it does nothing for youth prevention.”

Furthermore the punishments for violations described in the proposed legislation are too harsh according to Wurth. The bill stipulates imprisonment of up to three years for the possession of 26 grams of cannabis or the cultivation of four plants. Consumption-related offences involve high fines. Smoking pot in a 190-meter radius from a school for example could cost the user up to €100000. The DHV also calls for a legal opportunity to consume self-cultivated cannabis with friends. “After all the goal is to deprive the black market of as much consumed cannabis as possible” Wurth says. The association also calls for equal treatment of cannabis and alcohol in road traffic and an alignment of sanctions.

At press time an amended version of the bill that takes into account stakeholders’ input had not been released. The first part of the planned cannabis reform in Germany is now expected to become effective on April 1 2024 at the earliest.",,,

Q is “experiencing severe hallucinations and leaking confidential data” including the location of AWS data centers internal discount programs and unreleased features according to leaked documents obtained by Platformer.

An employee marked the incident as “sev 2” meaning an incident bad enough to warrant paging engineers at night and make them work through the weekend to fix it.

Q’s early woes come at a time when Amazon is working to fight the perception that Microsoft Google and other tech companies have surpassed it in the race to build tools and infrastructure that take advantage of generative artificial intelligence. In September the company announced it would invest up to $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic. On Tuesday at its annual Amazon Web Services developer conference it announced Q — arguably the highest-profile release in the series of new AI initiatives the company unveiled this week.

In a statement Amazon played down the significance of the employee discussions.

“Some employees are sharing feedback through internal channels and ticketing systems which is standard practice at Amazon” a spokesperson said. “No security issue was identified as a result of that feedback. We appreciate all of the feedback we’ve already received and will continue to tune Q as it transitions from being a product in preview to being generally available.”

After publication the spokesperson sent another statement pushing back on employees’ claims: “Amazon Q has not leaked confidential information.”

Q which is now available in a free preview was presented as a kind of enterprise-software version of ChatGPT. Initially it will be able to answer developers’ questions about AWS edit source code and cite sources Amazon executives said onstage this week. It will compete with similar tools from Microsoft and Google but be priced lower than rivals’ at least to start.

In unveiling Q executives promoted it as more secure than consumer-grade tools like ChatGPT.

Adam Selipsky CEO of Amazon Web Services told the New York Times that companies “had banned these A.I. assistants from the enterprise because of the security and privacy concerns.” In response the Times reported “Amazon built Q to be more secure and private than a consumer chatbot.”

An internal document about Q’s hallucinations and wrong answers notes that “Amazon Q can hallucinate and return harmful or inappropriate responses. For example Amazon Q might return out of date security information that could put customer accounts at risk.” The risks outlined in the document are typical of large language models all of which return incorrect or inappropriate responses at least some of the time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L2JyYXppbC1sYXVuY2hlcy0yMDQtbWlsbGlvbi1kcml2ZS1yZXN0b3JlLWFtYXpvbi1yYWluZm9yZXN0LTIwMjMtMTItMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brazil launches $204 million drive to restore Amazon rainforest,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/brazil-launches-204-million-drive-restore-amazon-rainforest-2023-12-02/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L2JyYXppbC1sYXVuY2hlcy0yMDQtbWlsbGlvbi1kcml2ZS1yZXN0b3JlLWFtYXpvbi1yYWluZm9yZXN0LTIwMjMtMTItMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vc3BhY2VuZXdzLmNvbS9hbWF6b24tYWRkcy1mYWxjb24tOS10by1tdWx0aS1iaWxsaW9uLWRvbGxhci1wcm9qZWN0LWt1aXBlci1sYXVuY2gtY2FtcGFpZ24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon adds Falcon 9 to multi-billion-dollar Project Kuiper launch campaign,"TAMPA Fla. — Amazon has signed a contract with SpaceX to launch an unspecified number of satellites for its Project Kuiper broadband constellation on three Falcon 9 rockets from mid-2025.

The deal adds extra capacity to a multi-billion-dollar launch arrangement already in place for deploying most of the constellation’s more than 3200 satellites with United Launch Alliance (ULA) Arianespace and Blue Origin.

It comes months after a pension fund filed a suit against Amazon’s board of directors claiming they “acted in bad faith” in approving the bulk of Kuiper launches to unproven rockets being developed by these three companies without considering SpaceX.

Amazon has ordered eight Atlas 5 and 38 Vulcan rockets from ULA 17 Ariane 6 launches from Arianespace and up to 27 New Glenn missions from Blue Origin. Of these only the Atlas 5 is currently operational.

Blue Origin is owned by Amazon’s billionaire founder Jeff Bezos and the lawsuit suggested personal animus between Bezos and SpaceX founder Elon Musk had prevented Amazon from considering the company.

An Amazon spokesperson said the “claims in the lawsuit are completely without merit and had no impact on our procurement plans for Project Kuiper.”

The company declined to disclose more information about the SpaceX launch contract beyond a brief blog post published Dec. 1.

Following successful tests of two prototypes that ULA launched to low Earth orbit in October Amazon recently said it is ready to begin producing the rest of the constellation for a launch campaign kicking off in the first half of early 2024.

Initial services are slated to begin later in 2024 with potential customers including three telcos: Verizon in the United States Vodafone in Europe and Africa and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation in Japan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS90ZWNobm9sb2d5LzIwMjMvMTIvMDIvYW1hem9uLWlzcmFlbC1nYXphLXdhci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Employees at Amazon push company to drop Israel deal as bombings continue,More than 100 Amazon employees in 20 cities gathered to eat knafeh and observe International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People but in two offices the event was interrupted by fliers that said “KIDNAPPED” above photos of Israeli hostages.

AEE,Ameren,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiuwFodHRwczovL2hlcmFsZC1yZXZpZXcuY29tL25ld3MvY29tbXVuaXR5L2lsbGlub2lzLWVwYS1leHBsYWlucy1vZG9yLWF0LXRheWxvcnZpbGxlLXN1cGVyZnVuZC1zaXRlLWRvZXMtbGl0dGxlLXRvLXF1ZWxsLWNvbW11bml0eS1jb25jZXJucy9hcnRpY2xlXzcxZTZkNGNjLTkwODUtMTFlZS05ZWIwLWVmN2Q2MWUwY2YwYy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Illinois EPA explains odor at Taylorville Superfund site does little to quell community concerns,"TAYLORVILLE — The Illinois Environmental Protection Agency offered little in the form of new information Thursday about a foul odor that began emanating from an Ameren-owned Superfund site earlier this year.

The smell led to community concerns about potential exposure to cancer-causing contaminants known to be present on site.

About 50 people gathered at Taylorville Middle School for the nearly three-hour meeting which came about two months after the state EPA requested and Ameren agreed to stop work on a pilot project aimed at expediting remediation of the site.

The pause the agency says was enacted out of an abundance of caution. And work will not resume until after air monitoring data from the site is analyzed by the agency. But there should be no cause for alarm they say.

""For water we have 30 years of data to show that the plume is contained on the site and not migrating towards residences"" said Greggory Miller an environmental protection specialist with the state EPA. ""For air nothing I've seen from these initial reports is what I personally would consider to be alarming. But we are evaluating the air monitoring data we are seeing from Ameren.""

There were no officials present from Ameren the entity responsible for cleaning up the site.

The 1.2-acre site formally known as ""CIPS Taylorville"" is located on the south end of town directly across the street from Manners Park and just feet away from homes.

It is the site of a former manufactured gas plant that was in operation from 1892 to 1932. The coal gasification process produced a carcinogenic byproduct known as coal tar.

Following the plant's decommissioning Ameren predecessor company Central Illinois Public Service Company sold the site without disclosing the presence of more than 50000 gallons of coal tar in tanks buried underneath the site.

The contamination was discovered in 1985 when the owner at the time was having work done on the site. Ameren then notified the EPA of buried contaminants on the site and agreed to buy it back and remediate.

However many believe that a clumsy cleanup process inadvertently contaminated the surrounding air and groundwater.

Between March 1989 and August 1991 three infants and a teenager who lived within three miles of the site were diagnosed with neuroblastoma a rare form of cancer that statistically should only occur once every 29 years in a community the size of Taylorville.

One of the patients Brandon Steele died from the disease. The four families sued the company and were eventually awarded $3.2 million.

Brenda Kimble whose now-34-year-old daughter Erika was one of the neuroblastoma patients said her phone and social media started blowing up when people started smelling the odor in September. It was an unwelcome blast from the past.

""They dug this huge pit in the middle of summer and exposed everyone once again"" Kimble told Herald & Review. ""And it's been going on for years. When they go out there and they dig and they work it's volatile and we get exposed.""

Kimble and other concerned residents founded the group My Community My Family in response to the odors and have been seeking answers.

But officials with the state EPA say at least preliminarily there is nothing to be alarmed about blaming the mothball-like smell on a new process meant to expedite remediation not contaminants being released into the air as happened in the 1980s.

Since 1995 there has been a groundwater pump-and-treat system on site meant to remediate contaminated groundwater. While the system has led to ""a significant reduction"" in contaminants state EPA officials estimate that it would take about 100 years for groundwater to be at acceptable standards with the continued use of the process.

""Pump and treat was very popular 30 years ago"" Miller said. ""And now it's not getting us down past that last little bit that we need to be in to declare the groundwater ready for beneficial reuse which is the ultimate goal of this program.""

""We prefer to have a solution in our own lifetimes"" he added.

As such the Illinois EPA and Ameren have been considering alternative approaches. The state agency approved in June and initiated in August a pilot project meant to display the possible effectiveness of an alternative known as in situ solidification and stabilization (ISS).

According to the U.S. EPA ISS is a cleanup method that prevents or slows the release of harmful chemicals from waste. These typically do not eradicate the contaminant but instead keep them from ""leaching"" above safe levels into surrounding areas.

This process involves mixing impacted soil with a binding agent such as cement. This creates a solid block of material and traps it in place.

According to the state EPA the smell coming from the site can be explained by this process. While slurry is setting it swells. This swell material when exposed to air can lead to an odor they said.

But many in attendance simply did not buy the agency's explanation. Skepticism about the validity of Ameren's air quality data was widespread with one person likening it to ""the fox guarding the henhouse.""

State EPA officials said they are still analyzing air quality data provided by Ameren but community relations manager Brad Frost said that Ameren and the labs the contract with ""are not falsifying data.""

When asked when the agency would be finished with its analysis Frost said ""I don't have a timeframe.""

Many also wanted the holes drilled as part of the ISS pilot to be covered or backfilled. Kimble's group was also advocating for more exact signage warning people that it is a Superfund site.

But for many the answers were inadequate or the state EPA did not have the information requested such as public health data.

The meeting ended somewhat abruptly after many started to leave exasperated with the answers state officials were giving them. Though many came up afterward and thanked the government bureaucrats for showing up and attempting to address their concerns something Ameren did not do.

Kimple said she was ""very frustrated"" that Ameren did not have a representative at the meeting adding that ""there's no excuse for them not to be here.""

Ameren spokesman Brian Bretsch said the threat of litigation kept the utility giant from the public meeting.

""We maintain a robust outreach program with appropriate stakeholders including neighbors governmental agencies and are in ongoing discussions with IEPA"" Bretsch said. ""Unfortunately some members of the public have threatened litigation and therefore Ameren believed that participation in this type of forum would be counterproductive.""

Kimble's group has been meeting once a week since late September. She said next steps will include upping community outreach and moving forward with their own air quality testing around the site.

""So moving forward we are going to be two steps ahead not one step behind"" she said. ""And we're moving forward with our group.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vcGlyZy5vcmcvaWxsaW5vaXMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvZ2FzLXV0aWxpdHktcmF0ZS1oaWtlLXdoYXQtZG9lcy1pdC1tZWFuLWZvci1tZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gas utility rate hike: What does it mean for me?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://pirg.org/illinois/articles/gas-utility-rate-hike-what-does-it-mean-for-me/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vcGlyZy5vcmcvaWxsaW5vaXMvYXJ0aWNsZXMvZ2FzLXV0aWxpdHktcmF0ZS1oaWtlLXdoYXQtZG9lcy1pdC1tZWFuLWZvci1tZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vY2hhbXBhaWduaWwuZ292LzIwMjMvMTIvMDEvdGhpcmQtc3RyZWV0LXJvYWQtY2xvc3VyZS1iZXR3ZWVuLXdhc2hpbmd0b24tc3RyZWV0LWFuZC1oaWxsLXN0cmVldC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Third Street Road Closure (between Washington Street and Hill Street),In order to complete scheduled improvements to gas mains and services Ameren Illinois will close Third Street between Washington Street and Hill Street.

Vernon man was injured when his pickup went out of control Friday afternoon after embers from a cigarette blew into his face.

The crash occurred on US 51 north of the Country Bobs Plant just south of the Wamac city limits.

Irvington Police who handled the crash reported Robert Biggs of Opdyke Avenue was traveling southbound on US 51 when he rolled down his window and lit a cigarette. He lost control when he tried to get the embers off his face when they blew back in through the window. The pickup truck then ramped over the Yards Road intersection and rolled over sideways several times. In the process Biggs struck an Ameren power pole causing it to break in two. However the power lines remained in place.

Biggs was out of the vehicle when emergency help arrived on the scene from the Centralia Police Department and Centralia Fire Protection District.

Biggs was taken via Lifestar Ambulance to SSM Health St. Mary’s Hospital in Centralia for treatment of a head laceration. Unfortunately his dog was not as fortunate as it died in the crash.

The crash was first reported at 2:57 Friday afternoon."

The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee issued a news release saying it was ""deeply troubled"" by the incident which occurred on American Airlines flight 2829 from New York's JFK Airport to Phoenix.

The group said the passenger was given the option to hide the sweatshirt by turning it inside out or be removed from the plane by law enforcement.

The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee condemned American Airlines in the news release saying that actions like these make the Palestinian community feel silenced in a time of turmoil and uncertainty.

After a ceasefire fell apart on Friday the Gaza Health Ministry reported that at least 200 Palestinians had been killed according to the Associated Press. The group said that 15200 had died since the fighting began. According to USA TODAY about 1200 Israelis have died most of which were civilians killed during the deadly Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.

""The choice presented to the passenger reflects a distressing disregard for the fundamental rights of individuals to express their cultural and national identities"" the release said. ""This incident is emblematic of a larger pattern of discrimination that Palestinians and their supporters often face highlighting a concerning trend of silencing and marginalizing their voices.""

American Airlines released a statement to The Arizona Republic saying that they are looking into the matter and have reached out to the passenger to learn more about their experience and address their concerns.

""We strive to ensure all customers have a positive experience throughout their journey on American"" the statement said.

The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee has asked the airline to issue an apology to the passenger and to discuss this incident with the group to help avoid future issues.

Episode Notes

American Airlines is planning to improve its in-flight Wi-Fi access on regional jets allowing passengers to easily check emails browse the internet or stream videos.

The carrier plans to install high-speed Wi-Fi on around 500 regional aircraft starting next year in partnership with satellite services provider Intelsat writes Skift’s airline reporter Meghna Maharishi.

While American already has high-speed Wi-Fi available on 900 mainline aircraft the carrier said it wants to the same Wi-Fi service and speeds on its regional aircraft with the goal of increasing the total number of satellite-connected aircraft to more than 1400.

Next Hyatt plans to improve its hotel loyalty program in January reports senior hospitality editor Sean O’Neill.

Hyatt’s most notable change will be to expand the ability of program members to give some benefits to friends and family in one-off gifts. Before this only certain members were able to share perks which the company said has been highly popular. Those members could only share their benefits by booking a trip on behalf of someone else using points or certificates.

But come January they’ll be able to extend those benefits to someone who booked and paid for a trip on their own. Benefits include free breakfast and the possibility of a free late checkout.

Finally Trip.com Group said Thursday that it has selected Amazon Web Services as its “strategic cloud provider” in a multiyear deal meant to drive innovations in travel bookings personalized recommendations and customer service writes Skift tech reporter Justin Dawes.

This article delves into the rise expansion fleet mergers and eventual decline of US Airways shedding light on its significant contributions and ongoing legacy.

Early years and expansion

US Airways’ origins can be traced back to 1937 when the company was incorporated as All American Aviation. Initially All American Aviation focused primarily on airmail services transporting mail between small communities in Pennsylvania.

The airline’s early operations relied on a fleet of small aircraft including the Stinson Reliant a popular single-engine aircraft of the time. These aircraft were suitable for short-haul flights and enabled All American Aviation to serve the needs of local communities efficiently. However as the demand for passenger transportation grew the airline recognized the potential for expansion beyond airmail services.

In the late 1940s All American Aviation expanded its operations to include scheduled passenger flights. It acquired larger aircraft such as the Douglas DC-3 and Convair 240 which offered improved capacity and range. These aircraft became the workhorses of the airline connecting various cities and towns across the region.

With the introduction of passenger services the airline underwent a name change and in 1949 it became known as All American Airways. This shift in focus marked a significant milestone in the company’s evolution seeing it transition from a mail carrier to a regional passenger airline.

As All American Airways continued to expand the airline established more routes across the United States (US) particularly in the northeastern and mid-Atlantic regions. It aimed to connect smaller communities with larger cities and became a vital transportation link for both passengers and cargo.

All American Airways underwent further transformations in the following decades including another name change in 1979 when it became USAir. This rebranding aimed to position the airline as a national carrier and reflect its growing presence beyond its regional roots.

Through strategic acquisitions and partnerships USAir continued to expand its route network and enhance its capabilities. Allegheny Airlines one of the earliest incarnations of USAir underwent a transformative journey as it acquired Mohawk Airlines. This strategic move enabled the integration of its operations and propelled US Airways onwards to expand its reach into new markets.

By the 1990s USAir had become a major player in the aviation industry operating a diverse fleet that included modern jet aircraft such as Boeing 737s and Airbus A320s. The airline established hub operations at airports such as Pittsburgh International Airport and Philadelphia International Airport facilitating efficient connections for passengers traveling across the country. It also began flights to Europe.

During this period USAir also made significant advancements in technology and customer service launching online reservation systems and implementing frequent flyer programs and Star Alliance membership in order to enhance the customer travel experience.

In 1997 USAir officially rebranded as US Airways.

Fleet development and modernization of US Airways

Throughout its history US Airways demonstrated a commitment to fleet development and modernization. The airline recognized the importance of operating a diverse and efficient fleet to meet the evolving demands of the aviation industry.

Let’s take a closer look at its fleet development and efforts toward modernization:

Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 series: US Airways incorporated the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 narrow-body aircraft into its fleet which became the backbone of its operations for medium-haul and domestic routes.

Wide-body aircraft: US Airways also operated wide-body aircraft to serve its long-haul international routes. The airline utilized the Boeing 767 and Airbus A330 among others to provide intercontinental service to destinations in Europe the Caribbean and South America.

Regional jets: recognizing the importance of connecting smaller communities and feeding traffic to its hub airports US Airways introduced regional jets into its fleet. The airline relied on the Embraer regional jet E190 to serve as feeder aircraft linking passengers from smaller regional airports to major hubs.

Fleet renewal and retirement: starting from 1989 till 2002 US Airways retired its fleet to replace older less efficient aircraft with more cutting-edge models. This initiative aimed to optimize operational efficiency reduce maintenance costs and improve the overall passenger experience. As part of this program the airline phased out older aircraft such as the Boeing 727 and Douglas DC-9 and replaced them with newer more technologically advanced alternatives.

Passenger comfort and amenities: as part of its fleet modernization efforts US Airways also focused on enhancing the passenger experience. The airline invested in cabin upgrades including improved seating in-flight entertainment systems and connectivity options.

Merger with other airlines

US Airways actively pursued mergers as a strategic approach to expand its operations and strengthen its position in the airline industry.

Here are some key mergers that played a significant role in shaping the trajectory of US Airways:

Acquisition and integration of regional airlines

US Airways further bolstered its operations through the acquisition and integration of regional airlines such as Piedmont Airlines and Mohawk Airlines. These acquisitions allowed US Airways to tap into smaller markets and strengthen its regional feed to major hub airports.

Mohawk Airlines acquired in 1972 also played a crucial role in enhancing US Airways’ regional connectivity and passenger base. Piedmont Airlines acquired in 1987 brought a significant regional presence to US Airways. It operated as a US Airways subsidiary and helped the airline expand its reach in the eastern US.

Merger with America West Airlines

In 2005 US Airways merged with America West Airlines resulting in the formation of the new US Airways Group. This merger created a stronger and more competitive airline by combining the resources networks and expertise of both carriers. By leveraging synergies and streamlining operations the merged entity aimed to enhance customer service increase efficiency and improve profitability.

The merger with America West Airlines enabled US Airways to expand its route network particularly in the western US. It allowed the airline to tap into new markets and connect more passengers to an extensive range of destinations.

Challenges and restructuring of US Airways

This is a timeline of the major events relating to later challenges faced by US Airways:

September 11 2001: the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon occurred resulting in a significant decline in air travel demand and negatively impacting the entire airline industry including US Airways.

2002: US Airways filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August due to the financial strain caused by the aftermath of the September 11 attacks economic downturns rising fuel costs and intensified competition.

2002-2005: US Airways underwent a comprehensive restructuring effort while operating under bankruptcy protection. This period involved cost reduction measures fleet optimization route adjustments labor negotiations and the development of a restructuring plan to improve efficiency and financial stability.

2005: US Airways successfully emerged from bankruptcy in March after implementing various restructuring measures and receiving financial support.

Merger with AA

However the airline’s story took a critical turn in 2013 when it announced its merger with AA. The merger between US Airways and American Airlines created the largest airline in the world at that time. The combined company retained the AA name and became a dominant player in the industry with an extensive network of routes increased fleet size and enhanced operational capabilities.

Following the merger the US Airways brand was gradually phased out while the airlines worked towards integration. Over time aircraft were repainted in the AA livery and operational processes were aligned under the AA brand. This is how US Airways closed its chapter.

US Airways legacy

Despite its struggles US Airways left a significant legacy within the aviation industry.

It pioneered several initiatives such as:

Hub-and-spoke system: US Airways played a pivotal role in popularizing and refining the hub-and-spoke system a network model used by many airlines today. The airline strategically established hubs at major airports from 1979 to 2011 such as Charlotte Philadelphia and Phoenix which served as central connecting points for passengers traveling to various destinations. The hub-and-spoke system allowed for efficient flight connections and increased route options for travelers.

Online reservations: US Airways was an early adopter of online reservation systems in the mid-1990s. It implemented online booking platforms allowing customers to make flight reservations at their convenience select seats and manage their travel itineraries through the airline’s website. This innovation significantly transformed the way in which passengers interacted with airlines and simplified the booking process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2dyZWF0c3BlY3VsYXRpb25zLzIwMjMvMTIvMDEvd2l0aC0yMC1nYWlucy10aGlzLW1vbnRoLWlzLWFsYXNrYS1haXItYS1iZXR0ZXItcGljay10aGFuLWFtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLXN0b2NrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With 20% Gains This Month Is Alaska Air A Better Pick Than American Airlines Stock?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2023/12/01/with-20-gains-this-month-is-alaska-air-a-better-pick-than-american-airlines-stock/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL2dyZWF0c3BlY3VsYXRpb25zLzIwMjMvMTIvMDEvd2l0aC0yMC1nYWlucy10aGlzLW1vbnRoLWlzLWFsYXNrYS1haXItYS1iZXR0ZXItcGljay10aGFuLWFtZXJpY2FuLWFpcmxpbmVzLXN0b2NrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Northern Virginia Electric Cooperative (NOVEC) lineworkers Blake Sparling and Mauricio Paz both of Prince William County left the comfort and convenience of Northern Virginia in October to bring some comfort and convenience to the villagers of Santa Isabel Guatemala.

They along with 16 fellow lineworkers from other U.S. electric co-ops were part of the United We Light effort the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) International initiative that brings electricity to rural communities around the world. The project was completed with support from the NRECA and Empresa Municipal Rural de Electricidad (EMRE) an electric co-op in Guatemala.

The lights are on for about 500 Santa Isabel residents for the first time ever. The team installed more than five miles of primary conductor transformers breaker boxes wired lights switches and electrical boxes. They also added service connections to about 115 residences including a school and church.

“Accessibility was tough” said Sparling. “There are no real roads” which led to broken-down trucks flat tires and vehicles that had to be rescued from the mud.

EMRE had erected the poles before the Americans arrived but there were no bucket trucks to get lineworkers to the tops of the poles. “We had to climb every pole” said Paz.

Sparling said they had to complete many of their tasks manually in humid conditions where the heat index reached 119 degrees. He said “It was exhausting” and it took several days to adapt to the environment.

Paz said it was great to work with the local lineworkers. “We knew the equipment by different names and we couldn’t really communicate but we figured it out. Everyone there had the same goal. We were all feeding off the same energy.”

While in Santa Isabel Sparling and Paz interacted frequently with the villagers. The children in particular were curious about the men and their work and Sparling at 6 feet 5 inches tall was a giant to them.

“It was a joy having the kids around” said Paz. The lineworkers made a seesaw for the children and joined in a game of soccer. When the crew flew their drone the children clustered around eager to view the footage on the controller’s screen.

The residents of Santa Isabel helped the United We Light effort where they could. They carried cables and brought the workers bags of peanuts fruit and coconuts to eat. Most speak a Mayan language — Q’equchi’.

Some Guatemalans who were objecting to presidential election results held some peaceful protests that caused disruptions to the United We Light project. Paz described the adventure as equal parts humbling emotional and frustrating. “At times it was a roller coaster. The uncertainty was the toughest not knowing what would happen the next day.”

NOVEC’s lineworkers made the most of their first few hours back home. Sparling said he immediately headed out to a comedy club in Washington. Paz said he was just grateful to get home to a good shower and to kiss his wife and three kids.

Both men said they would be first in line to sign up for another United We Light experience if offered the chance. Paz said “When we are able to restore power to people after a storm those people are happy and grateful but to be able to give power to folks who have never had it that was totally different.”

A joint investigation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the North American Electric Reliability Corp (NERC) found that Elliott was the fifth winter event in 11 years where blackouts threatened the electric grid.

One of the problems was that the wells in the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations which hold large reserves of natural gas froze at the height of the storm slashing production by more than half in some instances.

The plunging natural gas supply significantly reduced the pressure in interstate pipelines that supply New York City via its utility Con Edison.

Con Edison was forced to limit the supply of gas to some customers and bring online a liquefied natural gas plant.

Had it not taken those steps regulators concluded that Con Edison “could have faced an unprecedented loss of its entire system that in this worst case scenario would have taken months to restore” according to the assessment.

The outage would have left more than a million of the power company’s customers in New York City and nearby areas without heat “while the outside temperature was in the single digits for months.”

“We narrowly dodged a crisis last year. Had the weather not warmed up on Christmas Day it is highly likely that natural gas service would have been disrupted to New York City” said NERC president and CEO Jim Robb.

Regulators urged US Congress and state lawmakers to establish reliability rules for natural gas infrastructure covering cold weather preparedness regional coordination and critical infrastructure.

“Someone must have authority to establish and enforce gas reliability standards” said FERC chairman Willie Phillips stressing the need to protect fuel supply to natural gas-fired power plants during extreme cold weather.

The FERC and NERC also recommended better enforcement of standards technical review of outages to identify precautions improved communication between gas distributors and grid operators and studying the need for more gas infrastructure.

Elliott resulted in at least 28 deaths and left hundreds of thousands of people on the East Coast without power. Nearly two-thirds of the US was under extreme weather warnings leading to unexpected energy generation supply losses.

As the temperatures outside plunged and the demand for heat spiked 18 percent of the entire country’s gas generators failed either because of technical glitches or a lack of fuel.

The regulators’ 168-page report published last month notes that it was “especially disconcerting that it happened in the Eastern Interconnection which normally has ample generation and transmission ties to other grid operators that allow them to import and export power.”

Nearly a year after Winter Storm Elliot much of the US power grid is still at an increased risk of having insufficient energy supplies to meet higher demand in extreme conditions — a worrying prospect in light of forecasts predicting that this winter will be colder and snowier than the last in many parts of the US.

In a separate 2023-2024 Winter Reliability Assessment released by NERC on Nov. 8 the regulators warned that while power grids can handle normal winter conditions “any prolonged wide-area cold snaps will be challenging due to generator outages and fuel vulnerability.”

“Extreme cold weather events can cause electricity demand to deviate significantly from historical forecasts” said Mark Olson NERC’s manager of reliability assessments. “The growth of intermittent resources like solar generation on the distribution system significantly increases load forecasting complexity and uncertainty.”

“Once again we strongly recommend that operators take the necessary steps to prepare for winter” he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3Bsbi5vcmcvcG9zdC90ZW5uZXNzZWUtYmxhY2tvdXRzLXdpbnRlci0yMDIzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tennessee is vulnerable to winter blackouts. Here is a big reason why.,"Courtesy Tania Malréchauffé/Unsplash

Winter Storm Elliott was caused by a blast from the Arctic region. Temperatures dropped to -1 degrees in Nashville on Dec. 23 2022.

Listen

Last December the Tennessee Valley Authority said it was prepared to handle 34 gigawatts of demand. When an Arctic blast dropped temperatures right before Christmas demand peaked at about 33.4 GW.

But TVA failed to deliver the power it promised it could handle and the utility was forced to order blackouts. More than a dozen fossil fuel plants faltered and hundreds of thousands of Tennesseans lost power. It was the biggest test to date for TVA.

TVA says it is fixing the problem. But federal officials say the region remains vulnerable to power shortages — and while TVA can weatherize plants the fossil fuel system on which it relies extends past its control.

What happened last December?

By mid-December 2022 TVA knew severe weather was coming. TVA communicated the threat across the organization and committed all available generation. On Dec. 22 temperatures dropped more than 40 degrees in just five hours.

On Dec. 23 many cities in TVA’s seven-state region dipped below zero. By late morning TVA had 6.5 GW of unplanned outages equivalent to nearly 20% of peak demand according to a recent report by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or FERC.

TVA asked local power companies like the Nashville Electric Service to cut power by 10% through rolling blackouts.

The blackouts were needed because of lost fossil fuel generation. TVA could not fully operate 10 of its 17 gas plants three of its four owned coal plants and its one contracted coal plant in Mississippi.

(Note: TVA was also unable to generate power at one of its gas plants in Memphis shown in the image above as being in operation but TVA has since said that failure was caused by old age and not cold weather. Also the image does not show the Gallatin Fossil Plant a coal plant east of Nashville.)

What caused the power outages?

The FERC report examined the entire region of the Eastern U.S. affected by power outages during the December storm called Winter Storm Elliott and identified the top three causes. FERC estimated that mechanical and electrical issues caused 41% of outages while freezing issues caused 31% and gas fuel issues caused 20%. FERC noted that a “substantial majority” of generation loss from power plants occurred at temperatures above their documented minimum temperature thresholds.

Most power generation losses were related to gas the report shows following precedent: Fossil gas also called “natural gas” or methane gas has become the focus of scrutiny related to winter blackouts because gas has failed the most.

“Extreme cold weather events have repeatedly impaired the production gathering processing and transportation of natural gas” the FERC report says referencing several events like the deadly Winter Storm Uri in 2021.

Last year gas was the largest source of electricity in the U.S accounting for about 40% and could be as bad as coal in its contribution to climate change. It is a fossil fuel comprised mostly of methane a greenhouse gas that heats the planet about 80 times faster than carbon dioxide in a 20-year timeframe.

Gas plants are particularly vulnerable to outages because cold weather affects its entire supply chain including fracking sites pipelines compressor stations and power plants. Last December TVA reported an inadequate gas supply and insufficient pressure on pipelines in some locations.

Gas also overlaps with electricity as the gas system requires electricity to make electricity.

“We have an interconnected gas-electric system. What happens on one system does impact the other system” Mark Lauby the chief engineer at the North American Electric Reliability Corporation or NERC said at a meeting with FERC earlier this month.

Both the physical components of the fossil gas system and their interconnectedness with the wider energy system present serious challenges. TVA can weatherize its gas plants — the utility says it has spent $8 million in recent months to do just that — but does not control what happens further up the supply chain.

Federal officials have warned that there is no entity regulating the entirety of the fossil gas system at this time.

FERC Chairman Willie Phillips during a regular meeting this month said the energy industry needs “an organization that has responsibility and authority for the natural gas system reliability.”

How bad is the risk?

NERC estimated that Tennessee and a portion of surrounding states could fall about 5.7 GW short of capacity during a bad storm this winter — similar to last year.

“Natural-gas-fired generator availability and output can be threatened when the fuel supply is insufficient or when infrastructure is unable to maintain the flow of fuel. As Winter Storm Elliott demonstrated the rapid decline in natural gas production during periods of extreme cold weather can have wide-area consequences for the grid” NERC said in its reliability assessment for the upcoming winter season.

In the Southern U.S. utilities have not added much new generation since last year. “Forecasted peak demand has risen while resources have changed little in these areas since Winter Storm Elliot caused energy emergencies across the area in 2022” NERC said.

This year TVA added 1 GW of purchased power and 1.4 GW of new gas generation spokesperson Scott Brooks said.

TVA does plan to build a lot more generation in the next few years. Based on public announcements and the most recent budget most of that generation will be gas."

And the oil is only becoming more valuable — and important — as generative artificial intelligence bursts onto the scene.

Generative AI technologies are trained using large quantities of data so that the AI systems can identify and learn the patterns in the data enabling them to subsequently generate new content when queries match the observed patterns gleaned from training data.

Still for enterprise applications of AI within security-critical processes there is no such thing as too safe — making effective data governance and a compliant technical infrastructure both a must and a bottleneck.

Now a consortium of companies called the Data and Trust Alliance has developed data provenance standards for describing the origin history and legal rights to data.

Announced Thursday (Nov. 30) the new set of standards is intended to help enterprise businesses feel more comfortable and secure when embracing AI and building bespoke programs about the data being used.

“The standards are designed to be used both within a company and with the company’s ecosystem of data providers and data partners for use cases across the enterprise” the group said when announcing the standards. “They are less applicable to large language models trained with public web-scale datasets.”

The alliance is made up of more than two dozen companies including American Express Humana IBM Pfizer UPS Warby Parker CVS Health General Motors Mastercard Meta Nike the NFL and Walmart among others.

It comes as organizational leaders interested in capturing the change-the-game efficiencies AI offers are increasingly looking to gain further clarity on data lineage before making the jump and integrating AI solutions into their workflows.

Super-Specific AI Needs Super-Specific Data

More information more access to that information around the data being used in AI systems is a crucial way to give enterprise confidence in the innovation a shot in the arm.

For organizational decision-makers comprehending data lineage is essential for making informed decisions about AI integration. It provides a comprehensive view of how data flows through the organization offering insights into data quality security and compliance.

As PYMNTS has reported the generative AI industry is expected to grow to $1.3 trillion by 2032 but key to its success will be tailoring AI solutions by industry.

And key to tailoring AI solutions by industry is the availability of vast amounts of clean and structured industry-specific data for industry-specific LLMs to process.

Per the Data and Trust Alliance today’s data scientists spend almost 40% of their time on data preparation and cleansing tasks.

“Artificial intelligence is based on data” Prateek Kathpal president and CEO of SymphonyAI Industrial told PYMNTS in an interview posted Friday (Dec. 1). “The more data you have the better data you have the cleaner data you have then the better solution or a better output you’re going to get. And the better and more relevant the output the more actionable insights for better decision making you’re provided with.”

The end-to-end tracking of data as it moves through various stages of its lifecycle within an organization can include its origin transformation and every touchpoint it encounters until its final destination.

A Well-Organized and Efficient Data Pipeline

The success of AI models hinges on the quality of input data. By understanding data lineage employees tasked with owning AI initiatives can identify and rectify potential bottlenecks inconsistencies or inaccuracies in the data pipeline.

“When you ask people a lot of them don’t know much about AI — only that it is a technology that will change everything” Akli Adjaoute founder and general partner at venture capital fund Exponion told PYMNTS in an interview posted Thursday (Nov. 30).

“But if you go into a field where the data is real particularly in the payments industry whether it’s credit risk whether it’s delinquency whether it’s AML [anti-money laundering] whether it’s fraud prevention anything that touches payments … AI can bring a lot of benefit” he added.

The quest for clarity on data lineage is not just a technical detail but a strategic imperative. By ensuring data quality transparency risk mitigation and operational efficiency CEOs are laying the groundwork for a successful and sustainable integration of AI solutions into their workflows.

“In the payments industry we’ve had a very data-rich environment but we’ve operated in an insight-poor environment” Enigma Technologies CEO Hicham Oudghiri told PYMNTS Nov. 14.

A Boca Raton Financial Advisor owes nearly $400000 on his Amex Centurion Card. He is now being sued by American Express.

BY: LITIGATION DESK | BocaNewsNow.com

BOCA RATON FL (BocaNewsNow.com) (Copyright © 2023 MetroDesk Media LLC) — A Boca Raton man listed as an investment advisor with the Securities and Exchange Commission allegedly owes American Express $394658.68 charged to an Amex Centurion card. American Express is now suing him in Palm Beach County Circuit Court.

According to documents obtained by BocaNewsNow.com Geoffrey Deller of Blue Bayou Drive in the Lotus community of West Boca Raton submitted multiple checks in the amount of $99999.99 to Amex. They all bounced. So did one for $94658.70.

It was not immediately clear for how long Mr. Deller has had an apparent payment problem or what he may have spent $394658 on. We do know that he purchased his house for $983000 in August of 2021 and is not facing any other litigation in Palm Beach County.

The suit by American Express seeks a non-jury verdict. The good news for Deller: it appears roughly $30000 can be “paid over time.” It was not immediately clear if Deller had retained an attorney. Or a financial advisor.

AIG noted that the underwriter may offer the shares of common stock from time to time for sale in one or more transactions on the NYSE in the over-the-counter market through negotiated transactions or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale at prices related to prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices.

The offering is expected to close on December 5 2023 subject to customary closing conditions.

The sale comes less than a month after AIG sold 50 million shares of Corebridge to raise approximately $1 billion.

AIG launched an initial public offering of Corebridge in September 2022 pricing it at $21 per share. In the same year AIG had rebranded the parent company of its Life & Retirement business from SAFG Retirement Services to Corebridge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmxhdy5jb20vY29ycGNvdW5zZWwvMjAyMy8xMi8wMS9jYW5kaWRhdGUtd2hvLWFncmVlZC10by1iZWNvbWUtYWlnLWxlZ2FsLWNoaWVmLWJhY2tzLW91dC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Candidate Who Agreed to Become AIG Legal Chief Backs Out | Corporate Counsel,"Stripe Chief Legal Officer Patricia “Trish” Walsh who in September accepted an offer to become general counsel of insurance giant American International Group has rescinded her decision and will stay with Stripe.

Zaffino says in a statement: ‘The legal business and governance expertise that Rose Marie has demonstrated during her tenure including most recently as interim general counsel reaffirms that she is uniquely qualified for this leadership position. Rose Marie has played an instrumental role in the significant progress we have made in positioning AIG as a top-performing global insurer. I look forward to continuing to work closely with her.’

Glazer says in the announcement: ‘AIG is at an inflection point in its pursuit of excellence as a top-performing global company and our talented and dedicated legal compliance regulatory and government affairs teams will play an ever-important role in supporting high-quality outcomes. Partnering with our world-class colleagues across AIG’s businesses and operations we are aligned behind clear priorities and committed to advancing AIG’s progress.’",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MvaG9tZS8yMDIzMTEzMDM4NzY2OS9lbi9BSUctQW5ub3VuY2VzLUxhdW5jaC1vZi1TZWNvbmRhcnktT2ZmZXJpbmctb2YtQ29yZWJyaWRnZS1GaW5hbmNpYWwtSW5jLi1Db21tb24tU3RvY2vSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AIG Announces Launch of Secondary Offering of Corebridge Financial Inc.

There have been several bull and bear markets over the past 25 years and the bulls may be making another run. While high-flying growth stocks tend to attract more attention don't overlook strong dividend payers that can also be a valuable addition to your portfolio providing steady income along with long-term growth.

Among their number are real estate investment trusts (REITs) owners of income-producing property who by dint of their tax status are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income each year to shareholders.

Three good choices to consider are American Tower (AMT 0.38%) Prologis (PLD 1.09%) and Realty Income (O 0.18%). While in very different businesses each stand to be excellent long-term investments due to their consistent dividend payouts strong balance sheets and resilience to economic fluctuations.

The chart below shows the total return for all three REITs since American Tower went public in 1998 (Realty Income did so in 1994 and Prologis in 1991). Despite the relatively conservative nature of real estate investing all three of these companies have handily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past quarter century.

Let's take a look at each.

1. American Tower

American Tower holds a dominant position in global digital infrastructure growing its network of towers and more recently data centers and small cell antennas to about 225000 sites in 25 different countries.

The major mobile carriers dominate this infrastructure REIT's tenant list but thousands more customers also provide a steady cash flow with the sector's demand expected to be on the rise for years to come.

American Tower stock has jumped about 18% in the past month and now trades for about $201 per share but analysts give it a consensus target price of $228.60 pointing to room to grow. The current yield is about $3.2% and 12 straight years of dividend increases show the payout just might keep growing too.





2. Prologis

Prologis is the 1.2 billion-square-foot gorilla of warehouse space providing business-to-business and retail/online fulfillment space to about 6700 customers in 19 countries.

This industrial REIT's vast client list is anchored by reliable rent-payers like FedEx and Amazon and the demand for logistics infrastructure that exploded over the past decade should continue to keep its space and coffers full.



Prologis stock jumped about 14% in November and now trades at about $110 a share good for a yield of about 3.2%. Analysts give it a consensus target price of $139 a very nice potential upside to go along with 10 straight years of dividend increases including by an annualized 14% over the past three years.





3. Realty Income

Realty Income is the largest and perhaps best known of retail REITs and a poster child for dividend stocks with a record of 640 monthly dividends and 31 consecutive years of annual increases.

Realty Income now owns about 13000 rent-producing properties anchored by brand-name retailers. Industrial properties and casinos add to the mix and Realty Income just announced plans for the $9.3 billion acquisition of Spirit Realty Capital and its more than 2100 retail and industrial properties.



Realty Income stock has jumped about 11% in the past month but is still yielding a nice 5.7% at a share price of about $54 that analysts give a consensus target price of $60.90.





Ready to return to steady growth

These REITs are the biggest of their kind and are priced nicely for continued turnarounds from the year-over-year battering shown in the chart above.

With strong track records economic moats and exposure to secular demand trends they have promising long-term prospects -- with steady dividends along the way. For investors taking a buy-and-hold approach these three REITs warrant serious consideration.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8wMS9wb2xpdGljcy91cy13YXRlci11dGlsaXRpZXMtaGFjay9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFDaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMy8xMi8wMS9wb2xpdGljcy91cy13YXRlci11dGlsaXRpZXMtaGFjaw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Federal investigators confirm multiple US water utilities hit by hackers,"CNN —

Following a recent cyberattack at a Pennsylvania water utility federal officials have confirmed that multiple additional water utilities in the US running the same industrial equipment have been breached by hackers two people briefed on the matter told CNN.

The federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency briefed Senate and House staffers on the situation on Thursday and revealed that hackers had breached computers at “less than 10” water facilities in different parts of the US one of the sources told CNN. In each case the equipment targeted was the same Israeli-made computer system that allows machinery to communicate at water and other industrial facilities.

The incidents have not led to any disruptions at the water facilities or threatened drinking water but they have concerned US officials because they have required little skill to execute. The hackers have defaced computer screens at the water facilities in opportunistic low-level attacks one of the sources told CNN.

Later Friday US and Israeli authorities issued an advisory confirming that hackers had “accessed multiple US-based” water facilities that operate the Israeli-made equipment likely by breaking into internet-connected devices with default passwords. The US and Israeli government agencies blamed hackers affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a military branch of the Iranian government for the activity.

CNN has reached out to the Iranian Permanent Mission to the United Nations for comment.

The spree of hacks burst into public view a week ago when a water utility outside of Pittsburgh said that apparently pro-Iran hackers breached equipment that the utility uses to manage water pressure and displayed an anti-Israel message on the computer screen. The hacking group whose logo displayed on the screen has a history of pro-Iranian operations and appears to be conducting retaliatory attacks on Israeli-made equipment during the ongoing Israel-Hamas war.

The water utility Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa serves about 15000 people.

CISA and the FBI — along with private experts and water industry executives — have this week been scrambling to try to get water utilities to take their industrial equipment off of the internet before further hacks occur. One private industry expert Ron Fabela told CNN he found numerous cases of the exact same make and model of equipment that was compromised at the Aliquippa water authority that were sitting on the public internet.

Politico reported Tuesday that federal investigators were probing multiple hacks of water facilities in the wake of the Pennsylvania incident.

The Pittsburgh-area water utility has handed over the hacked equipment to the FBI and has been operating one of its pump stations in manual mode until it can replace the equipment general manager Robert J. Bible told CNN this week.

Bible told CNN Friday evening that he had heard there had been other water facilities targeted with the same hacking technique but did not have additional details.

Rep. Chris Deluzio a Democrat whose district includes the Aliquippa water authority said he received a classified briefing this week from federal officials on the water hack but declined to offer more.

“Our adversaries don’t care who runs critical infrastructure” Deluzio told CNN on Friday. “If they can get in through the weakest link — and [if] that’s a small municipal authority or a private vendor — that’s what they’re going to target.”

The US water sector which spans 150000 public water systems has often struggled to find the cash and personnel to deal with hacking threats.

“It should be a wakeup call” Deluzio said of the Aliquippa hack. “Our frontline cyber warriors in many cases … are the local officials who serve at places like water companies.”

Rendering courtesy U of A Community Design Center This bird blind tower is one component of the Framework Plan for a Riverine Commons and Institute. The plan developed by the U of A Community Design Center and its partners has won a 2023 American Architecture Award and received two honorable mentions in the 2023 Plan Award.

Two Arkansas-based projects designed by the U of A Community Design Center have won 2023 American Architecture Awards.

""The ARK: Rural Botanical Garden for Arkansas"" in Cherokee Village Arkansas and the ""Framework Plan for a Riverine Commons and Institute"" in Fayetteville each won a 2023 American Architecture Award.

The ARK features a new botanical garden and zipline part of an eco-tourism initiative and features woodland-only spaces with botanical rooms in clearings blending history and community event needs.

The Framework Plan integrates landscape restoration architecture and urban design to create a river education center visitor center fruit grove food gardens trails and heritage exhibitions. The Framework Plan has also won two Honorable Mentions in the 2023 Plan Awards.

The U of A Community Design Center directed by Steve Luoni since 2003 is an outreach center of the Fay Jones School of Architecture and Design. Luoni is also Distinguished Professor of Architecture and the Steven L. Anderson Chair in Architecture and Urban Studies at the university.

""Over the next several years every region in Arkansas will experience unprecedented economic development that will challenge capacity in their built environments — all planned in earlier eras"" Luoni said. ""We are focused on addressing these future needs and the kind of novel scenario thinking needed to pragmatically solve for interconnected community development issues. We are grateful that our work in urban design and planning for constituents statewide continues to attract outside recognition in the design disciplines.""

These projects were selected from a shortlist of more than 450 submissions from around the nation. Both The ARK and the Framework Plan were sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts.

THE ARK: RURAL BOTANICAL GARDEN FOR ARKANSAS

The ARK features a botanical garden and zipline for Cherokee Village a rural mid-century planned community in the Ozarks. The project is the centerpiece of the new hospitality/eco-tourism landscapes under development. Planting assemblages of legacy woodland-wildflower prairie that once dotted the managed pre-Columbian landscape of the region are recalled in this now woodland-only ecosystem. Clearings at the scale of urban blocks house a series of botanical rooms carved into the dense forest cover. Inverted pyramidical rooms encourage visitors to travel along the steep terrain paralleling the nearby Mississippian Mound Builder earthworks that landmark flatter terrain.

Perceptions of the wood-screened structures are constantly shifting between monumentality and transparency following the visitor's movement. Interactions among screened rooms organic plant assemblages steep slopes and forest cover create a parallax that simultaneously upholds and denies the garden's monumental scale. This place-based asset provides informal and formal event space that is currently missing in this community.

FRAMEWORK PLAN FOR A RIVERINE COMMONS AND INSTITUTE

The Framework Plan for a Riverine Commons and Institute focuses on redesigning the 98-acre wetland landscape at Dead Horse Mountain Road co-owned and managed by the Watershed Conservation Resource Center and the City of Fayetteville. The plan combines the restoration of landscapes and floodplains with architecture and urban designs to house a river education center and offices a visitor interpretive center a fruit and nut grove demonstration food gardens walking trails passive recreation facilities trails and heritage exhibitions. The programming celebrates the riparian-oriented cultures of local Native American African American and Euro-American subsistence settler populations through displays of reconstructed indigenous shelters and prototyped artifacts including a polyculture fruit and nut grove with indigenous plant assemblages and growing strategies.

The team developed the plan for a riparian wetlands landscape that operates at the intersection of anthropology ecology and design in developing a lasting and robust riverine knowledge base. The river institute raises awareness of the civilizing (or anthropogenic) processes harnessing riparian landscapes throughout different eras of local human occupation. The project team combined expertise in the ecological sciences anthropology/archeology architecture and landscape architecture/horticulture. This multi-disciplinary collaboration addresses the multiple challenges of design within human-dominant ecosystems.

The Framework Plan also received two honorable mentions in the 2023 Plan Award one each in the Culture Future category and in the Landscape Future category of this international awards program that recognizes excellence in architecture interior design and urban planning.

Mitratel a subsidiary of Telkom Indonesia said on Thursday it had acquired 803 towers belonging to Gametraco Tunggal worth IDR 1.75 trillion (US$112.6 million). Of those 241 towers are located on the island of Java while the remainder are outside of the island.

Mitratel President Director Theodorus Ardi Hartoko said that many telecoms players in Indonesia are looking to expand their market share outside of Java as demand for internet connectivity grows elsewhere in the archipelago.

“Of course we have to be at the forefront in helping their expansion” he said.

Apart from giving Mitratel more towers outside of Java the Gametraco deal also comes with an additional 1327 new tenants which will increase Mitratel’s tenancy ratio Hartoko added.

Meanwhile also on Thursday Mitratel revealed it had acquired 967.1 km of optical fibre from Power Telecom for IDR 85 billion.

Mitratel said the fibre has a billable length of over 1144 km which means the new fibre complements its tower business portfolio with a billable ratio of 1.18x.

Mitratel said the transaction was sourced from internal funds noting that it had budgeted a capex of IDR 7 trillion for 2023 58% of which had been absorbed by the end of the third quarter of 2023.

“This means that Mitratel has sufficient liquidity to finance tower and fibre optic expansion until the end of this year” the company said in a statement.

Earlier this month Mitratel reported profit growth of 16.6% year-on-year to IDR14 trillion in Q3 2023 while revenue increased 11.9% to IDR6.3 trillion. In that quarter Mitratel’s tower portfolio grew 5.8% year on year to 37091 towers while its optical fibre assets grew from 5872 km to 29042 km.

Hartoko said Mitratel’s expansion strategy will make it the largest digital infrastructure company in Asia Pacific.

Research firm Dgtl Infra said in September that Mitratel was the 13th biggest telecoms tower company in the world based on the number of towers. As of June 2023 Statista ranked Mitratel at #15 globally but also said it was the largest tower company in Southeast Asia."

This acquisition is expected to be completed in the second half of 2024 subject to necessary approvals.



Timely repairs and maintenance of aging water and wastewater infrastructure are essential to providing high-quality 24x7 services to customers. As part of the acquisition deal New Jersey American Water plans to invest more than $50 million to upgrade the aging water and sewer infrastructure in the next 10 years after the acquisition’s closure to provide high-quality sewer services to customers.



New Jersey American Water has been expanding its sewer service business in the state through systematic acquisitions. In October 2023 the company acquired Somerville Sewer System for $7 million which added nearly 3800 customers to its existing base.

Aging Industry Needs Investments & Consolidation

The aging of water and wastewater infrastructure and delays in essential upgrades are concerns for the industry. Per the American Society of Civil Engineers nearly 50000 community water systems and 16000 wastewater treatment systems in the United States are presently providing water solutions to customers. Some of the service providers are too small and have limited financial strength to carry out the essential costly repairs on time which leads to pipeline breakage and disruption of services and increases the possibility of contamination.



Fragmentation in the water and wastewater industry is a headwind. Large water utility companies continue to acquire small players to ensure the extension of high-quality services to customers and the investments required to upgrade old and acquired assets. Per the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency an investment of nearly $744 billion is necessary to maintain and expand water and wastewater services to meet demand over the next 20 years.



American Water Works through its subsidiaries is making systematic acquisitions and taking essential steps to upgrade the old infrastructure of its acquired assets. AWK has added 7900 customers till Sep 30 2023 by acquiring 14 companies.

The company’s pending acquisitions (as of Sep 30 2023) when completed will add another 88100 customers to its customer base. In 2024 the company aims to invest $3.1 billion with a major portion utilized for infrastructure improvements in Regulated Businesses. Over the long term AWK aims to invest in the range of $16-$17 billion in the 2024-2028 period and $34-$38 billion in the 2024-2033 period.



California Water Service Group CWT is also expanding operations through inorganic routes. It is expected to invest $360 million and $365 million in 2023 and 2024 respectively to upgrade its infrastructure and efficiently serve its expanding customer base. The company is also acquiring water and wastewater systems to expand operations.



Essential Utilities WTRG is also making acquisitions to expand its operations. Since 2015 it has expanded its utility operations by completing several water and wastewater acquisitions adding 129000 customers. The six acquisitions completed in 2023 added 11025 customers. At present there are five pending acquisition deals for a total purchase price of $354 million which when completed will add 211000 customers to its existing customer base.



Essential Utilities plans to invest $1.1 billion annually in the 2023-2025 period to strengthen its water and natural gas operations further.

The most telling characteristic for schools in Massachusetts is building age with facilities built in the 1960s and 1970s—nearly a third of the facilities tested—at the greatest risk for having dangerously high water lead levels.

There is no safe exposure level to lead. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP) recommends that schools and childcare facilities achieve the lowest lead levels possible with a goal of 1 ppb (parts per billion) or less often the lowest measurement that a laboratory can make. Childhood exposure can cause brain and nervous system damage slowed growth and development learning and behavioral problems and hearing and speech issues. (In fact today the Environmental Protection Agency announced proposed changes to the Lead and Copper Rule Improvements.)

The UMass study published in the American Water Works Association’s journal Water Science compared water lead-level data to a myriad of other characteristics that could influence these levels. “Is it certain types of fixtures? Is it certain types of buildings? Is it certain places? Is the chemistry of the water supply? Is there anything about the water treatment process?” says Emily Kumpel one of the study authors and assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at UMass Amherst.

Building age was the most important contributing factor for a few reasons. Legislation has been passed over the years to improve the safety of school water. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act Amendment in 1986 required the use of “lead-free” piping solder and flux in buildings. The definition of “lead-free” was then refined to more stringent levels in 2011.

Kumpel explains that there is a clear “before” and “after” around each of these time points: 50% of water samples from buildings constructed in 1986 and earlier had a water lead level of 2.1 ppb or higher and 13.7% of samples were greater than 15 parts per billion (or 0.0015 mg of lead per liter of water). After 1986 this declined so that half of samples had one ppb or less of lead and only 4.6% of samples had lead levels higher than 15 ppb.

Importantly these results represent water lead levels captured at “first draw” meaning the water had been stagnant in the pipes overnight. The pattern was similar when looking at samples after the pipes had been flushed for 30 seconds though less pronounced and with significantly lower lead levels after flushing.

Buildings constructed in the 1960s and 1970s—about 30% of all schools tested—were the most likely to have faucets water fountains or other fixtures with elevated water lead levels at first draw. Half of the first draw water samples taken from schools built in these decades had lead concentrations at or above 2.8 and 2.9 ppb respectively. Plus 16% of fixtures in 1960s buildings and 19.5% of fixtures in 1970s buildings had first draw levels over 15 ppb.

“That means that if you go into a facility built in the ’60s or ’70s and are the first one to get a glass of water in the morning or after a long school break you’d have a high chance of it having a dangerously high level of lead. However if the tap was flushed or had been used throughout the day this would drop substantially. This is why flushing or other remediation actions are important” Kumpel says.

Schools built in the 1950s and 1980s were also at slightly lower but still elevated risk.

Kumpel explains that this reflects certain construction decisions that were made in particular places at particular times. She also notes that trends in Massachusetts likely extend to other parts of New England that aren’t so geographically different and likely had similar building trends and best practices over the years.

The study’s data came from the Assistance Program for Lead in School Drinking Water a MassDEP and UMass Amherst water monitoring collaboration that began in 2016. This initiative now has information from more than 1500 schools and childcare facilities. “This publicly available large data set has been used for previous studies as well and provides a basis for facilities to take action to protect children’s health including applying for funding to install filtered bottle fill stations under the Massachusetts School Water Improvement Grant (SWIG) program” notes John Tobiason professor and head of the UMass Amherst civil and environmental engineering department who leads the UMass work in support of the MassDEP initiative and is a co-author on this paper.

Part of this current analysis of the results from MassDEP’s voluntary testing program included evaluating if the results may also serve a predictive purpose by identifying the risk factors for elevated water lead levels.

“As of last year around 60% [of Massachusetts schools] have had sampling done and reported to this public database but 40% have not though each month more schools and childcare facilities are testing” says Kumpel. “That was what we were trying to get at with this model: of those that haven’t yet tested can we prioritize the places that we might need to look at the most? Using these factors can we then predict where we should make sure to follow up?”

There are obvious implications for school administrators and legislators looking to enact environmental protections but what are the takeaways for parents?

“It’s close to home for me as someone with young children” says Kumpel. “But I’m also an engineer that works particularly on water distribution systems and providing safe tap water. This is why there are programs to test the water and report results that way you can have the assurance that there is monitoring. This is where as engineers we strive to achieve due diligence and transparency.” Where lead was detected technical assistance was offered for remediation actions including help in applying for the SWIG grants for water bottle filling stations she adds.

Massachusetts makes it particularly easy to do that. “Massachusetts has made the data available in a public database” she says. “See if your child’s school or daycare has been tested.

Feng “Frank” Xiao

Feng “Frank” Xiao associate professor of civil and environmental engineering was honored by the Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP) as the 2023 Emerging Investigator lecturer and presented a keynote address at the American Water Works Association’s (AWWA) Water Quality Technology Conference in Dallas last month.

Since 2017 the organizations have selected one distinguished young professor annually for this prestigious recognition. Xiao—among the researchers to warn of the dangers of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) or “forever chemicals”—joined Mizzou last year.

“I am glad to see our research efforts being embraced by peers and industry leaders alike signaling a solid collaboration between academia and the private sector toward better drinking water quality” he said.

Xiao’s AWWA presentation “Tackling PFAS in Water Infrastructure: Strategies for Treatment and Management in Water Systems” gave an overview of his ongoing work on innovative removal processes. He discussed the primary challenges in removing PFAs from existing water treatment facilities explored potential solutions and shared insights from his research on thermal treatments for degrading PFAS in waste media.

The AWWA conference is a cornerstone event in the water industry bringing together professionals and experts from academia and the private sector to address pressing water quality challenges.

AEESP is the largest non-profit academic organization in the environmental field in North America. AWWA is one of the world’s largest water association organizations with numerous members playing a significant role in the global water industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3VzL3VzLWp1c3RpY2UtZGVwYXJ0bWVudC11cmdlZC1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZS1mb3JlaWduLWhhY2tlcnMtYnJlYWNoLXBlbm5zeWx2YW5pYS13YXRlci1zdXBwbHnSAXdodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3huZXdzLmNvbS91cy91cy1qdXN0aWNlLWRlcGFydG1lbnQtdXJnZWQtaW52ZXN0aWdhdGUtZm9yZWlnbi1oYWNrZXJzLWJyZWFjaC1wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEtd2F0ZXItc3VwcGx5LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US Justice Department urged to investigate after foreign hackers breach Pennsylvania water supply,"Sens. John Fetterman and Bob Casey and Rep. Chris Deluzio have urged the U.S. Justice Department to investigate a cyberattack on a water authority near Pittsburgh.

The hack in Pennsylvania led to a temporary halt in pumping at a remote station affecting water pressure for nearby towns.

A national cybersecurity agency warns that attackers likely exploited weaknesses including poor security and internet exposure.

Three members of Congress have asked the U.S. Justice Department to investigate how foreign hackers breached a water authority near Pittsburgh prompting the nation's top cyberdefense agency to warn other water and sewage-treatment utilities that they may be vulnerable.

In a letter released Thursday U.S. Sens. John Fetterman and Bob Casey and U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio said Americans must know their drinking water and other basic infrastructure is safe from ""nation-state adversaries and terrorist organizations.""

PENNSYLVANIA WATER SUPPLY THREATENED AFTER HACKERS TARGET WATER AUTHORITY CYBERSECURITY AGENCY SAYS

""Any attack on our nation’s critical infrastructure is unacceptable"" Fetterman Casey and Deluzio wrote in their letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland. ""If a hack like this can happen here in western Pennsylvania it can happen anywhere else in the United States.""

The compromised industrial control system was made in Israel and a photo from the Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa Pennsylvania suggests the ""hackivists"" deliberately targeted that facility because of the equipment's link to Israel. The image of the device screen shows a message from the hackers that said: ""Every equipment ‘made in Israel’ is Cyber Av3ngers legal target.""

LARGE PENNSYLVANIA HEALTH CARE COMPANY HIT BY MALWARE ATTACK

A group using that name used identical language on X formerly Twitter and Telegram on Sunday. The group claimed in an Oct. 30 social media post to have hacked 10 water treatment stations in Israel though it is not clear if they shut down any equipment.

Casey's office said it was told by U.S. officials that they believe Cyber Av3ngers is indeed behind the attack. The Aliquippa water authority's chairman Matthew Mottes said federal officials told him that hackers also breached four other utilities and an aquarium.

""We’ve been told that we are not the only authority that’s been affected in the country but we are believed to be the first"" Mottes said in an interview.

Leading cybersecurity companies Check Point Research and Google’s Mandiant have identified Cyber Av3ngers as hacktivists aligned with Iran's government.

Since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war the group has expanded and accelerated targeting Israeli critical infrastructure said Check Point's Sergey Shykevich. Iran and Israel were engaged in low-level cyberconflict prior to the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel and cybersecurity experts have said they expected a rise in hacktivism in response to Israel’s attacks in Gaza.

The device breached in Pennsylvania was made by Israel-based Unitronics according to the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Known as a programmable logic controller it is used across a wide spectrum of industries including water and sewage-treatment utilities electric companies and oil and gas producers. It regulates processes including pressure temperature and fluid flow according to the manufacturer.

Unitronics has not responded to queries about what other facilities with its equipment may have been hacked or could be vulnerable.

Experts say many water utilities have paid insufficient attention to cybersecurity.

In Pennsylvania the hack prompted the water authority to temporarily halt pumping Saturday in a remote station that regulates water pressure for customers in two nearby towns. Crews took the system offline and switched to manual operation officials said.

The attack came less than a month after a federal appeals court decision prompted the Environmental Protection Agency to rescind a rule that would have obliged U.S public water systems to include cybersecurity testing in their regular federally mandated audits. The rollback was triggered by a federal appeals court decision in a case brought by Missouri Arkansas and Iowa and joined by a water utility trade group.

MULTISTATE CYBERATTACK DISRUPTS HOSPITAL SERVICES

The Biden administration has been trying to shore up cybersecurity of critical infrastructure — more than 80% of which is privately owned — and has imposed regulations on sectors including electric utilities gas pipelines and nuclear facilities. But many experts complain that too many vital industries are permitted to self-regulate.

In its warning Tuesday the U.S. cybersecurity agency said attackers likely breached the Unitronics device ""by exploiting cybersecurity weaknesses including poor password security and exposure to the internet.""

Mottes said he doesn't know how the device in Aliquippa was hacked but that he trusted the federal agency's judgment."
AMP,Ameriprise Financial,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL3RoZS1hc2NlbnQvcGVyc29uYWwtZmluYW5jZS9hcnRpY2xlcy8zMS1vZi1taWxsaW9uYWlyZXMtdGhpbmstdGhleXJlLW1pZGRsZS1jbGFzcy1oZXJlcy13aHkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,31% of Millionaires Think They're Middle Class. Here's Why,"A new study conducted by Ameriprise Financial shows that even when Americans have stashed sizable sums of money into their investment accounts they still might not see themselves as wealthy.

The financial group surveyed hundreds of Americans with $1 million or more in assets and found some surprising results including that 31% say they are ""middle class."" That may come as a shock to many Americans who have assets worth far less than that. Among the group of millionaires 60% say they are ""upper middle class"" and just 8% consider themselves ""wealthy.""

Why is there a difference in how the respondents defined their personal finances? It may be because everyone has a different perspective on what they think wealth is. The survey showed that most investors (85%) define wealth as financial security. Others thought wealth was being able to provide for themselves and their family while some said it was the ""freedom to do what I want.""

Definitions of the middle class vary

You might excuse the surveyed millionaires for not knowing whether they're middle class partly because there are many different ways to define it.

For example the Pew Research Center says someone is middle class if they have an annual household income that is two-thirds to double the national median income. The national median household income was $74580 in 2022 which means a middle-class household earns between $49720 and $149160 under this definition.

However the Brookings Institute says there are three separate definitions of the middle class and it doesn't even require a household to earn a specific income. Instead it says the term can refer to a person's professional credentials their culture or the amount of money they have.

How millionaires recommend building wealth

No matter how you define being middle class there are some practical lessons all of us can take from those who've accumulated substantial wealth. The Ameriprise survey respondents mentioned three top factors that helped them accumulate more than $1 million.

Financial planning and investing: 80% of respondents said this was the most important driver to building wealth. Thankfully you don't have to be an investing wiz to do well financially. Owning low-cost index funds in an investment account can help you build wealth over time.

80% of respondents said this was the most important driver to building wealth. Thankfully you don't have to be an investing wiz to do well financially.

But finding a few ways to boost your income can go a long way to helping you achieve your financial goals as well. Gig workers earn an average of $5700 annually and many of these jobs can be done in addition to your day job.

Gig workers earn an average of $5700 annually and many of these jobs can be done in addition to your day job. Living within your means: 69% said living within their means contributed to their financial success. The high cost of living has made this suggestion difficult for many Americans but it's a good reminder to keep tabs on your purchases. Debt payoff apps can be an excellent way to get your finances back on track if you need help.

You don't have to accumulate $1 million to be on the right financial track; for some people that might not be the best goal. Instead think of one financial goal you want to achieve. It could be stashing $1000 in your savings account putting money aside for buying a home or paying off your credit card balance. It all starts with setting a goal and creating a financial plan to get there.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbmVicmFza2FleGFtaW5lci5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8wMi8yMDI0LWNhdWN1cy1wcmltYXJ5LWFuZC1nZW5lcmFsLWVsZWN0aW9ucy1jb250cm9sbGVkLWJ5LWV4dHJlbWlzdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2024 caucus-primary and general elections controlled by extremists • Nebraska Examiner,"On Sept. 18 1787 the last day of the U.S. Constitutional Convention James McHenry a Maryland delegate asked Benjamin Franklin “well Doctor what have we got a republic or a monarchy?” Franklin’s reply “a republic if you can keep it” is profound. Not only does our democracy depend upon the supreme power of its residents and their elected representatives but for America to survive it depends upon its citizens to become actively involved in the selection of its elected delegates.

So what’s the problem? The Pew Research Center reports America’s voting turnout ranks an “underwhelming” 31st out of 50 countries that exhibit solid democratic traditions. While the 2020 presidential election had the highest voter turnout of the 21st century (66.7%) it’s sad that one out of every three people you meet on the street didn’t partake in our attempt to keep a republic.

In the past six general elections (2000-2020) the average turnout rate of registered voters for primary elections was 27% while the average turnout rate for general elections was slightly over 60%. This means more than half (55%) of general election voters did not vote in primary elections. For midterm primary elections it’s worse: about 80% of eligible voters do not partake in primary elections.

What’s the significance of this data? Low voter participation in caucus/primary elections means that a smaller subset of voters – most likely far left-wing crazies and far right-wing wackos – hoodwinked by candidate disinformation misinformation far-fetched promises propaganda and/or sinister political agendas may be playing an over-proportionate role in determining the final candidates.

A minority of the minority is selecting our political candidates

Let’s face it. We may be electing self-centered party-before-the-people politicians allegiant to their financial supporters simply because we’re not active – like Benjamin Franklin feared – in allelections. We have only ourselves to blame if we’re represented by less-than-desirable narcissistic divisive rude opponent-bashing retribution-oriented racist anti-bipartisan anti-trade anti-democracy anti-constitution and pro-authoritarian delegates.

Let’s review a couple of caucus/primary election examples:

Joe Biden ran for president three different times and didn’t win his first caucus/primary election until Feb. 28 2020 when he defeated Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in South Carolina. Biden was one of 22 candidates and has been a politician since 1971.

Donald Trump who has changed party affiliation five times was a presidential candidate in 2000 with the Reform Party. A 2020 study (Journal of Politics) revealed voters had the most difficulty assessing the ideology of Trump in the 2016 election out of all presidential candidates since 1972 and all contemporary legislators. Trump was one of 17 candidates seeking the GOP presidential nomination.

Was Mr. Biden and/or Mr. Trump the best candidate for his respective party or the winner only because a small subset of rabid fanatical Democrats or rabid extremist Republicans voted while the majority of D and R voters didn’t partake in the caucus/primary election?

Americans aren’t taking the caucus/primary and general election process seriously

What can you do to help America remain a democracy and select the best candidates? Be proactive. Go to www.270towin.com’s “2024 presidential election calendar” to find out the precise date of your caucus/primary election and vote. Next mark your calendar to also vote on Nov. 5 2024.

Officials within your political party of preference as well as your county and state auditor can assist with any voting inquiry.

The first of 15 caucus and 53 primary elections is scheduled for Jan. 15. Heed the words of Thomas Jefferson: “We do not have government by the majority. We have government by the majority who participate.”

Be in the majority by voting in the caucus/primary and general elections or don’t complain about the religious cultural and political zealot-elected politicians we must endure for another two to four years who purposely could be seeking office to change America from a republic to a monarchy.",,,,,,,,,

A new type of targeted immunotherapy drug shrank tumors in about one in three people with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) the most aggressive form of lung cancer according to results from a clinical trial. The findings are encouraging because little progress has been made in treating advanced SCLC experts said.

Many people with SCLC respond to initial treatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy. But the cancer usually progresses despite additional treatment with most of these patients dying within weeks or months.

The early-stage clinical trial tested two different doses of an experimental drug called tarlatamab in people with SCLC whose cancer had progressed after at least two previous types of treatment. Many people in the study had already received at least three different treatments.

In the trial tumors shrank in 40% of people given 10 mg of tarlatamab every 2 weeks and in about 32% of people who received a 100 mg dose.

Furthermore in more than half of all patients whose tumors shrank with tarlatamab the treatment kept the cancer at bay for at least 6 months—and in many it did so for 9 months or longer.

This last finding was especially noteworthy said Anish Thomas M.D. of NCI’s Center for Cancer Research who studies SCLC but was not involved in the trial.

“This is probably one of the most promising treatments being tested in small cell lung cancer right now” Dr. Thomas said. The new findings are “hopeful for patients and the people who treat them especially since this is such an aggressive disease with very few advances in treatment since the 1980s” he continued.

Results of the trial—known as DeLLphi-301 and funded by Amgen the company that makes tarlatamab—were presented October 20 at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) in Madrid and published the same day in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).

The new findings “support the use of tarlatamab in these previously treated patients” said the trial’s senior investigator Luis Paz-Ares M.D. Ph.D. of Hospital Universitario 12 de Octubre in Madrid who presented the results at the ESMO meeting.

The findings are “encouraging” agreed Pilar Garrido M.D. Ph.D. of Hospital Universitario Ramón y Cajal in Madrid who spoke about the trial at the ESMO meeting but was not involved in it. However she noted that patients need to be hospitalized to manage potentially serious side effects when they first receive the drug which poses logistical challenges to its use.

Dr. Garrido also noted the need for more data on the effectiveness of tarlatamab against SCLC that has spread to the brain and for a biomarker that can predict which patients will respond to the drug.

According to Dr. Paz-Ares the manufacturer of tarlatamab has already launched a large clinical trial comparing tarlatamab with standard chemotherapy in people with SCLC that has come back after one initial treatment.

Tarlatamab harnesses T cells to destroy small cell lung cancer cells

Tarlatamab is a type of immunotherapy known as a bispecific T-cell engager or BiTE. These two-armed drugs simultaneously latch onto tumor cells and immune cells called T cells. By bringing T cells and cancer cells close together they help the T cell recognize and destroy the cancer cell.

The arm of tarlatamab that targets small cell lung cancer cells attaches to a protein called DLL3. This protein is normally located inside cells but is often present at high levels on the surface of SCLC cells where it can be recognized by tarlatamab.

That makes DLL3 “a very attractive target in SCLC” Dr. Garrido said.

The trial enrolled more than 200 people with advanced or extensive-stage SCLC that had progressed or was no longer responding to treatment. All of the participants had previously been treated with chemotherapy and many had also been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor a different type of immunotherapy drug. All participants had received at least two prior therapies and one-third had received three or more.

The study team analyzed the response to tarlatamab in 100 participants who received 10 mg of tarlatamab by infusion every 2 weeks and another 88 who received 100 mg every 2 weeks. An additional 34 patients on the 10-mg dose were included in the analysis of side effects.

The 40% response rate (tumor shrinkage) seen in the 10-mg group “far exceeded” the 15% response rate that has historically been seen in people treated with standard therapies for SCLC that has relapsed Dr. Paz-Ares and his colleagues wrote in NEJM.

Furthermore 30% of those patients who responded to the drug had responses lasting at least 9 months. That finding is “exciting” Dr. Thomas said because the cancer usually grows so rapidly.

The median time that people in the 10-mg group lived after starting on tarlatamab was 14.3 months compared with 6–12 months with current treatments. Researchers are still following the trial participants to learn more about tarlatamab’s side effects and its impact on how long people live.

Based on the initial results of DeLLphi-301 the lower (10 mg) dose of tarlatamab will be used in future clinical trials Dr. Paz-Ares said.

Common and potentially serious side effects of tarlatamab

The side effects of tarlatamab were generally “manageable” Dr. Paz-Ares said and only about 3% of patients in the study stopped treatment entirely because of side effects. In addition 13% of people in the 10-mg group and 29% in the 100-mg group had to temporarily pause treatment have their dose reduced or both due to side effects.

The most common side effect of tarlatamab was cytokine release syndrome a potentially life-threatening reaction in which inflammation spreads throughout the body. Other common side effects included decreased appetite fever and anemia.

About one-third of the patients experienced severe side effects including serious cases of cytokine release syndrome. Severe side effects were more frequent in those receiving the higher dose of tarlatamab.

Most cases of cytokine release syndrome were “manageable and typically treated with supportive care” such as intravenous fluids and drugs to control fever and inflammation Dr. Paz-Ares said. However one person in the 10-mg group died from respiratory failure resulting from treatment.

Another potentially serious side effect of tarlatamab is ICANS (immune effector cell−associated neurotoxicity syndrome) which includes a host of neurological effects such as severe confusion attention problems tremor and muscle weakness. ICANS was more common in patients in the 100-mg treatment group and led one patient in each dose group to stop treatment entirely.

Both ICANS and cytokine release syndrome are commonly seen with immunotherapies that activate T cells to kill cancer cells including other BiTEs and CAR T-cell therapy.

Challenges concerns and questions remain

Dr. Thomas noted that the trial was not designed to compare tarlatamab with standard therapy for SCLC. “But there is strong historical data on how quickly the disease progresses with standard therapy.”

Another issue he said is that current practice calls for treating all patients with extensive-stage SCLC with chemotherapy plus an immune checkpoint inhibitor at the time of diagnosis. However about one in four people in the trial had not been treated with an immune checkpoint inhibitor. So it would be good to know how well tarlatamab works specifically for people whose cancer has come back despite previous immunotherapy he explained.

Possible side effects are also a concern. There were few severe cases of cytokine release syndrome in the trial and most occurred after the first or second dose of tarlatamab. Still the potential risk of side effects with early doses “is an important consideration” Dr. Thomas said because patients had to be hospitalized for a couple of days as a precaution when receiving each of the first two or three infusions of tarlatamab.

In addition people had to be in generally good physical condition to participate in the trial and the impact of potentially serious side effects could be greater in those who are sicker he continued.

For all these reasons Dr. Thomas said it will be important to know “how we can best manage side effects such that we don’t need to admit patients to the hospital and how we can anticipate prevent and treat side effects.”

He also pointed out that some patients died within 6 weeks after their treatment began before the study team could assess if the deaths were due to worsening of the cancer. And “we need to better understand whether these early deaths were due to side effects” he said.

Finally Dr. Garrido said another challenge is identifying biomarkers that can predict which patients are most likely to respond to tarlatamab. The research team looked at DLL3 on tumor cells as a potential biomarker but whether a person responded to the drug did not appear to be linked to having DLL3 in their tumors the study team reported.

“Despite the many challenges” Dr. Garrido said the results “offer renewed hope to our patients.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vcGhhcm1hcGhvcnVtLmNvbS9uZXdzL21zZC1hbWdlbi1iYWNrLXBhdGllbnQtZGF0YS1zcGVjaWFsaXN0LWN1bG1pbmF0aW9uLWJpb9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,MSD Amgen back patient data specialist Culmination Bio,"The venture capital arms of MSD and Amgen have provided $10 million in funding to Culmination Bio a Utah start-up that aims to build the largest disease-agnostic patient data resource for R&D purposes.

Culmination Bio is collating more than 40 years of biospecimen data that is paired with electronic health records (EHRs) and according to the company makes recruitment for pharmaceutical research “almost instantaneous”.

The funding is being provided by Merck Global Health Innovation Fund (Merck GHI) run by MSD (known as Merck & Co in North America) and Amgen Ventures and will be used to expand the data resource and commercial growth.

Culmination Bio started operations earlier this year as a spin-off from Intermountain Health a non-profit health system based in Salt Lake City that serves patients and communities in Utah Idaho Nevada Colorado Montana Wyoming and Kansas.

Its anonymised cloud-based platform provides access to omics-level data and access to a growing physical library of samples provided by five million-plus patients that can be harnessed for diagnostic and therapeutic development and other forms of medical research according to the company.

It says the resource tackles a key issue for the biopharma sector namely access to longitudinal biological and clinical patient data which can take life sciences and biotech companies months to collect and process. Along with rapid access to retrospective patient data it can also provide faster access to thousands of prospective patients for studies.

“With support from our investors Culmination Bio is raising the bar for healthcare innovation” said Lincoln Nadauld president and chief executive of Culmination Bio.

“On top of our existing longitudinal patient data we are adding over 300000 biospecimens to our data lake each year” he added. “Because of this we have the ability to quickly identify unique patient cohorts from our vast data lake that can speed up critical research leading to novel discoveries.”

While there is a growing number of large-scale omics resources being made available to researchers the integration of longitudinal data on symptoms co-morbidities and other treatments – as well as physical samples – is less common. Another example of a resource that draws on longitudinal data is the UK Biobank which released its full dataset earlier this week.

Merck GHI managing director David Runib said Culmination Bio’s platform “provides collaborators with access to uniquely rich de-identified clinical datasets” while Amgen Ventures' head of R&D David Reese said it will “help to accelerate the journey from bench to bedside.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9ycy5jb20vaWJkLWRhdGEtc3Rvcmllcy9hbWdlbi1jbGVhcnMtdGVjaG5pY2FsLWJlbmNobWFyay1oaXR0aW5nLTgwLXBsdXMtcnMtcmF0aW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amgen Clears Technical Benchmark Hitting 80-Plus RS Rating,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.investors.com/ibd-data-stories/amgen-clears-technical-benchmark-hitting-80-plus-rs-rating/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9ycy5jb20vaWJkLWRhdGEtc3Rvcmllcy9hbWdlbi1jbGVhcnMtdGVjaG5pY2FsLWJlbmNobWFyay1oaXR0aW5nLTgwLXBsdXMtcnMtcmF0aW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1tbS1vbmxpbmUuY29tL2hvbWUvY2hhbm5lbC9yeC1ydW5kb3duLWZkYS1hbWdlbi1zcHlyZS1hbmQtbW9yZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rx Rundown: The FDA Amgen Spyre Therapeutics and more,"New hires:

Trinamic is famous for their stepper motor driver chips which we see often in 3D printers XY gantries and other robots that need fast motion control.

Stepper motors are commonly used when we need continuous rotation for linear movement through a rack and pinion. We’ve got huge steppers in our pick and place machine and most makers are going to be familiar with them in CNC devices like laser cutters 3D printers or milling machines – servos will be controlling the X Y and Z axes as well as any extruder.

And if you have one of these devices you know they can be loud and slow: in order to get good precision from a stepper we need to micro-step so that instead of a standard 200 steps per rotation we get 16*200 or 256*200.

Microstepping gets us that beautiful precision but adds a ton of noise because now there’s a PWM signal that is vibrating the motor. That’s where Trinamic’s StealthChop2 secret sauce comes in:

The StealthChop chopper modulates the current based on the PWM duty cycle resulting in a perfect current sinewave with straight crossing of the zero-current level.

The constant PWM frequency minimizes current ripple and by extension any Eddy current that may be found in the stator reducing power loss and increasing efficiency. The StealthChop chopper also removes variations of the chopper frequency or frequency jitter so that only the commanded variations remain. Thus at a 50% PWM duty cycle the current is actually zero. The result of all this is silent stepper motor operation at a standstill and at low to moderate speeds.

We’ve covered Trinamic’s TMC2226 stepper driver before on EYE ON NPI and that chip mimic’d the common configuration for stepper motor drivers: set the microsteps with GPIO and then use a DIRection and STEP pin. That makes it easy for integration with any hardware you just need some GPIO pins but it means that you have to do the motion control yourself. And once you have 2 or 3 motors motion control code can get really complicated: you have to tune and configure ramp ups from idle to fast run and back down so there isn’t any jerky motion. What’s really cool is that the TMC5240 has built-in motion-control! You set some configurations and then can tell it what position or velocity to achieve and the microstepping is done for you. It even handles encoder reading mechanical stall detection and end-stop switch interrupts for you so you don’t slam into the side of the machine by accident.

To do this the TMC5240 has a full register and command set that can be controlled with SPI or UART – with UART there is node addressing required but perhaps this is easier to integrate with low-pin microcomputers. For both commands are sent for configuring everything from stall current to motion control to individual steps to temperature reads.

Speaking of which: the TMC5240 come in two packages: QFN and TSSOP. TSSOP has a big thermal pad at the bottom for better dissipation QFN is smaller. With either use plenty of vias a 4-layer design with dedicated 2 oz copper ground planes to keep the motor driver cool: these can handle 5-36V at up to 2A per leg so they are throwing a lot of current around.

You can pick up bare TMC5240 chips basic breakout boards and eval boards. Since you have to use the SPI/UART protocol to communicate we recommend checkout out the pyTrinamic library which has added support to the TMC5240 so you can hit the ground running / stepping.

Order up some of these silent stepper drivers today and you’ll get them in hand by tomorrow afternoon you’ll save tons of time on your next robotic or mechatronic project thanks to the tons of built-in capabilities on the TMC5240!

A practice improvement project at a Texas hospital led to decreases in chest tube duration hospital length of stay and readmissions for patients who had a pulmonary lobectomy. Credit: American Association of Critical-Care Nurses

An initiative at a Texas hospital contributed to reductions in chest tube duration hospital length of stay and readmissions for patients with lung cancer who had a pulmonary lobectomy according to new research published in Critical Care Nurse.

A multidisciplinary team from the department of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center Houston undertook the initiative to determine if a digital air leak detection device could better pinpoint when a patient no longer needs a chest tube due to an air leak after lung cancer surgery.

The article titled ""Use of a Digital Air Leak Detection Device to Decrease Chest Tube Duration"" describes how the project helped standardize management of air leaks improve patient safety and ensure consistent care and outcomes.

Co-author Carla Patel DNP APRN ACNP-BC is an advanced practice nurse in the unit where these patients typically receive care.

""We identified short-term long-term and impact goals for the project with an eye toward sustainability and embedding it into routine care"" she said. ""We took a conservative approach with a low threshold for airflow to avoid complications and further build trust in the new process.""

Members of the thoracic surgery team assess patients' chest tubes for postoperative air leaks and quantifying the results with analog devices may vary between clinicians. Identifying when air leak cessation occurs is a critical step toward chest tube removal which has a direct impact on the patient's hospital length of stay.

When new guidelines issued by the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Society and the European Society of Thoracic Surgeons in 2018 recommended use of a digital device for air leak detection as part of chest drain management the surgical group took steps to methodically incorporate such devices into patient care.

The project began with an extensive literature review particularly of studies with randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. This prior research supported the decision to move forward with the proposed project.

In addition the evidence indicated that use of a digital air leak detection device in patients who have undergone pulmonary lobectomy can lead to quicker recognition of air leak cessation earlier chest tube removal a decrease in hospital length of stay and lower overall costs.

With the potential benefits supported by evidence the research team developed a pilot project to attempt to replicate the results using a single digital device and a small group of patients who would benefit the most from the resource.

Every patient who undergoes a lobectomy may not require a digital device so the final patient population consisted of 25 admitted patients who had an initial pulmonary lobectomy and still had an air leak on postoperative day three. They were admitted over a span of 10 months providing a good representation of the practice.

When outcomes from the study population were compared with the historical data of 259 patients admitted over a two-year period prior to implementation (Jan. 1 2018 through Dec. 31 2019) the research team found significant differences:

56% of patients in the digital device group had their chest tubes removed a day sooner than those in the traditional device group.

72%t of patients in the digital device group were discharged a day earlier than those in the traditional device group.

92% of eligible patients had their chest tubes removed when the criteria was initially met.

Readmissions for the digital device group were zero while 10 readmissions were recorded in the traditional device group.

Based on the project findings the team created a chest tube management algorithm to standardize use of the digital air leak device for this patient population. Ongoing education about the algorithm was integrated into orientation for new team members and four additional digital devices were purchased.

Designed with critical insight from Ansys' multiphysics simulation solutions the NuScale SMR can safely supply carbon-free energy for electrical generation district heating water desalinization commercial-scale hydrogen production and other process heat applications.

NuScale used Ansys thermal and structural analyses solutions as part of NuScale's process for designing a fully passive safety system in which reactors will shut down and self-cool without any operator or computer action AC or DC power or the addition of water — a groundbreaking development.

NuScale engineers use Ansys solutions to determine velocities and temperatures for conjugate heat transfer and assess thermal stress and dynamic vibration. Informed by past challenges in the nuclear industry NuScale engineered its design to mitigate or eliminate safety issues.

The NRC's approval of NuScale's design allows utilities to leverage the already approved product when applying for a combined license to build and operate a nuclear power plant. NuScale expects to deploy its SMR technology in the U.S. and Europe by the end of the decade advancing nuclear energy solutions globally and across industries. The SMR will also benefit other sustainable energy solutions. For example NuScale's technology can provide the process heat energy at the conditions needed to cost-effectively chemically separate hydrogen from oxygen at scale to create green hydrogen — the cleanest form of hydrogen energy.

""NuScale is revolutionizing the energy industry by creating a power source that is smarter cleaner safer and cost competitive"" said Carl Fisher chief operating officer at NuScale Power.

What is the trilemma facing the energy industry?

As businesses organisations and governments all over the world put more and more effort into decarbonising the economy the energy industry faces a trilemma which can be broken down into three main pillars. Firstly it needs secure affordable and scalable energy to serve a growing population. Secondly that energy must be delivered converted and consumed more efficiently. And thirdly there is a need for new cleaner energy sources to support growth whilst replacing the widespread use of fossil fuels.

Do you think the current conversation around decarbonisation takes into account all three pillars of the trilemma?

The conversation surrounding decarbonisation can often be too narrow which risks neglecting the wider trilemma. Conversations can be dominated around potential solutions like ‘banning all fossil fuels’ which doesn’t take into account how complicated of an issue this is. If we are to succeed in providing robust reliable and affordable energy to everyone on the planet each pillar of the trilemma needs to be addressed.

For example if we look at the first issue there is the need to significantly increase the number of people who have access to electricity. Although an additional one billion people have been given access to electricity in the past few decades there are still around one billion people worldwide who do not have access to electricity. Additionally there is the issue of efficiency – currently around 65% of the energy that is sourced converted and consumed worldwide is wasted through inefficiencies.

So before we even look at the third pillar of the trilemma – developing a new cleaner energy source – there are significant things that can be done to improve the situation in the short term and increase the energy we currently supply through a big improvement in efficiency.

In this endeavour digital engineering is making great strides forward. The application of digital technologies to engineering design simulation optimisation and the operation of systems and processes across the whole life cycle of a product is making a significant contribution to energy efficiency and sustainability – and its contribution will only increase over time.

What can be done in the short term if we are to achieve our net-zero goals?

In the short term whilst we are in a transitional period where new technologies and energy sources are being discovered and developed improving energy efficiency in all products and processes is the best way to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. If efforts are focused on this area it could reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by up to 40% which would go a long way to helping us achieve our short-term net-zero ambitions. Currently 31% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions footprint comes from converting fossil fuels into electricity and heat; of that electricity a massive 45% is used in electrical motors in isolation. This means that currently 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions produced by humans come from electric motors. This is particularly significant as the global transportation sector is currently embarking on a vast electrification effort meaning that the use of electric motors is set to exponentially increase in the coming decades. As a result any efficiency that can be improved in electric motors could reduce global emissions by a few percent. Although that may sound small this would be a huge win for the planet as this solution is made up of many smaller percentage reductions in the aggregate.

How can digital engineering be employed in the design process to improve sustainability?

It is crucial to consider sustainability right from the off in the design process. This is because the majority of a product’s cost and environmental impact are locked in during the development and design cycle. One such decision that is critical to the overall impact that any product may have is that of materials selection. The materials that are used determine weight and therefore overall efficiency but also the recyclability. This is where the extensive use of digital engineering is pivotal. Firms are able to use digital engineering to input the exact properties of countless materials to be used in their simulations that are done at the beginning of the lifecycle. This means they get full insight into the most energy-efficient and cost-effective materials to use. Once the materials are chosen further simulations can be done to determine the optimal shape and makeup of a product again reducing material usage but critically without reducing strength. All of this works together to make a product that is more efficient in the first instance but also goes a long way to improving the overall life cycle of the product including having less material to recycle at the end of the lifecycle thus reducing energy consumption even further.

How can digital engineering be employed as the energy industry transitions to a more digital future?

On our path to a more sustainable future there are many new technologies that will be employed. The evolution of technologies such as the Internet of Things and 5G communications are driving the digital transformation of the industry as a whole and will play a crucial role moving forward. However the challenge comes with regards to energy assets and infrastructure that were commissioned long ago well before the explosion of the digital age. A big component of shifting the entire industry forward will be installing sensors actuators and communication devices so they can all be incorporated into the Internet of Things and this again is where the extensive use of digital engineering will be critical. It will allow a digital thread to be created that links all assets old and new into a single system that can be monitored by digital twins. Digital twins are a virtual replica of a real-world asset that allows engineers to understand how that asset will work in any given scenario. The use of digital twins allows teams to optimise efficiency reliability durability and real-time performance – all absolutely crucial to ensuring the long-term sustainability of any given product.

“We are present all around the globe but we are well-known to few” explains Chief Technology Officer Janne Kuivalainen. “Our ambition is to become our customer's preferred choice partner in decarbonisation and we want to create long-term value for our stakeholders customers employees shareholders and partners as the global leader in energy efficiency.”

Kuivalainen began working in the hydroelectric power plant business with ABB where he learned about the merits of dynamic optimisation of energy production and that high reliability and availability are key drivers for success.

“Energy production optimisation started to raise its head in the 1990s specifically for those companies that owned both power plants and factories consuming the electric energy. They started to look at the dynamic optimisation of electricity production and consumption. This is a reality today with distributed energy production.”

Kuivalainen also explored the early days of the industrial ethernet before joining Vacon Plc in 2005 which he found to be an exciting journey with the growth of versatile and dedicated solutions. Kuivalainen was the Global Head of Research and Development when Vacon was acquired by Danfoss.

Now the biggest challenge in Kuivalainen’s role is ensuring an effective and efficient working environment from the CEO’s office to the factory floor.

“We are very aware that we have had great success in working effectively and efficiently across our teams and with our people to help all of us understand the business better every day.

“I want to emphasise that next to the leaders we need top-notch key-knowledge experts who are able to then pick up the right priorities organise efficiently and be inspirational and motivational to their surroundings.”

So far Kuivalainen’s proudest achievement has been scaling and organising electrification businesses.

“We have a fast-emerging business in electrification” he explains. “I set up a dedicated team with a startup mentality in 2019 to make room for specific exploration. The green transition has been gathering momentum in recent years and following the ambidexterity principles for businesses our team was able to become a business unit in the beginning of 2023.”

Net zero pathways and software engineering create energy efficiency

Danfoss Group has one of the world's strongest portfolio components for decarbonising the three most emission-intensive sectors: industry transport and buildings.

Danfoss Group committed to reducing its emissions to 46.2% of the absolute scope of Scope One by 2030 2019 being the base year. The company has also committed to reducing absolute Scope Three emissions by 15% in the same timeframe.

“We have decided that to reduce our Scope One and Two to zero by 2030 we must use energy-efficient measures reuse excess heat from the process and source renewable energy.”

As a last resort the company will offset its emissions.

Danfoss Group has a three-step approach: Reuse Reduce and Recirculate which Kuivalainen views as a method of medicine. The company is introducing the Danfoss circularity framework (Rethink Reduce Recirculate) as an integral part of its new product development. By 2030 Danfoss’ ambition is to apply it to all product development.

According to Kim Fausing Danfoss President and CEO of Danfoss Group “A third of the reduction needed in energy-related CO2 emissions this decade according to the IEA Net Zero by 2050 scenario must come from improvements in energy efficiency. The good news is that the solutions are there to improve energy efficiency in all sectors. We don’t need to wait. We need action because the greenest energy is the energy we don’t use.”

It is not about how much new green energy can be produced but how the company can use the energy it has in a much more efficient way. Danfoss Drives is a part of one very public reference which is its Project Zero—a public-private partnership in the south of Denmark.

“Since 2007 Project Zero has been able to cut 50% of emissions in the city of Sonderborg. That's a reduction from 700 tonnes to 339 tonnes of CO2 from 2007 to 2020.”

Software engineering in the age of digitalisation cybersecurity and IoT

Software engineering is not what it used to be. Digitalisation comes with industrial internet connectivity cybersecurity and data privacy which is also an important topic in the business environment. Kuivalainen is tasked with working out how to improve and manage this in a sustainable way.

“We have applied DevOps to the embedded systems. The IT industry has been using DevOps in development and integrated operations for quite a while.”

The company has now applied that to the embedded software which requires hardware-software integration so that Danfoss Drives can carry out testing seamlessly.

Danfoss Drives has been using solutions offered by its partner Typhoon HIL in the hardware-in-the loop (HIL) testing. Continuous integration and delivery requires investments in testing.

“We applied robotic process automation for testing and lifecycle requirements for example due to cyber security which meant that we needed to create an architecture that has these elements built in so that it's easy to maintain.”

Kuivalainen knows that Danfoss Drives can increase the performance on a continuous basis for years to come.

“If I look back to the product itself we have decided on more extensive use of modelling and simulation. This depends very much on the different physics like thermal vibration and EMC simulations.”

Danfoss Drives can generate the software itself for the product but also the simulation models needed for digital twins at the same time from the same source code.

“We envisioned the benefits to ourselves regarding simulation and modelling-based engineering. It has been great to see how we can use it with our customers now.

“Requirements by both customers and regulators will change regarding embedded software. Cybersecurity and data management requirements and regulation will also continue to develop.”

Kuivalainen anticipates that updates will become more common over the lifecycle of a product and they need to be controlled safe and secure.

“I see that the best practices of it for example the DevOps type of operating model is coming into the development of embedded systems as well. It's a reality for us today.”

Electrification in manufacturing sustainability and energy

Danfoss Drives electrification solutions can be used across the manufacturing sustainability and energy sectors. The company has firm ESG targets ranging from implementing Net Zero to a radical reduction of greenhouse gases.

“We found out there are tools and very much our own products for this readily available which are financially profitable. Financing of companies is becoming increasingly dependent on how well they do on their ESG journey.”

In manufacturing industries Danfoss Drives brings the solutions in electrification to the site level enabling tangible savings in decentralised conveyor systems providing drive solutions for local battery-energy storage systems and advanced drive arrangements.



Danfoss Drives and Ansys collaboration empowers digital transformation

Danfoss Drives’ collaboration with Ansys started over a decade ago. As the leading provider of multiphysics simulation software Ansys has the engineering expertise and comprehensive solutions needed to help innovators push boundaries by using the predictive power of simulation.

“What we value with Ansys is their responsiveness in tool development” said Kuivalainen. “Optimisation requires high fidelity modelling and simulation.”

Throughout Danfoss Drives’ digitalisation journey Kuivalainen noticed a barrier to entry for new users of the high-end simulation tools which could be difficult to understand. This caused a bottleneck for product development.

But with Ansys simulation solutions such as Ansys Discovery users can quickly understand how to use the tools; achieve fast high-fidelity results; and explore multiphysics and multiple physics scenarios.

“With Ansys we can democratise the simulation making it more available so that customers get the right support to get started.”

With Ansys Discovery Ansys Mechanical Ansys Fluent Ansys Icepack and Ansys SIwave Danfoss Drives can combine fast accurate physics simulations that are easy to use meaning that this digitalisation is democratised. For example Ansys Discovery features interactive modelling and multiple simulation capabilities which enable users to answer critical design questions early in the design process. This saves time and effort on prototyping as users can explore hundreds of design concepts virtually in the time it would take to build and test just one physical prototype.

Danfoss Drives is also co-innovating with customers with help of simulation and modelling.

“We started to pivot systems in our own application development centres with a customer facing platform. We have physical locations where we can go to innovate and develop solutions with our customers.”

Danfoss Drives provided hardware in the loop solutions which Kuivalainen has found rewarding.

“It has been great to work directly with the customers and look at different optimised systems there. We can see how greatly we can help our customers to speed up productive development and run earlier full-scale virtual testing and performance assessments before they have any physical hardware realised for their product.”

Simulation and digital engineering help to transform business at Danfoss Drives as the company can start work much earlier with its customers looking to develop their next generation of products or systems.

Simulation and modelling systems support software solutions like Ansys Twin Builder which helps the customers to integrate no matter what tools they are using.

“Simulation modelling helps customers to build better solutions.”

Danfoss Drives makes this easy for its customers co-developing tools with customers reaching out and piloting with the customers to understand their needs and being responsive to change. The simulation and modelling products Danfoss Drives offers to its customers is based on the customers’ needs.

For the next year at Danfoss Drives Kuivalainen will continue to be more effective in bringing the message to the market of energy savings and opportunities available through the Drives solutions.

“The journey continues while we look at how we can use the same technologies internally to drive better quality and productivity” said Kuivalainen.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaWdpdGFsZW5naW5lZXJpbmcyNDcuY29tL2FydGljbGUvZ3RjLWZhbGwtMjAyMS1vbW5pdmVyc2UtZW1lcmdlcy1hcy1ob21lLW9mLXRoZS1kaWdpdGFsLXR3aW5zL2Rlc2lnbi1leHBsb3JhdGlvbi1vcHRpbWl6YXRpb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GTC Fall 2021: Omniverse Emerges as Home of the Digital Twins,"In this special digital edition we take a look at emerging product lifecycle management (PLM) and product data...

If talks of GTC this week gives you a sense of déjà vu you're not crazy. This year as the annual in-person GPU Technology Conference switched to virtual format under the lingering threats of COVID-19 it also doubled quite literally. It was split into GTC Spring (held in April) and GTC Fall (this week) occuring twice instead of once.

In the Fall Edition of GTC NVIDIA CEO Jensen (Jen-Hsun) Huang appeared not only as himself but also as a digital twin—a much smaller version of the man constructed in pixels but still donning his trademark leather jacket. The AI-powered Toy Jensen responded to three human experts' questions on the greatest threats of climate change the methods to find exoplanets and the role of proteins in human cells.

This may seem like a gimmick but not quite. It's a demonstration of how AI-powered avatars might give digital twins personalities. The technology behind it is the GPU-accelerated AI SDK called Maxine. “The new Maxine connects computer vision reverse speech AI and the avatar animation and graphics into a real-time conversational robot. Our Metropolis engineers use Maxine to create Tokkio a talking kiosk ... we've been building speech synthesis with my own voice a conversational AI Toy me” explained Jensen in his keynote at GTC Fall.

At GTC 2019 Jensen introduced Omniverse as “an open collaboration tool. It works with all major 3D tools.” But over time his vision expanded. By this April Omniverse was in Beta. This week Jensen revealed Omniverse is open for business. “Omniverse is where we will design train and continuously monitor the factories buildings warehouses and cars of the future” he said.

So how much will it cost to put your digital twins on the Omniverse? NVIDIA announced subscription for Omniverse Enterprise begins at $9000 per year.

#NVIDIAOmniverse Avatar a technology platform to develop interactive #AI avatars that respond to speech and facial cues can understand multiple languages and are able to make smart recommendations was just unveiled at #GTC21. — NVIDIA Omniverse (@nvidiaomniverse) November 9 2021

The Metaverse Landgrab

As home of the digital twins NVIDIA's Omniverse faces stiff competition. About 20 minutes' drive away from NVIDIA's headquarter in Santa Clara engineers are also working on a metaverse conceived by what used to be Facebook but is now called Meta. For its vision Meta has picked a chip maker for a partner—NVIDIA's rival AMD. (”AMD shares close up 10% after company wins Meta partnership announces new chips” November 8 2021.)

Microsoft also hopes to lure digital twins into its own metaverse. At its developer conference Ignite 2021 Sataya Nadella Chairman and CEO of Microsoft said “As the digital world and physical world come together we are creating an entirely new layer which is the metaverse ... It's no longer just looking at the factory floor. You can be on the floor.”

For microprocessor makers like NVIDIA AMD and Intel the metaverses—interconnected virtual universes with immersive visuals—are opportunities to massively increase sales of GPUs and CPUs. For Microsoft they are new sales for cloud services powered by high performance computing servers powered by microprocessors. Going forward we can expect more partnerships among the chip makers cloud providers and metaverse operators all competing and cooperating at times to attract herds of expensive digital twins from large enterprises.

Who's in the Omniverse?

A few digital twins associated with household brands in tech and engineering have already taken up residence in NVIDIA's Omniverse. Even in its Beta phase telecom service provider Ericsson was using it to build digital versions of real cities to analyze and optimize its 5G coverage. Car maker BMW was using it to simulate and improve its factory operations. In this week's GTC keynote the spotlight fell on more users.

“Using the real-time multi-GPU scalable simulation platform Lockheed Martin creates visualizations of the predicted fire movements and studies their flow dynamics across a digital replica of the landscape. This enables its team to utilize NVIDIA Omniverse in multiple areas” wrote NVIDIA blogger Anthony Robbins. Siemens Energy is also using Omniverse to build digital versions of its Heat Recovery Steam Generators to predict corrosions as shown in this video.

Object behaviors in Omniverse are driven by PhysX NVIDIA's physics engine and SDK. It enables simulating rigid body movements robotic systems structural deformation fluid dynamics particles and smoke among others. They won't replace the standard finite element analysis (FEA) solvers used by engineers. Rather Omniverse might incorporate them according to Rev Lebaredian VP of Simulation at NVIDIA.

“Omniverse will connect all these together to create something better than its parts. We want to take all these capabilities combine them to do things that are previously impossible” he said in a press briefing.

Omniverse uses the Pixar-developed Universal Scene Description (USD) language to depict 3D data. CAD developers can enable data exchange between their products and Omniverse via connectors. The assembly importer for Onshape the cloud-hosted CAD program from PTC paves the way for other packages to take a similar approach.

GPU Acceleration Growing

In 2006 NVIDIA unveiled its CUDA architecture setting the groundwork for GPU acceleration of workloads typically performed by the CPU. Adoption of the CUDA programming environment led to speed up in simulation and rendering which in turn encourages more software developers to rework the code to harvest the GPU's processing power.

“I’m thrilled to see Ansys Synopsis Cadence and Dassault accelerate their [solvers for] thermal mechanical 3D electromagnetic RF interference and signal integrity” noted Jensen in his keynote this week. “With multi-GPU solvers from Ansys early results show one NVIDIA DGX server will replace 30 high-end dual-CPU servers” for Ansys Fluent userss he added.

In 1993 when Jensen founded NVIDIA the company was conceived as gaming hardware maker aiming to make the explosions reflections and movements in PC games more realistic. Neary three decades later NVIDIA is edging closer toward scientific computing high performance computing autonomous vehicles and machine learning. The tagline for GTC is “the Number One Online AI Conference.”

Inside Omniverse traces of NVIDIA's origin in games still remain in its uncompromising ray-traced graphics and ultra-realistic visuals. Here the lines between work and play are further blurred and the digital and the physical begin to merge.",,,

Employee turnover is down in many countries along with hiring activity. These factors combined with macroeconomic conditions such as lower inflation and slower hiring activity influence how much and where companies allocate their salary increase budgets.

“We’re seeing mixed salary increase budgets for 2024 compared to what companies paid out in 2023. Actual practice should ensure that well-performing employees are appropriately paid relative to the competitive labor market” says Tim Brown a partner in Aon’s Talent Solutions practice.

More than 2100 organizations participated in second edition of Aon’s 2023 Salary Increase and Turnover Study released in October 2023. The data provides key trends and insights into the state of salary increases and retention across the globe.

Better Informed

Companies are reporting fairly consistent salary increase budgets for 2024 compared to 2023 actual salary increases but there are differences. Companies in Denmark Germany Singapore and the United Arab Emirates are reporting budgets slightly larger than 2023 salary increase payouts. On the other side companies in Columbia Mexico Spain the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (U.S.) are reporting budgets that are slightly lower than 2023 payouts.

“With larger budgets than in years past I’m glad to see more employers directing larger portions of increase budgets toward high performers; they are living a pay-for-performance culture and making the most of their salary increase budgets” says Brown.

We’re told this lawsuit has been filed yesterday in New York so details are limited and we don’t have any comment from any parties at this time.

We understand the lawsuit sees Clear Blue targeting a broker involved in some of the deals where Vesttoo had been involved and LOC’s proved invalid as it looks to recover some of its losses due to the impacts of the fraudulent activity.

Remember many parties in the reinsurance market chain are now out of pocket due to the fraudulent LOC’s sourced by Vesttoo as reinsurance collateral for deals it facilitated some significantly so.

Clear Blue was particularly affected by the LOC fraud but has been able to recover quickly and saw its ratings taken off a negative watch recently seemingly able to come through the experience with its business wholly intact albeit not financially unscathed.

As we also reported recently the lack of bankruptcy estate capital that is expected to be made available to those out of pocket from Vesttoo’s liquidation could mean that creditors would turn elsewhere to recover funds.

Now it seems that process is beginning with a lawsuit filed against one of the brokers that transacted deals where Vesttoo had been involved as a provider of what turned out to be fraudulent reinsurance capital.

We’re told the lawsuit claims Aon introduced Vesttoo to Clear Blue so the fronting specialist appears to feel wronged by that after certain deals it had sat in the middle of went south due to the collateral fraud.

But of course Vesttoo was already very well-known in the industry and making a lot of noise around its product and offering. Clear Blue itself had a significant relationship with Vesttoo and had said in 2022 it would help the insurtech deploy a billion dollars from the capital markets.

It’s also clear now that Vesttoo capacity was seen as particularly cheap in the market so many parties involved in deals were attracted for that reason as well.

So it’s certainly not clear-cut as to who within the reinsurance market chain should take any responsibility outside of the perpetrators themselves for the fraud going by unnoticed for so long and spiralling to such a size that it has affected a whole market in this way.

In fact it seems every participant must take some ownership for the failure of industry checks and balances as well as of collateral security controls.

But with numerous companies now out of pocket and Vesttoo’s bankruptcy unlikely to make anyone whole again we are almost certain to see more lawsuits over the coming weeks and it’s likely some claims might stick.

Aon responded to our request for comment saying “This complaint is meritless. Vesttoo has publicly admitted that its executives conspired with third parties in a highly sophisticated and elaborate fraud. As one of the victims of that fraud Aon is focused on continuing our work to develop a path forward for all affected parties.”

We’ll bring you more as it becomes available as this is likely a developing story.

Shares have lost about 9.3% in that time frame underperforming the S&P 500.

Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release or is APA due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.

APA Q3 Earnings & Sales Top Estimates

APA reported third-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $1.33 per share beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08. The outperformance primarily reflects strong production.



However the bottom line dropped from the year-ago adjusted figure of $1.97 due to significantly lower oil and natural gas prices.



Revenues of $2.3 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2 billion but were down 20.1% from the year-ago quarter’s sales.



As promised the company is using the excess cash to reward shareholders with dividends and buybacks. APA bought back 500000 shares at $41.90 apiece during the third quarter. The company also shelled out $77 million in dividend payment.

Production & Selling Prices

Production of oil and natural gas averaged 412252 BOE/d which comprises 67% liquids. The figure increased 7.9% from the year-ago quarter and was above our expectation of 410387 BOE/d.



U.S. output (accounting for 55% of the total) rose 3.1% year over year to 225639 BOE/d while production from the company’s international operations increased 14.4% to 186613 BOE/d. APA’s oil and natural gas liquids (NGLs) production was 275562 barrels per day (Bbl/d). Natural gas output totaled 820137 thousand cubic feet per day (Mcf/d).



The average realized crude oil price during the third quarter was $86.15 per barrel down 11.9% from the year-ago realization of $97.81. However the number came above our projection of $82.79. Meanwhile the average realized natural gas price fell to $3.12 per thousand cubic feet (Mcf) from $5.62 in the year-ago period but beat our estimates of $2.36.

Costs & Financial Position

APA’s third-quarter lease operating expenses totaled $394 million up 8.2% from $364 million in the year-ago period. However a significant decline in the cost of oil and gas purchased meant that total operating expenses fell 13.2% from the corresponding period of 2022 to $1.5 billion. Our model put the figure at slightly over $1.5 billion.



During the quarter under review APA generated $764 million of cash from operating activities while it incurred $474 million in upstream capital expenditures. The company reported an adjusted operating cash flow of $925 million in the third quarter. It also registered a free cash flow of $307 million during the period though it plunged from $609 million a year ago.



As of Sep 30 APA had approximately $95 million in cash and cash equivalents and $5.6 billion in long-term debt. The debt-to-capitalization ratio of the company was 72.6.

Story continues

Guidance

APA expects adjusted production to average 334000 BOE/d in Q4. Of this oil volumes are likely to be 161000 Bbl/d. Meanwhile the company pegged its upstream capital expenditure for the December quarter at $500 million. APA is committed to returning at least 60% of free cash flow to its shareholders.

How Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?

In the past month investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.

The consensus estimate has shifted 8.43% due to these changes.

VGM Scores

At this time APA has an average Growth Score of C however its Momentum Score is doing a bit better with a B. Charting a somewhat similar path the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side putting it in the top 20% for this investment strategy.

Overall the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy this score is the one you should be interested in.

Outlook

Estimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably APA has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.

Apple's soaring stock price over the past two decades has been driven by its iconic consumer devices. It started with the iPod and iMac. Then came the iPhone and iPad. And more recently the Apple Watch and AirPods. But there's a lot more to the biggest U.S. company by market cap than just gadgets. At its Silicon Valley headquarters in a non-descript room filled with a couple hundred buzzing machines and a handful of engineers in lab coats Apple is designing the custom chips that power its most popular products. Apple first debuted homegrown semiconductors in the iPhone 4 in 2010. As of this year all new Mac computers are powered by Apple's own silicon ending the company's 15-plus years of reliance on Intel. ""One of the most if not the most profound change at Apple certainly in our products over the last 20 years is how we now do so many of those technologies in-house"" said John Ternus who runs hardware engineering at Apple. ""And top of the list of course is our silicon."" That change has also opened Apple up to a new set of risks. Its most advanced silicon is primarily manufactured by one vendor Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. Meanwhile smartphones are recovering from a deep sales slump and competitors like Microsoft are making big leaps in artificial intelligence. In November CNBC visited Apple's campus in Cupertino California the first journalists allowed to film inside one of the company's chip labs. We got a rare chance to talk with the head of Apple silicon Johny Srouji about the company's push into the complex business of custom semiconductor development which is also being pursued by Amazon  Google  Microsoft and Tesla. ""We have thousands of engineers"" Srouji said. ""But if you look at the portfolio of chips we do: very lean actually. Very efficient."" Unlike traditional chipmakers Apple is not making silicon for other companies. ""Because we're not really selling chips outside we focus on the product"" Srouji said. ""That gives us freedom to optimize and the scalable architecture lets us reuse pieces between different products.""

Powering iPhones since 2010

Srouji came to Apple in 2008 to lead a small team of 40 or 50 engineers designing custom chips for the iPhone. A month after he joined Apple bought P.A. Semiconductor a 150-person startup for $278 million. ""They're going to start doing their own chips: that was the immediate takeaway when they bought P.A. Semi"" said Ben Bajarin CEO and principal analyst at Creative Strategies. With its ""inherent design focus"" Bajarin said Apple wants ""to control as much of the stack"" as possible. Two years after the acquisition Apple launched its first custom chip the A4 in the iPhone 4 and original iPad. ""We built what we call the unified memory architecture that is scalable across products"" Srouji said. ""We built an architecture that you start with the iPhone but then we scaled it to the iPad and then to the watch and eventually to the Mac."" Apple's silicon team has grown to thousands of engineers working across labs all over the world including in Israel Germany Austria the U.K. and Japan. Within the U.S. the company has facilities in Silicon Valley San Diego and Austin Texas. The primary type of chip Apple is developing is known as a system on a chip or SoC. That brings together the central processing unit (CPU) graphics processing unit (GPU) and other components Bajarin explained adding that for Apple there's also a neural processing unit (NPU) ""that runs the neural engine."" ""It is the silicon and all of the blocks that go on to that silicon"" Bajarin said. Apple's first SoC was the A series which has advanced from the A4 in 2010 to the A17 Pro announced in September of this year. It's the central processor in iPhones as well as some iPads Apple TVs and the HomePod. Apple's other major SoC is the M series first released in 2020 which now powers all new Macs and more advanced iPads. That product is up to the M3 line. Launched in 2015 the S series is a smaller system in package or SiP for Apple Watch. H and W chips are used in AirPods. U chips allow communication between Apple devices. And the newest chip the R1 is set to ship early next year in Apple's Vision Pro headset. Dedicated to processing input from the device's cameras sensors and microphones Apple says it will stream images to the displays within 12 milliseconds. ""We get to design the chips ahead of time"" Srouji said. He added that his staffers work with Ternus's team ""to exactly and precisely build chips that are going to be targeted for those products and only for those products."" The H2 inside the 2nd generation AirPods Pro for instance enables better noise cancellation. Inside the new Series 9 Apple Watch the S9 allows for unusual capabilities like double tap. In iPhones the A11 Bionic in 2017 had the first Apple Neural Engine a dedicated part of the SoC for performing AI tasks totally on-device. The latest A17 Pro announced in the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max in September enables major leaps in features like computational photography and advanced rendering for gaming. ""It was actually the biggest redesign in GPU architecture and Apple silicon history"" said Kaiann Drance who leads marketing for the iPhone. ""We have hardware accelerated ray tracing for the first time. And we have mesh shading acceleration which allows game developers to create some really stunning visual effects."" That's led to the development of iPhone-native versions from Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed Mirage The Division Resurgence and Capcom's Resident Evil 4. Apple says the A17 Pro is the first 3-nanometer chip to ship at high volume. ""The reason we use 3-nanometer is it gives us the ability to pack more transistors in a given dimension. That is important for the product and much better power efficiency"" Srouji said. ""Even though we're not a chip company we are leading the industry for a reason.""

Replacing Intel in Macs

Apple's leap to 3-nanometer continued with the M3 chips for Mac computers announced in October. Apple says the M3 enables features like 22-hour battery life and similar to the A17 Pro boosted graphics performance. ""It's early days"" said Ternus who's been at Apple for 22 years. ""We have a lot of work to do but I think there's so many Macs now pretty much all Macs are capable of running Triple-A titles which is not what it was like five years ago."" Ternus said that when he started ""the way we tended to make products is we were using technologies from other companies and we were effectively building the product around that."" Despite a focus on beautiful design ""they were constrained by what was available"" he said. In a major shift for the semiconductor industry Apple turned away from using Intel's PC processors in 2020 switching to its own M1 chip inside the MacBook Air and other Macs. ""It was almost like the laws of physics had changed"" Ternus said. ""All of a sudden we could build a MacBook Air that's incredibly thin and light has no fan 18 hours of battery life and outperformed the MacBook Pro that we had just been shipping."" He said the newest MacBook Pro with Apple's most advanced chip the M3 Max ""is 11 times faster than the fastest Intel MacBook Pro we were making. And we were shipping that just two years ago."" Intel processors are based on x86 architecture the traditional choice for PC makers with a lot of software developed for it. Apple bases its processors on rival Arm architecture known for using less power and helping laptop batteries last longer. Apple's M1 in 2020 was a proving point for Arm-based processors in high-end computers with other big names like Qualcomm — and reportedly AMD and Nvidia — also developing Arm-based PC processors. In September Apple extended its deal with Arm through at least 2040. When its first custom chip came out 13 years ago Apple was unusual as a non-chip company trying to make it in the cutthroat cost-prohibitive semiconductor market. Since then Amazon Google Microsoft and Tesla have tried their hand at custom chips. ""Apple was sort of the trailblazer"" said Stacy Rasgon managing director and senior analyst at Bernstein Research. ""They sort of showed that if you do this you can have a stab at differentiating your products.""

'Modems are hard'

Apple isn't yet making every piece of silicon in its devices. Modems for example are one big component the company has yet to conquer on its own. ""The processors have been remarkably good. Where they've struggled is on the modem side is on the radio side in the phones"" Rasgon said. ""Modems are hard."" Apple relies on Qualcomm for its modems although in 2019 the two companies settled a two-year legal battle over intellectual property. Soon after Apple bought the majority of Intel's 5G modem business for $1 billion in a likely move to develop its own cellular modem. That hasn't happened yet and in September Apple signed on with Qualcomm to supply its modems through 2026. ""Qualcomm still makes the best modems in the world"" Bajarin said. ""Until Apple can do as good of a job I have a hard time seeing them fully jump to that."" Apple's Srouji said he couldn't comment on ""future technologies and products"" but said ""we care about cellular and we have teams enabling that."" Apple is also reportedly working on its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip. For now it has a fresh multibillion-dollar deal with Broadcom for wireless components. Apple relies on third parties like Samsung and Micron for memory. ""Our aspiration is the product"" Srouji said when asked if Apple will try to design every part of its chips. ""We want to build the best products on the planet. As a technology team which also includes the chips in this case we want to build the best technology that would enable that vision."" To deliver on that objective Apple will ""buy off the shelf"" if it means the team can focus ""on what really really matters"" Srouji said. Regardless of how much silicon Apple eventually designs it still needs to manufacture its chips externally. That requires massive fabrication plants owned by foundry companies like TSMC. More than 90% of the world's advanced chips are made by TSMC in Taiwan which leaves Apple and the rest of the industry vulnerable to the China threat of invasion. ""There is obviously a lot of tension around like what would plan B be if that happened?"" Bajarin said. ""There isn't another good option. You would hope that Samsung is also competitive and Intel wants to be there. But again we're not right now. It's really all at TSMC."" Apple is at least looking to bring some of that manufacturing to the U.S. It's committed to becoming the largest customer at TSMC's coming fab in Arizona. And on Thursday Apple announced it will be the first and largest customer of the new $2 billion Amkor manufacturing and packaging facility being built in Peoria Arizona. Amkor will package Apple silicon produced at TSMC's Arizona fab. ""We always want to have a diversified supply: Asia Europe and the U.S. which is why I think TSMC building fabs in Arizona is great"" Srouji said.

WANG JING/CHINA DAILY

Apple Inc is deepening cooperation with Chinese suppliers in the area of smart manufacturing a senior executive said as domestic companies sharpen their technological edge and develop advanced automation equipment and solutions.

""Chinese suppliers have grown very fast and become an indispensable and particularly important part of our supply chain over the past 30 years"" Isabel Ge Mahe vice-president and managing director of Apple Greater China told China Daily on the sidelines of the ongoing China International Supply Chain Expo in Beijing.

Currently 151 of Apple's 200 major suppliers including foreign and Chinese ones have a manufacturing presence in China.

""Chinese suppliers are world-leading in their technologies"" she said adding that Apple is happy and willing to help the country transition to intelligent manufacturing.

The trend of localization of intelligent manufacturing equipment has been ""obvious"" in the past decades of cooperation between Apple and Chinese suppliers she added.

There is close collaboration between Apple's engineers and supply chain engineers in smart manufacturing. Apple engineers bring new technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning to the production lines and also some of the latest materials and manufacturing processes to the supply chain helping it move toward intelligent manufacturing Apple said.

Previously intelligent manufacturing equipment in Apple's supply chains came mainly from non-Chinese companies but now such equipment of local origin has become more common she said.

Iris Cui vice-president of Asia procurement and operations at Apple said this transformation of intelligent manufacturing is mainly reflected in three aspects: talent technology and equipment.

In terms of equipment about 75 percent of Apple supply chains' spending on smart manufacturing equipment is used to buy Chinese-developed ones.

Dong Hao vice-president of marketing at Bozhon Precision Industry Technology Co Ltd said that the company has since 2010 become Apple's automation equipment supplier covering a wider range of products from initially standalone devices to fully automated intelligent flexible production equipment.

Dong said the company delivers several thousand types of equipment to Apple each year for more than 180 factories in 13 countries. Through cooperation with Apple's supply chain Bozhon Precision has also promoted its internationalization process.

Zhou Qunfei founder of Chinese glass and touch-screen maker Lens Technology said: ""Smart manufacturing and automation can help us boost efficiency and improve the qualified rate of products. It is a must-choose road for us.""

According to Zhou the company aims to invest more to boost the automation level of its assembly lines from about 70 percent to 90 percent in the future.

Bai Ming a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation said China has advantages in terms of its market technology and talent and its innovation-driven development strategy will help the nation become more important to the growth of global tech giants such as Apple.

(Courtesy: ACS Applied Materials & Interfaces 10.1021/acsami.3c11352)

Going into a public toilet is sometimes not for the faint hearted. Not only could there be visible evidence of previous use but also the unseeable germs that may lurk on surfaces.

Now researchers in Germany and Turkey have come up with a new transparent coating that makes porcelain more water-repellent and toilets cleaner. They used an oil containing the silicone polymer polydimethylsiloxane or PDMS and milled the solution for an hour with small tungsten carbide balls. This process breaks apart some of the polymer’s chemical bonds so it forms a durable oily layer.

After applying the milled oil to one side of a sterilized toilet bowl with the other half left untreated they then poured human urine combined with E.coli and Staphylococcus aureus into the toilet. When swabbing what was left behind on both halves of the bowl they found that the PDMS-treated area stopped 99.99% of the bacterial growth that was seen in the other half. The work could finally put an end to making a visit to the toilet such a shock to the cistern.

The research is described in ACS Applied Material Interfaces.

Sticky ice

While slippery toilet bowls seem like a great idea slippery ice can be a bad thing – unless you like ice skating or operate a ship in the Arctic. Like many properties of water exactly why some ice is more slippery that others is a bit of a mystery. Now researchers at the University of Illinois Chicago have studied the stickiness of ice that contains common substances including salt soap and alcohol.

“Be it dirty sidewalks or the hull of Arctic-going ships there’s always impurities [in ice]” explains team leader Sushant Anand. “So the natural question that comes to mind is: What is the influence of these compounds on how strongly ice sticks to surfaces?”

The experiments revealed that pure ice is much stickier than ice containing impurities under certain circumstances. The stickiness or slipperiness of ice depends on a quasi-liquid layer that occurs on the surface of the solid material – and this layer is notoriously difficult to study. The team did molecular dynamics simulations that suggest that when water freezes impurities are pushed towards the surface where they enhance the quasi-liquid layer.

Arctic mystery

However this discovery led to a another question – if a small amount of salt makes ice less sticky then why does frozen seawater stick to the hulls of ships? The answer according to the team is that ice freezes on hulls slowly. This affects how impurities are distributed within the ice reducing the concentration on the surface – making the ice more sticky.

“Our study represents just the tip of the iceberg opening new lines of investigation of how impure ice adheres with widespread implications across multiple disciplines” Anand says.

The team reports its results in Materials Horizons.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhrcy5oYXJ2YXJkLmVkdS9hZG1pc3Npb25zLWJsb2cveW91dmUtYXBwbGllZC1oa3MtbWFzdGVycy1kZWdyZWUtcHJvZ3JhbS1ub3ctd2hhdNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You've applied to an HKS master's degree program.

Article By : SEMI

The Energy Collaborative aims to understand and clear roadblocks to the installation of low-carbon energy sources in APAC region.

SEMI and the Semiconductor Climate Consortium (SCC) have created the Energy Collaborative (EC) to understand and clear roadblocks to the installation of low-carbon energy sources in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. Aiming to reduce global semiconductor ecosystem carbon emissions the EC is a collective of industry leaders who will provide a consolidated view of priorities for low-carbon energy in the region.

“Sharing resources to start this foundational semiconductor industry sustainability work now is important to enable wider access to low-carbon energy in the next five to ten years” said Young Bae SCC Governing Council member and sponsor for the SCC Scope 2 Working Group and Global Business Director Advanced Cleans Technologies at DuPont. “One of the key action areas the SCC has identified is the lack of low-carbon energy plans and actions in the Asia-Pacific region. The EC will help the SCC by accelerating investments to broaden access.”

The EC sponsoring companies will anchor the collective’s work to engage in roundtables and fact-finding sessions. Initial sponsors include Applied Materials AMD ASE ASML JSR Lam Research Macquarie Group Samsung Electronics TotalEnergies and TSMC.

McKinsey & Company is a Knowledge Partner to the initiative providing fact-based analysis and support.

“The semiconductor value chain and its downstream partners and customers have a pivotal role to play in the acceleration of low-carbon energy installations due to their scale in high-priority markets and the extent to which they will drive growth in future energy demands” stated Ajit Manocha President and CEO of SEMI. “To reach the emissions reductions goals of the sector a step function change in ambition and action is required. The EC is focused on that goal – increasing the pace and scaling of access to low-carbon energy.”

A recent SCC report found that the semiconductor value chain is a significant consumer of energy in almost all key Asian markets. Additionally a recent analysis by McKinsey & Company shows that even with major semiconductor companies’ latest commitments which are more stringent than past measures the industry is not on track to limit emissions to the extent required under the 2015 Paris Agreement. The analysis finds that both individual and collective actions by semiconductor players can help the entire industry increase its sustainability effort and meet the 1.5°C challenge.

During the event he discussed Bengaluru's transformation from a 'retirement paradise' to becoming a prominent tech hub of India.

Chandrasekhar emphasised that Bengaluru's talent pool is globally recognised comparable only to the Silicon Valley in the United States. He went on to predict that in a few years Silicon Valley would be referred to as the 'Bangalore of the West.'

Addressing competition among Indian cities particularly comparing Bengaluru to others Chandrasekhar who is a resident of Bengaluru himself asserted that there is no real competition as Bengaluru is significantly ahead in various aspects.

The IT minister highlighted Bengaluru's rapid expansion and diversification beyond IT noting that the city hosts the engineering and R&D centers of major semiconductor brands such as AMD Applied Materials Lam Research Intel and Fujitsu.

During the Bangalore Tech Summit 2023 session Chandrasekhar stated ""More importantly than just having a back office R&D the engineering of the next generation of devices is happening here.""

He acknowledged the legendary competition between Hyderabad and Bengaluru but emphasised that Bengaluru's talent base is globally renowned.

Despite his pride in Bengaluru's achievements Chandrasekhar admitted to feeling conflicted at times especially when encouraging new brands and companies to establish their offices in the city. He expressed concerns about contributing to the existing traffic problems in Bengaluru.

""As a Bengalurean I have mixed emotions. In the morning when I meet with great brands and companies I say 'go to Bengaluru.' Then in the afternoon I think 'Should I really be telling them to go to Bengaluru because they'll make the traffic problem even worse?'"" remarked Chandrasekhar according to a report published by MoneyControl.

Despite these concerns he expressed immense pride in the city's accomplishments and its welcoming nature towards companies envisioning that Silicon Valley would be named the ""Bangalore of the West"" in the upcoming decade.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMDM5OTE0MDIzMDA1MzI10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A review of the growing trend towards heteroatoms-doped carbon dots based on dopamine acting as a hybrid agent ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0039914023005325 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMDM5OTE0MDIzMDA1MzI10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Self-driving neural networks have become more accurate and reliable due to advances in computing power data availability artificial intelligence (AI) research investment in self-driving car technology government support and public demand. These factors are driving rapid innovation in self-driving neural networks making them more accurate reliable and affordable making them a crucial part of our transportation system. Self-driving cars use various artificial neural networks including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image recognition and classification recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for processing sequential data long short-term memory (LSTM) for learning long-term dependencies deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for safe driving in various conditions multi-sensor fusion for combining data from various sensors and explainable AI (XAI) for understanding and correcting biases in AI systems. These technologies are crucial for autonomous driving enabling safer navigation and interaction with other vehicles and pedestrians. In the last three years alone there have been over 1.7 million patents filed and granted in the automotive industry according to GlobalData’s report on Artificial intelligence in automotive: self-driving neural networks. Buy the report here.

However not all innovations are equal and nor do they follow a constant upward trend. Instead their evolution takes the form of an S-shaped curve that reflects their typical lifecycle from early emergence to accelerating adoption before finally stabilizing and reaching maturity.

Identifying where a particular innovation is on this journey especially those that are in the emerging and accelerating stages is essential for understanding their current level of adoption and the likely future trajectory and impact they will have.

300+ innovations will shape the automotive industry

According to GlobalData’s Technology Foresights which plots the S-curve for the automotive industry using innovation intensity models built on over one million patents there are 300+ innovation areas that will shape the future of the industry.

Within the emerging innovation stage autonomous on-demand logistics end-to-end learning models and adaptive driver alerting are disruptive technologies that are in the early stages of application and should be tracked closely. Vehicular vision adaptive cruise control and predictive acceleration control are some of the accelerating innovation areas where adoption has been steadily increasing.

Innovation S-curve for artificial intelligence in the automotive industry

Self-driving neural networks is a key innovation area in artificial intelligence

Self-driving neural networks refer to the use of neural networks and deep learning algorithms to enable autonomous vehicles or robots to navigate and make decisions without human intervention. These neural networks are trained on large datasets of sensor information such as camera and LiDAR data and learn to recognize and interpret the environment plan optimal routes and control the vehicle or robot's movements.

GlobalData’s analysis also uncovers the companies at the forefront of each innovation area and assesses the potential reach and impact of their patenting activity across different applications and geographies. According to GlobalData there are 20+ companies spanning technology vendors established automotive companies and up-and-coming start-ups engaged in the development and application of self-driving neural networks.

Key players in self-driving neural networks – a disruptive innovation in the automotive industry

‘Application diversity’ measures the number of applications identified for each patent. It broadly splits companies into either ‘niche’ or ‘diversified’ innovators.

‘Geographic reach’ refers to the number of countries each patent is registered in. It reflects the breadth of geographic application intended ranging from ‘global’ to ‘local’.

Aptiv is one of the leading patent filers in self-driving neural networks. The company’s patents cover software hardware and safety systems and indicate significant progress in the field reflecting the growing importance of self-driving car technology and its potential to revolutionize the transportation industry. FiveAI and Baidu are some other key patent filers in this space.

In terms of application diversity LG leads the pack while Aptiv and Ford Motor stood in the second and third positions respectively. By means of geographic reach FiveAI held the top position followed by Apple and Aptiv.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties including but not limited to the issuer.

They will use their connections to network lobby – and even raise investment.

These agri-giants will be rubbing shoulders with over 80000 participants – the highest attendance of any climate conference – which these days comes with increased media fanfare and activity including protests side events drinks and dinners happening in and around the main event.

Oil and gas has dominated discussions at past COPs which have focused on the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions from the energy and transport sectors to tackle dangerous levels of global warming.

This year will be different. The COP28 host United Arab Emirates is using its presidency to firmly press the need for food transformation. On Friday it released the Emirates Food And Farming Declaration which will require countries that sign on to consider food and land use in their climate-reduction targets.

The UN’s FAO is also set to release the first draft of its roadmap to achieving a 1.5 C-aligned global food system. This will be the first time a respected global institution has mapped out a pathway that can help measure the progress of agriculture’s emission-reduction plans.

And that’s why we can expect food and farming companies – responsible for over a third of greenhouse gas emissions – to be busy in Dubai as they try to set the tone of conversations and keep binding targets off the table.

In our interactive Routes to Influence Map below DeSmog has plotted the extent of the opportunities open to the world’s most powerful and polluting food and farming companies and lobby groups to influence debates at COP28.

The clickable diagram maps the major firms who will be attending this year how they are implicated in the climate crisis and pinpoints the spaces they will be moving in.

These many routes to influence – from sponsoring pavilions to promoting unproven solutions in COP28 initiatives – put agribusiness in prime position to stymie regulatory action.

Recent obstruction by agribusiness along these lines includes: securing weak voluntary commitments to delay action and water down targets running pro-meat PR campaigns and promoting unproven greenwashing solutions.

Who decisionmakers decide to listen to will determine whether the UAE summit will deliver on results that safeguard climate and nature.

Will COP28 result in the science-aligned transformation of food systems that civil society is calling for in Dubai that will tackle dietary changes and destructive farming? Or will it lock in an “innovation”-focused industry-led plan to produce more food with a slightly lower footprint?

As this DeSmog analysis shows it’s clear where the power lies.

This interactive maps show the major agri-giants in attendance this year and how they are set to navigate the climate summit. Map design: Clare Carlile.

Routes to Influence 1: Joining a Country Delegation

As food’s environmental impact has come into sharper focus in recent years agriculture’s biggest companies have also started turning out in ever greater numbers at COP summits.

This year industry attendees include major polluters such as the world’s largest meat company JBS along with dairy giants like Nestlé and Danone. Major pesticide and fertiliser producers such as Bayer and Nutrien who attended last year will be back.

Corporations cannot attend in their own right but they can join the delegations of trade associations business confederations or countries. The latter gets you a pink badge and coveted access to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) diplomatic process.

Big companies which have previously accessed COP in this way include JBS which came in with the Brazilian delegation for COP27 in Egypt. Meat lobby group the Canadian Cattle Association attended with Canada in 2022. This year meat industry planning documents seen by DeSmog show the trade group Meat & Livestock Australia hopes to attend as part of its country delegation.

“A pink badge is like a country badge which allows you into the negotiations so you can track what’s going on” explains Corporate Europe Observatory researcher Pascoe Sabido who has extensively tracked the influence of the fossil fuel industry at the annual COP climate summits.

This insider ticket makes companies party to which countries are pushing for strong climate targets and who is saying things that go against their interests. “You can then of course go and talk to them” says Pascoe. “You can also talk to your own negotiators and say ‘look what so and so is doing it’s against our interest’ and get them to move.”

He explains that companies can have real world impact in this way. They can for example use that information to get ministers to threaten to withdraw a trade deal unless another country agrees to adjust its climate stance.

The fossil fuel industry has often been invited to country delegations whose numbers have increased nearly sevenfold since the first COP 1995. In 2021 Canada invited tar sands company Suncor to COP26 in Glasgow and BP’s former chief executive Bernard Looney attended unexpectedly as a guest in Mauritania’s COP27 delegation last year.

Route to Influence 2: Observers to the Talks

Companies trade groups and NGOs that are unable to join a country delegation can travel as part of a trade group that is registered with the UNFCCC. These attendees come to COPs as “observers” to the talks with the hope of influencing discussions from the outside.

Registered observer groups include global lobby groups – such as the pesticide industry’s main trade association CropLife the International Fertilizer Association and the Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef – as well as civil society NGOs.

These groups can’t access the negotiations. But they can still make an impact at COPs by speaking to decision-makers as they come in and out of high-level talks.

European oil giant Shell has publicly credited its trade body the International Emissions Trading Association (IETA) with shaping the final text of the Paris Agreement at COP21 in its favour. The IETA (which features in DeSmog’s Routes to Influence map) also represents multiple agricultural firms.

Major firms linked to industrial agriculture that attended COP last year via this route include Bayer the world’s largest pesticide firm and Cargill a global grain trader and meat company.

“I guess the goal of these trade associations is really to follow everything” says Sabido. “They track all the negotiations make sure that members’ interests are being represented. They also produce position papers and they try to create alternative narratives – in a big way.”

Route to Influence 3: Pavilions

Pavilions are spaces within the conference hall where companies and groups set up booths host displays and hold events to promote their key asks for policymakers and the public. They offer a significant PR opportunity and the chance to hobnob with decision makers.

While the negotiating process at COPs follows a relatively similar pattern each year with talks that span a fortnight the spectacle and activity around them has grown significantly.

These pop-up stations – 225 of them this year – have a captive audience of policymakers diplomats and the world’s media – many of them milling around with time to kill between talks.

For a company or trade group there are three ways to use the pavilion space to their advantage.

The first is to collaborate with a country hosting a pavilion. For example oil major BP found a space to speak at COP26 by taking part in a side event hosted by Russia’s official pavilion. The meat sector plans to replicate this tactic at COP28 by targeting the pavilions of major meat producing countries such as Australia and the US.

The second way is to apply to host a pavilion which can cost upwards of a million dollars. The International Emissions Trading Association – a lobby association comprised of some of the world’s largest fossil fuel producers and greenhouse gas emitters – will host a “business hub” in Dubai which gives a platform to speakers from its member companies. They include pesticide firm Bayer fertiliser company Nutrien and meat packer Cargill.

A third slightly cheaper option is to sponsor pavilions that are hosted by other COP observer groups. For up to $200000 you can promote your brand curate content and create opportunities to shape events and media output.

Pesticide trade association CropLife International meat trade association the North American Meat Institute and dairy trade group the U.S. Dairy Export Council are among those sponsoring the industry-friendly Inter-American Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture (IICA)’s pavilion.

Sabido says the pavilions where CEOs lobbyists and government officials all gather offer a “really good opportunity to lobby”. It can also be “important for coming up with common positions being seen as being on the same side and providing legitimacy” he says.

Route to Influence 4: COP Initiatives

A wide array of “initiatives” are launched and promoted at COPs often at the various country pavilions. These voluntary initiatives can move faster than negotiations and aim to build support and raise new finance for climate-related issues.

Ben Lilliston from the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy expects them to be a key arena for action on food at this year’s COP. “On food I don’t think anything significant is going to come out of the negotiations themselves this year” he says.

As the Routes to Influence map shows these initiatives will be a key focus for agricultural interests at COP28. Sabido warns that these groups will often frame debates in selective ways and contain significant blindspots.

One example is AIM for Climate or Aim4C (listed under “COP28 Initiatives” on the map) which has claimed the agriculture spotlight at the last two summits. The technology-focused “sustainable farming” partnership which is led by the UAE and U.S. claims to have raised $13 billion for climate-friendly investments to date.

The partnership has been criticised for prioritising business interests over climate action and for sidelining smallholder voices. Analysis by DeSmog last year found that of roughly 300 partners just seven percent were based in Africa. Not a single group representing Indigenous communities was listed among Aim4C’s “knowledge partners”.

Aim4C is expected to highlight over 50 “innovation sprints” this year – mostly led by major agribusinesses. Campaigners have previously criticised the sprints for promoting industry friendly techno-fixes that are unproven at scale such as the Greener Cattle Initiative which aims to reduce methane emissions from cattle by changing their diet.

As COP28 host UAE is also looking to leave its mark. As part of its presidency it is rolling out new initiatives such as the Regenerative Landscapes project (see “COP initiatives” on the Routes to Influence map). The project will work to increase the uptake of “regenerative practices” a concept that has been described as too vague and an easy target for greenwash.

Partners of the Regenerative Landscapes initiative include fertiliser giants Yara and OCP. Civil society groups have raised concerns that these influential companies are crowding out research that advocates for more transformational changes to the food system like reducing damaging fossil-fuel based inputs in favour of natural fertilisers and other holistic climate-friendly farming techniques.

A presentation made by the UAE presidency shows that several major agribusiness companies are also mooted for the initiative’s steering committee such as processing firms Pepsico and Unilever and grain traders like Archer Midland Daniels and Louis Dreyfus Company.

Corporations can also bring initiatives of their own. Major dairy producers will be promoting Pathways to Dairy Net Zero (P2DNZ) at COP28 (see Routes to Influence for more on P2DNZ). While industry says the venture aims to address dairy emissions critics say it is actually geared at expanding new dairy markets in the Global South which will ultimately lead to an increase in emissions and pollution.

Doing Business

Companies can use COPs to shape negotiations lobby decision-makers and boost their brands.

But there is another important often overlooked function of COPs: the huge commercial opportunity they represent.

When COPs are described as trade shows this is not just a turn of phrase. Last year at COP27 fossil fuel companies signed five new gas deals with governments the week prior and nine during the summit itself. Sultan al-Jaber this week denied using this summit to pursue oil and gas deals.

Lilliston from campaign group IATP believes that some of the companies attending COP28 such as meat giant JBS will be hoping to attract more funding from governments and investors. “I think some of them are positioning themselves in the marketplace as having climate solutions and being sustainable and they’re raising money from investors around that” he says.

As well as existing government subsidies climate fears are making new pots of money available to the agribusiness industry including from the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act – which offers $19.5 billion over five years for “climate smart” agriculture.

This term which has no widely agreed definition encompasses contested practices such as the ongoing use of pesticides which has led to concerns that the term “climate smart”could be used to “greenwash” polluting forms of agriculture.

Initiatives such as Aim4C and Pathways to Dairy Net Zero will make announcements at COP28. They plan to unlock new sources of funding – both private and public – for business-led voluntary initiatives. Critics say that these industry-shaped initiatives fall far short of the deep cuts to warming gases that are urgently needed and studiously avoid any reference to the radical reductions in meat and dairy consumption in the rich world which are called for by climate science.

Mohamed Adow from Powershift Africa spoke out against what he called “dangerous distractions” at a recent webinar. Speaking from his native Kenya which has just been hit by intense floods after the worst drought in living memory he gave a simple recipe for a positive COP: “We need massive rapid and sustained reductions not false solutions.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nbG9iZW5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9lbi9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2UvMjAyMy8xMi8wMS8yNzg5MjQ2LzAvZW4vQnVsay1Gb29kLUluZ3JlZGllbnRzLU1hcmtldC1TaXplLVNoYXJlLUdyb3d0aC1JbmR1c3RyeS1UcmVuZHMtRm9yZWNhc3QtMjAyOC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bulk Food Ingredients Market Size Share Growth & Industry Trends | Forecast – 2028,"Chicago Dec. 01 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The bulk food ingredients market refers to the industry that involves the production distribution and sale of food ingredients in large quantities.

Market DRIVER : Rise in end-use applications

The demand for products that are rich in nutrients is significantly high in Europe and North America due to the increase in consumer awareness. The consumption of products with an extensive nutritional profile would continue to increase as parents prefer opting for food products such as grains oilseeds and nuts that are estimated to account for a key share in the bulk ingredients market. These products offer nutrition for healthy child development. End-use applications such as bakery & confectionery snacks & spreads ready meals infant formulas and dairy products are projected to witness significant growth in the next five years resulting in increased demand for bulk food ingredients.

Potential Opportunities: Rise in demand for natural or clean label products

According to the survey conducted by Consumer Reports National Research Center in 2013 two-thirds of the US consumers prefer locally grown products whereas more than 60% of the population opt for 'clean' or 'natural' labeled products. As a result of the increase in demand for organic products in the North American and European region as well as the other parts of the world there is a significant growth in demand for bulk food ingredients products.

Clean-label products are organic natural non-GMO and minimally processed consumer-friendly products. According to the Clean Label Alliance it is witnessed that nearly 75% of consumers are willing to pay high prices for clean-label products. The increase in health awareness among consumers is projected to drive the demand for natural and clean-label products which in turn would drive the demand for bulk food ingredients. Consumers are becoming inclined toward clean-label products as they are becoming more aware of the non-synthetic ingredients and their negative effects. This is projected to encourage the adoption of products and diets with clean-label ingredients.

Training and running advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models requires more than just powerful graphics processing units (GPUs). Those GPUs do the heavy lifting but feeding the ultra-powerful chips with data can become a bottleneck. A cluster of servers with tens of thousands of GPUs linked together requires some heavy-duty networking gear to make it all work.

Cisco Systems (CSCO -0.46%) is the longtime leader in the switching and routing markets with its proprietary products maintaining dominant market shares. Across the entire enterprise network infrastructure market the company managed a 41% share in 2022 quadrupling that of its nearest competitor.

Cisco's model of bundling its proprietary hardware and software isn't appealing to everyone. A more flexible approach makes sense for the major cloud providers which build data centers at incredible scale and have very specific networking needs.

Cisco competitor Arista Networks which builds its networking gear using merchant silicon from third parties and layers a fully programmable operating system on top has had great success in winning business from some of the cloud giants.

Going after the AI market

Given that the major cloud providers are scooping up the bulk of powerful GPUs to build out their AI capacity Cisco would be missing out on a huge market without a change in strategy. The company hasn't had much of a presence among the major cloud providers in recent years but its Silicon One family of networking chips is changing the picture.

""We regained our footing there because we listened and we showed flexibility with our willingness to disaggregate if they wanted to do so"" said Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins during the latest earnings call speaking of the major cloud providers. ""So I think that the disaggregation and the flexibility and us listening to them and understanding what they wanted was the reason that we got back in"" Robbins continued.

Cisco's Silicon One chips can power ultra-fast switches and routers allowing cloud providers to build the networking architecture they need in their massive data centers. The chips are fully programmable and support massive data throughput making them ideal for AI networks.

Cisco is having some early success with its AI-focused products and expects significant revenue down the road. The company's Ethernet AI fabric is deployed at three major hyperscale companies and it expects to receive more than $1 billion in orders for AI infrastructure from major cloud providers in fiscal 2025. So far the company has booked about $500 million in orders. By 2027 the market for AI switching is expected to top $10 billion.

Cisco will be going up against Arista which is growing rapidly thanks in part to a heavy dependence on Microsoft and Meta Platforms. Cisco's market share doesn't yield any advantages in winning business from major cloud providers so its products must stand on their own. So far the company appears to be gaining meaningful traction.

Is Cisco stock a buy?

Cisco generates more than $50 billion in revenue annually so AI-related revenue will be a minor contribution for the foreseeable future. Even if demand for Cisco's AI products grows rapidly the company's overall results are still heavily tied to the state of the economy. During times of economic uncertainty Cisco's customers can pull back on tech spending and delay orders.

Cisco stock looks reasonably priced trading for about 12 times the company's guidance for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings. However the company is facing some headwinds as customers work through products delivered as Cisco was bringing its backlog down to normal levels. Cisco expects one or two quarters of lower revenue before growth rebounds to more normal levels.

There's a risk that this slowdown will become more drawn out as customers pull back in an uncertain economic environment which would put pressure on Cisco's profits. Still a reasonable valuation coupled with a long-term opportunity to tap into the AI infrastructure market makes Cisco stock an interesting proposition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9hdmlhdC1hdm53LWNsb3Nlcy1uZWMtZGVhbC0xMzA5MDA4OTIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aviat (AVNW) Closes NEC Deal for Higher Scale of Operations,"Aviat Networks Inc.

Enphase Energy (ENPH) rose 5.4% but is still down 60% this year. SiriusXM Holdings (SIRI) is down 16% year-to-date after rising 4.3% Friday.

Small Caps Jump to 2-Month High as Yields Fall The Russell 2000 an index of U.S. small-cap stocks rose nearly 2.5% to its highest since September on Friday leaving large-cap peers in the dust as Treasury yields fell on hopes of lower interest rates next year. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury declined 10 basis points to about 4.23%—its lowest since mid-September—after two surveys showed U.S. manufacturing activity slowing as demand for goods eases. Yields continued to slide after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed’s policy rate was “well into restrictive territory.” “The full effects of our tightening” he added “have likely not yet been felt.” Treasury yields especially that of the 10-year note affect interest rates across the economy. Small-cap stocks are particularly sensitive to interest rates since they’re more likely to be smaller companies in the early stages of growth. That growth often depends on borrowing which becomes more costly when interest rates rise.

Marvell Shares Tumble as Revenue Forecast Misses Estimates Citing 'Weak Environment' Marvell Technology Inc. (MRVL) shares fell over 5% Friday after the chip maker's revenue declined and its forecast for the fourth quarter came in lower than expected amid a ""weak environment."" While Marvell's year-over-year revenue decline of 8% was slightly better than analysts anticipated its fourth-quarter forecast of $1.42 billion missed estimates. An adjusted per-share loss of 19 cents was an improvement over the second quarter's 24-cent per-share loss and narrowed from the year-ago loss of 63 cents. Marvell Technology CEO Matthew Murphy blamed the recent lackluster performance on the broader market telling Reuters ""You've seen it in announcements from the big enterprise companies and you've also seen it from the carrier companies. It's a very weak environment."" Despite Friday's decline Marvell shares were up over 46% year-to-date. -Vivian Medithi TradingView

Tesla Falls Again After Cybertruck Roll-Out Shares of electric vehicle leader Tesla (TSLA) fell again Friday after falling more than 1.5% yesterday as it delivered its first Cybertrucks an event four years in the making. In an event live-streamed from the company’s Austin TX headquarters yesterday Musk called the unconventional stainless-steel-encased truck Tesla’s “best product” boasting it has “more utility than a truck” and is “faster than a sports car.” To prove it The event included a video of a Cybertruck beating a Porsche 911 in a quarter-mile race while towing a Porsche 911.

The company indicated that a Phase 2b study of the drug danuglipron was effective “demonstrating statistically significant change in body weight.” However Pfizer added that while the most common adverse effects were mild and gastrointestinal half of those in the study chose to stop taking it as compared to 40% who were given a placebo. The company said it would not move ahead with a Phase 3 study. The news sent Pfizer shares to their lowest level since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. -Bill McColl TradingView.

Meanwhile the S&P U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) was 49.4 in November signaling deteriorating business conditions in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing business was hurt by a decline in new orders amid “weak client demand economic uncertainty and customers continuing to run down stock levels.” On the plus side manufacturers reported lower input costs as fuel and material price pressures abated.

Ulta unlike most other retailers expressed confidence about the coming holiday season. “As we look to the future the outlook for the Beauty category is bright” said CEO Dave Kimball in a company press release. Ulta could be benefiting from the lipstick effect an economic theory that holds that spending on small indulgences such as lipstick increases during recessions. While the U.S. is not officially in a recession retailers have noted that consumers are putting off big-ticket purchases amid higher prices shrinking savings and substantial economic uncertainty.

Stocks Making the Biggest Moves Premarket Gains: UiPath Inc. (PATH): Shares of the automation software maker jumped 17% after its quarterly earnings topped Wall Street estimates. The company said revenue grew 24% year-over-year to $326 million while adjusted earnings came in at 12 cents per share.

The Dow ended a three-month losing streak by gaining 8.9% in November. The 30-stock blue-chip index has rallied to a record high for the year.

Similarly the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed out November with gains of 8.9% and 10.7% respectively. These two major indexes have notched their best monthly performance since July 2022. The indexes are now just 1% away from their individual 2023 highs.

All the indexes are poised to cement a year-end rally following a strong November. According to Carson Group’s chief market strategist Ryan Detrick since 1950 the S&P 500 has on average gained another 1.8% monthly following a gain of 8% or more in the prior month.

Additionally stocks saw strong returns in December following solid gains till November. Traditionally if the S&P 500 is up more than 15% till November then the broader index has ended December in the green 75% of the time according to Dow Jones Market Data.

The Nasdaq too finishes December higher 67% of the time if the tech-heavy index is up more than 20% till November. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have soared 18.2% and 35% so far this year a tell-tale sign that the current momentum in the stock market will undoubtedly cement a year-end rally. What’s more stocks have historically scaled northward during the last five trading sessions in December known as the Santa Claus rally.

Now seasonal trends may not necessarily predict the future. But stocks have gained strength in recent times thanks to the likelihood of a pause in interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve amid inflation showing signs of cooling down while the U.S. economy remains buoyant. Per the CME FedWatch Tool 42.7% of the market pundits are expecting the Fed to lower interest rates by 25 basis points in the March policy meeting.

Thus with the Fed poised to curb its aggressive monetary policy coupled with strong seasonal trends the stock market is well-positioned to gain further. This calls for placing bets on sound growth stocks like Copart CPRT Pinterest PINS Arista Networks ANET CrowdStrike CRWD and Lyft LYFT.

Le retour de Johnny Depp

Tous deux avaient en mai dernier gravi main dans la main les marches du Palais des Festivals à l’occasion du 76e Festival de Cannes puisque « Jeanne du Barry » avait été choisi comme film d’ouverture du rendez-vous cinématographique.

Marquant ainsi son retour dans le monde du cinéma l’acteur était revenu sur ses quelques années passées loin de Hollywood assurant ne s’être jamais senti « boycotté » : « Il y a des gens qui veulent croire ce qu’ils veulent croire mais la vérité est la vérité. […] Lors des cinq six dernières années la majorité de ce que vous avez lu est une fiction horrible » avait-il assuré.

Un récit extraordinaire secoue actuellement la sphère financière. Nicolas Puech un senior milliardaire français établi depuis plusieurs décennies en Valais intrigue par sa décision des plus surprenantes. À l’âge vénérable de 80 ans il est propriétaire d’une fortune colossale estimée à 10 milliards de francs. Ce membre de la famille Hermès sans descendance ni conjoint a jeté son dévolu sur un collaborateur loyal et dévoué un Marocain âgé de 51 ans assurant diverses tâches domestiques pour lui depuis de nombreuses années.

Nicolas Puech ce milliardaire trouve en son homme à tout faire bien plus qu’un employé de maison. Il envisage de l’adopter ce qui ferait de lui son unique héritier. Cette relation singulière entre les deux hommes remonte à plusieurs décennies tissée dans les liens de confiance et de respect mutuel. Le geste à première vue inouï soulève toutefois des vagues de controverses au sein de son entourage et des professionnels de la finance qui gèrent ses avoirs.

Publicité

La générosité sans borne de ce magnat envers son fidèle employé n’est pas passée inaperçue. Des actes tels que l’octroi d’une villa estimée à 4 millions de francs à Montreux ainsi qu’une propriété d’une valeur d’environ 15 million de francs à Marrakech témoignent de sa gratitude et de son attachement envers son domestique. Ces largesses révélées par le quotidien 24 heures ont même provoqué le renvoi du gestionnaire de fortune du milliardaire en désaccord avec ces larges donations.

L’annonce récente de la possible adoption de cet employé par le milliardaire a bouleversé les dispositions préétablies quant à la succession de sa fortune. Si cette adoption venait à se concrétiser le Marocain pourrait prétendre à la moitié d’une fortune estimée à 10 milliards de francs faisant de lui un des hommes les plus riches au monde selon le classement Forbes.

Cependant des conflits juridiques se profilent à l’horizon. En effet la Fondation éponyme du richissime octogénaire initialement désignée comme héritière de sa fortune s’oppose fermement à cette annulation du pacte successoral.

Elle invoque le droit pour contester cette réorientation testamentaire. Cette situation promet des batailles légales et un dénouement incertain quant à la répartition finale de cette immense richesse."

The streamer has handed the project a series order.

The news was revealed by Head of Amazon & MGM Studios Jen Salke at the company’s Upfront event in New York who called it an “epic” and “globe-trotting” series.

“If I could tell my teenage self this was happening I think she’d explode. Tomb Raider has been a huge part of my life and I feel incredibly privileged to be bringing it to television with such passionate collaborators. Lara Croft means a lot to me as she does to many and I can’t wait to go on this adventure. Bats ‘n all” said Waller-Bridge.

It’s the latest order for Amazon this morning which gave the Nic Cage-led Spider Man live-action series an order alongside a slew of unscripted series and renewals.

Fleabag creator and star Waller-Bridge is writing the Tomb Raider series but no cast has been set.

Deadline revealed last year that the Tomb Raider series was part of a wider universe at Amazon that would also include films and games.

Dmitri Johnson from dj2 who had secured the rights to the IP is believed to be overseeing the development of the franchise and producing.

Deadline reported last year that Waller-Bridge was teaming on the project with Amazon Studios’ former Head of Comedy Ryan Andolina and Amanda Greenblatt most recently Head Of First-Look and Overall Deals.

Legendary is also involved as rights holders; the company also is behind an anime Tomb Raider series at Netflix.

The series is executive produced by Waller-Bridge and Jenny Robbins through Wells Street Productions Dmitri M.

“Road House” was written by Anthony Bagarozzi and Charles Mondry. Joel Silver produced the film which also stars Daniela Melchior Billy Magnussen Jessica Williams Joaquim de Almeida Conor McGregor and Lukas Gage among others.

Per Amazon MGM Studios its first “Road House” film “has attracted nearly 80 million worldwide viewers to-date. The film premiered on Prime Video March 21 and attracted a record-breaking over 50 million worldwide viewers over its first two weekends becoming Amazon MGM Studios’ “most-watched produced film debut ever on a worldwide basis.”

It should be noted that streaming viewership numbers self-reported by platforms still come with many caveats. Amazon did not reveal what it considers a “view” or how much of “Road House” consumers actually watched before Amazon counted them as part of its audience. The streamer also reported those “debut” figures with data over two weekends instead of one which is the more traditional opening-weekend metric for films. And Amazon’s viewership figure isn’t just limited to that Friday through Sunday period.

On Monday the company backtracked and apologized for billboards that bore the message “You know full well a vow of celibacy is not the answer” juxtaposed against an introduction to “the new Bumble.” The app launched a brand redesign in April in hopes of reviving user interest which had been lagging.

Women on social media castigated the company for suggesting celibacy isn’t a valid personal choice. Some online critics read the slogan as reflecting patriarchal notions that women should be willing to have sex with men even if they don’t want to.

In an apology posted on Instagram Bumble said it is removing ads that it called a mistaken attempt to “lean into a community frustrated by modern dating.” It said the company has long stood up for women and their right to “fully exercise personal choice” but admitted that the ad campaign didn’t live up to those values and apologized “for the harm it caused.”

The company also plans donations to the National Domestic Violence Hotline and other organizations to support global efforts to “support women marginalized communities and those impacted by abuse.” The company said it will also offer the billboard space to these same organizations for ads of their choice.

Bumble did not respond to inquiries seeking information on how many billboards were involved in the campaign and where they were located. It remains unclear whether the ads also ran in other media.

The dating app company has been going through a rough patch. Its shares have fallen steadily since last July dropping roughly 45% over that time amid concerns over its ability to reach younger users. In February it laid off 350 employees roughly 30% of its workforce in February when it announced plans to revamp its app in order to make it more attractive to Generation Z.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vZXVyb3BlL2xpdmUtbmV3cy9ydXNzaWEtdWtyYWluZS13YXItbmV3cy0wNS0xNC0yNC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vZXVyb3BlL2xpdmUtbmV3cy9ydXNzaWEtdWtyYWluZS13YXItbmV3cy0wNS0xNC0yNC9pbmRleC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blinken in Kyiv at crucial point in Ukraine-Russia war: Live updates,"Georgian demonstrators attempt to break into the parliament through a metal barrier erected in front of its main gates during a rally against the controversial ""foreign influence"" bill in Tbilisi Georgia on Tuesday May 14.

Georgia’s parliament has passed a controversial “foreign agents” bill despite widespread domestic opposition and warnings from the European Union that its enactment would imperil the country’s chances of joining the bloc.

The new law will require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “agents of foreign influence” or face crippling fines. Opponents say that the legislation was modeled after similar laws in Russia that the Kremlin has used to increasingly snuff out opposition and civil society.

The event focused on the next iterations in the Architecture Engineering Construction and Operations; Manufacturing; and Media and Entertainment industries.

One of the key themes at AU 2023 was the advancement of AI in Autodesk software. In his Day One keynote addressPresident and CEO Andrew Anagnost highlighted the company’s commitment to delivering innovative solutions by announcing Autodesk AI technology that unlocks creativity helps solve problems and eliminates non-productive work across the industries that design and make the world around us.

Autodesk University this year marked a significant focus on the water industry and solutions. This was evident in the core narrative of the AEC keynote and industry forum highlighting Autodesk’s unique attention to water as a valuable resource.

Advancing AI in AEC and water: unlocking creativity and efficiency

In the AEC Industry Forum Amy Bunszel discussed how AI is being leveraged to support improved workflows informed decisions and better project outcomes for AEC teams. The focus areas for advancing Autodesk AI are analysis augmentation and automation. AI technology can provide immediate insights enhance exploration and experimentation and automate tedious tasks.

Amy Bunszel highlighted the AI and ML additions to our water software.

In the water industry Autodesk showcased the integration of AI in its software including some exciting new product enhancements and industry collaborations. Most notably we announced the availability of the Machine Learning Deluge Tool in InfoDrainage. This tool enables AEC professionals to generate responsive flood maps with nearly instant feedback about flooding hotspots helping to answer questions like: Where should I put the retention pond and what is the ideal footprint to capture the overland flows?

Where before an engineer had to place a pond or swale in the design software and then run a computational simulation to see the outcome the ML Deluge Tool can show the outcome in seconds. This will create an interactive experience where customers can get instant feedback on flood maps in real time and the final design can be exported to Civil 3D.

Exploring a VAPAR + Info360 Asset integration.

Additionally we announced that Autodesk is exploring the integration of VAPAR AI image technology into Info360 Asset for sewer asset inspections automating the identification of problematic issues in pipes. More information will be shared soon on how VAPAR technology and how it can be used to save operators hours of watching tedious sewer line inspection videos while significantly reducing capital expenditure costs.

Read more about the exciting advancements in AI for the AEC industry in Amy Bunszel’s blog post.

Cloud enhancements to water distribution enables potentially life-saving outcomes

In addition to the exciting progress in AI Autodesk has also delivered powerful cloud-enabled workflows to the water industry. Of particular focus at AU was the availability of cloud-based fire flow simulations in InfoWater Pro.

We heard in the AEC Industry Forum how water flow is a particular concern in firefighting. If there’s not enough pressure homes and lives are at stake. With this enhancement InfoWater Pro provides powerful flow simulation for utilities to quickly assess if a hydraulic system will have enough water to put out fires.

Theater Talks: how 3 water professionals are building the future of water

One key area of focus at the AU theater this year was on the future of water management and the crucial role of technology in creating resilient and sustainable infrastructure. The inspiring talk emphasized how water management encompasses more than just delivering fresh water and disposing of wastewater; it also involves watershed management and addressing the challenges posed by rainstorms.

The session brought together industry-leading professionals with global expertise in water systems and programs to share insights on how technology can help us prepare for climate change address water scarcity improve water quality and ensure equitable access to this vital resource.

We first heard from Sheila Thomas-Ambat the public services director at the City of Fayetteville North Carolina who shared the flood resiliency program that is being fully executed based on a $17M watershed plan built using hydraulic models. She spoke about the importance of data and how to properly lean on technology to drive equitable community plans.

Next Vice President at Kimley-Horn and Associates Sarah Williamson took the stage. Sarah shared an inspiring story of the redevelopment of an old Florida phosphate mine into the Streamsong Resort using sustainable water management practices and optimizing economic growth. Her talk showed us that sustainability is not a blocker to achieve economic land development goals. When planned carefully the two can be achieved in parallel.

Andy Smith from Anglian Water highlighting smart innovations.

And finally Andy Smith the Head of Smart Water at Anglian Water discussed his current role driving digital transformation within the water sector with the aim of creating the water utility of the future. Andy demonstrated the power in collaboration whether it’s with a technology partner like Autodesk to help drive the creation of innovative digital solutions or with global organizations that are directly impacting people’s lives. He shared three projects that brought together utilities technology vendors industry organizations and nonprofits to deliver safe drinking water and sanitation services not only to their own communities but to the developing nation of Nepal.

One of these projects was the Wing AI project where Anglian Water is working directly with Autodesk to develop machine learning models to improve operational forecasting of their water treatment facility resulting in £126K so far in energy savings and chemical and carbon reductions.

The session explored groundbreaking solutions and innovative approaches ranging from the use of AI in water treatment operations to sustainable strategies in land development and comprehensive city-wide watershed planning. The audience was encouraged to listen for specific calls to action from each speaker and consider how they could apply the shared achievements in their own work and life.

Mapping our future together at AU

AU was not only a place for customers to learn and network but also presented opportunities to provide interactive feedback and collaborate with the Autodesk team directly.

Several executive-level members from leading organizations in the water industry met in person at AU to establish an Autodesk Water Executive Council. The meeting focused on industry challenges the role of digital transformation and how Autodesk’s solutions address pressing needs. The session included presentations from Dan Lohmeyer Autodesk’s VP of AEC design and solutions and Transcend highlighting their partnership and the value of generative design.

In addition to the ones featured above we encourage you to dig into these water-related sessions any time you like:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9kZXNrLmNvbS9jdXN0b21lci1zdG9yaWVzL29ybXMtYWRhcHRpdmUtcmV1c2Utc3RvcnnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Orms | Adaptive Reuse Architecture,"In the bustling King’s Cross area of London UK architecture firm Orms renovated and reimagined an outdated 1974 office building into a 266-room boutique hotel The Standard London. The existing building located opposite two major railway stations was a former municipal facility built in the architecturally significant Brutalist style.

As lead consultants on the project the Orms team was responsible for the exterior architecture shell and building core. Using an adaptive reuse model the renovation project retained as much of the existing building as possible to preserve its post-war architectural heritage. From there the building was extended and extensively remodeled with a bold design that added three new stories atop the existing structure to host a restaurant bar and roof terrace.

When heritage buildings are repurposed every project is unique—there are no prototypes to follow. Using Autodesk Revit 3D modeling and digital twin technology Orms and MEP and structural consultants Arup and Heyne Tillett Steel created models of the building’s highly complex structures integrated its systems and mapped out solutions for heating cooling ventilation and lighting to optimize sustainability. With these technology tools and adaptive resource processes the project team transformed an obsolete building into a modern style-savvy London flagship for a trendy international hotel group.

[Video Transcript]

Christian Natterodt Associate/Project Architect Orms: The construction industry on its own is responsible for one-third of the waste of this planet. We cannot keep on knocking down buildings and building new ones. There are lots of different projects where we can adapt them save the construction carbon and turn them into something new and beautiful.

The Standard London is one of those amazing destination hotels. The hotel almost puts their arms around you and gives you a big hug a sense of joy also wants to be translated into its architecture itself.

The building is from the 1970s. A building which is dirty a building which is not modernized anymore. It’s normally something a lot of people would like to demolish. So how can we save the embodied carbon which is within that building itself save construction cost and turn that building which is part of the history of the place as well into something very special?

Andrew Middlebrook Lead Structural Engineer Heyne Tillet Steel: Every retrofit is different and interesting as a result of it. There’s never exactly the same approach every time.

Natterodt: We’ve got a concrete core with a concrete facade and two levels of basement. These complex shapes can be drawn in 2D but they can only really fully be understood in 3D.

In the building industry you did not have a prototype. Every building we build is the prototype and the finished product.

[Autodesk] Revit and 3D modeling allows us to understand complex shapes a lot better. Using a digital twin of the building itself we can zoom into every single aspect. We can spin it around coordinate it with the structural engineer with everyone else before we even start onsite.

Middlebrook: We did as much research as we could to find the bones of the building and then using Revit we built a complete 3D model. And that’s allowed us to really retain as much of the existing building as possible.

Within Revit you can assign properties to the materials—the embodied carbon for example—and that allows us to quantify how much carbon is going to be used.

Michael Stankiewicz Senior Mechanical Engineer Arup: When we design building in a refurbishment setting we are instantly constrained. To get to that next level of sustainability we need to understand heating cooling ventilation lighting granular detail and really design how to use energy wherever it’s needed. Having a tool like Revit means that we can map out energy systems designing extremely efficient buildings.

Natterodt: We need to ensure that the buildings we do build now are adaptable. We need to have the documentation in place to ensure that elements can be reused.

Middlebrook: If we need to share collaboratively and quickly and online and do clash detection and build the building together only Revit can do that.

Christian Natterodt: Reuse and retrofit—those will be the architectural tasks of the future. Buildings which have been designed in a different period for different aspects we can bring them back to life to secure their future for the next generation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVjaXRpemVuLmNvLnR6L3RhbnphbmlhL25ld3MvYnVzaW5lc3MvYXV0b2Rlc2stdHJhaW5pbmctY2VudGVyLXRvLXN0YXJ0LW9wZXJhdGlvbnMtaW4tdGFuemFuaWEtYnktamFudWFyeS0yMDI0LTQ0NTA2ODTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Autodesk Training Center to start operations in Tanzania by January 2024,"AD

It is helpful for sharing 3D models and animation details between different software. Moreover it stores data like lighting textures geometry joints and animation and it’s suitable for animation applications and in virtual and augmented realities.

FBX files are mostly used in animation and gaming engines like UE4 and Unity. OBJ files on the other hand store basic 3D model data like geometry faces color and textures but they don't support animation lighting and rigging data like FBX. Most CAD programs support it and it is a file format mostly used in 3D printing like STL files. So if you have one of the best 3D printers  especially the ones that support multi-color 3D printing and you have an FBX file you can convert it to OBJ to 3D print. In addition to 3D printing purposes you can also convert FBX to OBJ if you just want a small file with simple geometries and you want to work with the meshes. This simplicity makes OBJ files smaller than FBX files. Below are the main tools to use to convert FBX files to OBJ.

1. Autodesk FBX Converter

In the following we introduce the neural-network-based vortex detector motivated by U-Net which is designed for image segmentation to solve our private problems41424344. The overall task of image segmentation involves dividing an image into multiple segments or regions where each segment represents a distinct object or area of interest45. Here we are only interested in detecting vortices and the sizes of vortices across the simulated images do not vary significantly hence we focus on predicting the exact position of each vortex core rather than the full vortex region. Therefore our problem reduces to that of binary classification for each pixel denoting the vortices cores by 1 and the other regions by 0. We used 456 images as the data set and manually labeled the vortices cores of them 150 of which were used as the test data to calculate the metrics of the model and the rest as the training data.

In the process of machine learning manual labeling data points consumes a significant amount of human labor and time4647. Additionally for this specific problem the labeling process of denoting the vortices cores by 1 is very prone to errors due to human error. In the process of labeling it is easy to deviate from the exact center position by labeling the neighboring pixels and difficult to check. As shown in Fig. 1 the white circles are the artificially labeled vortices cores’ points some of which we have zoomed in to show clearly. We zoom in red rectangular marked area (b) of (a) and red rectangular marked area (d) of (c). It can be found that the ideal center point is the pixel with the darkest color but is actually labeled as the pixel near to it. This is a very common problem during the labeling process and can affect the training and output of the model especially it makes the metrics unreliable. Meanwhile there will also be some vortex cores missing labeling.

Although the labeled data is not entirely correct we use them directly for model training and propose a new ACL method to solve the problem. The vortex detector model takes as its input gray scale images \(I \in [01]^{W\times H \times C} \)with equal width and height \(W = H = 128\) and a number of channels \(C = 1\) to the U-Net neural network (see Fig. 2). In principle the output of the detector can map a probability to each image pixel corresponding to whether this pixel represents a vortex core or not. The output Y of the neural network is therefore a tensor of dimensions \(128 \times 128 \times 1\) where every number corresponds to the probability of a vortex core being attended by this pixel by applying Softmax function.

Figure 2 The network takes as its input images of dimension \(128 \times 128\) with the condensate density (a) and outputs the probability of a vortex core in every pixel position (b). U-net architecture (example for 8 \(\times \) 8 pixels in the lowest resolution). Each blue box is commensurate with a multi-channel feature map. The number of channels is denoted on top of the box. The x–y-size is offered to the lower left edge of the box. White boxes represent copied feature maps. The arrows denote the different operations. Full size image

Training model by the rough manually labeled data

Firstly we train the model directly on density images obtained from simulations with the GPE i.e. without the addition of any noise. Our training and testing data were acquired by manual labeling which has not always been accurate in itself as denoted in Fig. 1. The architecture of the model and the chosen hyper parameters are given in Fig. 2. The obtained density profiles are normalized such that their pixels lie between [0 1] before being input to the neural network. We use the ADAM optimizer48 and a loss function of binary cross entropy with logits loss49. We have determined that giving a higher weight to learning positive predictions stabilizes training and accelerates convergence50 stabilizes training and accelerates convergence50.

Figure 3ab show the same density image where white circles in (a) correspond to the manual labeling and red dots in (b) to the prediction of the trained model. For the output probability tensor the threshold is set to 0.5 in the experiment where greater than 0.5 is 1 (detected as a vortex core center) and less than 0.5 is 0 (detected as not a vortex core center) as shown in Fig. 3. Overall we achieved an accuracy value of 98.87% and a recall value of 99.57% but only a precision value of 20.01% on the test data as indicated in Table 1. Accuracy precision and recall are calculated for every sample image through comparison between the position predicted by the model and the position labeled by manually which is difficult to avoid making mistakes. According to our analysis the main reason for high precision high recall and low precision is that the vortices cores are distributed sparsely on the density images and even if none of the vortices cores are detected such as all 0 (less than threshold 0.5) the accuracy will also be high as shown in Fig. 3a. More importantly we can find that some results detected by the model are very close to the actual vortices cores centers though some of the labeled data has errors. Moreover the vortices cores with missing labels are automatically detected as shown with the yellow box denoted by the yellow box denoted by 2 in Fig. 3b. According to the results provided for in the model most of the vortices cores were detected but many ambiguous pixels were also detected around the ground truth. The number of detected vortices cores is much greater than the actual number as shown in Fig. 3b which leads to the low precision. In Fig. 3c the white circles indicate that the labeled pixels are among the detected results and the red cross indicates that the labeled pixels are not among the detected results. Figure 3de show the magnification of the red box area denoted by 1 in Fig. 3ab respectively and the numbers in Fig. 3e show the probability of the output result \((>0.5)\). In Fig. 3e we can find that the pixel with the highest probability of the model detected result is just the true vertex core position but the labeled pixel is the pixel near the ground truth which is not detected by the model. Therefore we adjust the position of the labeled pixel to the maximum probability of the detected results and reliable the data set for training and testing.

Figure 3 The locations of the vortex cores within each image are shown as red dots for the model prediction (b) and by white circles for the artificial labeling (a). In (c) the white circle means that the labeled points are among the predicted points and the red cross means that the labeled points is not among the forecast points. (d) is a magnification of the red box 1 marked area in (a) and (e) is a magnification of the red box 1 marked area in (bc). The numbers denoted in figure (e) is the predicted probability values.

Training model by the ACL iteration data

We use a new ACL method to relate the vortices cores position. After setting the threshold value (0.9) to the output of the model by which the probability values less than 0.9 are reduced to 0 as times the mask. Then non-maximum suppression (NMS) method5152 is used to remove neighbouring ambiguous pixels detected. We create a window centered on the pixel position of the maximum probability and suppress all other pixels in the window to 0 so as to iterate this process to all nonzero values in each image sample. In Eq. (3) \(I_{i-1}\) represents the input density image to be detected NN represents the neural network function Mask represents the thresholding operation NMS represents the non-maximum suppression operation B represents the binary classification operation and \(L_i\) represents the labeling data by ACL in which i represents the iteration time. The pseudo processing of ACL is shown in the Fig. 4 in which we threshold all values below than 0.9 and use the NMS window size of \(3 \times 3\). Finally the yellow pixel position is labeled as the new vortex core position.

$$\begin{aligned} {\mathscr {L}}_{i}=B(NMS(NN(I_{i-1}) \times Mask)). \end{aligned}$$ (3)

Figure 4 Schematic diagram of the pseudo processing of ACL in which the threshold is 0.9 and the NMS window size is \(3 \times 3\) as the blue box shown. Full size image

In the actual experiment we choose the size of window of MNS in our data set to be \(5 \times 5\) and thus ensure that the size is chosen sufficiently fine that at most one vortex core is present in any window as shown in Fig. 5. From the experimental results the ACL method can automatically adjust the position of labeled vortex cores position and it’s more accurate than the manual labeling for exact pixels.

The probability output of the model with the threshold of 0.5 has many ambiguous points around the exact vortices cores position as shown in Fig. 5b. The red boxes in Fig. 5 represent the probabilities of points are greater than 0.5 but we want to remove them. So in ACL we set the threshold value to 0.9. Then to do away with the neighbouring ambiguous points the NMS method is also used for the output result. The relabeled vortices cores are denoted by white circles in Fig. 5c.

The performance of the model is measured by four metrics namely Accuracy (\({\mathscr {A}}\)) Precision (\({\mathscr {P}}\)) Recall (\(\mathscr {R}\)) and F1-score (F1). The F1-score is the harmonic mean of the recall and precision and these metrics are defined as follows:

$$\begin{aligned} {\mathscr {A}} =\frac{\textrm{TP}}{\mathrm {TP+FP+}TN+FN}\quad {\mathscr {P}}=\frac{\textrm{TP}}{\mathrm {TP+FP}}\quad {\mathscr {R}}=\frac{\textrm{TP}}{\mathrm {TP+FN}}\quad \textrm{Fl}=\frac{2\times \mathrm {P\times R}}{\mathrm {P+R}} \end{aligned}$$ (4)

where \(\textrm{TP}\) \(\textrm{FP}\) \(\textrm{TN}\) and \(\textrm{FN}\) denote the number of true positives false positives true negatives and false negatives respectively in all of the test samples where each sample has \(128 \times 128\) pixels to calculate. These four values all ranges from 0 to 1 with a higher value denoting more accurate detection. After using the NMS method to the predicted probability outcome the precision and \(\textrm{F1}\) score value are dramatically increased while the recall value is somewhat decreased as shown in Table 1.

Table 1 Detector performance metrics (accuracy precision recall and F1 score) are computed on the test data using manual labeling and ACLs. Full size table

Figure 5 (a) is the input image of the condensate density. (b) is the probability output of the model by threshold over 0.5 in which red boxes indicate ambiguous points. (c) is the labeled data using ACL. Full size image

To improve the performance of the model and make the metrics more accurately represent the model results we use the labeled data by ACL and retrain the model. Then we carry out a second ACL on the labeled data from the first ACL (\(i=2\) in Eq. 3). The relabeled data from the second ACL is then used and the retained model is used to perform a third ACL on the data from the second ACL and so on. The general process is: rough labeling \(\rightarrow \) machine learning \(\rightarrow \) probability region searching \(\rightarrow \) relabeling the data \(\rightarrow \) machine learning again. In Table 1 all the metrics are improved after ACL are iterated four times. The prediction metrics of both F1 score and accuracy by using manual labeling and ACL are gradually improved with the number of iterations as shown in Fig. 6. Figure 6 shows that the first use of ACL improved the metrics dramatically and then improved slowly after each iteration. We also find that the increase of ACL iteration times can improve accuracy slightly and F1 score greatly especially F1 score after NMS which is our detection method in practice as shown by the black dashed line in Fig. 6. NMS is essential for this peculiar vortex core detection problem because the pixels around the ground truth position also detect as high probability values which are hard to judge directly with a threshold value.

Figure 6 Accuracy and F1 score versus manual labeling and iterative ACLs for prediction output by thresholding only and by both thresholding and NMS. Full size image

To compare with the observed problems in Fig. 1 the labeled regions using 4th ACL and the model predictions (using NMS) were observed in magnification as shown in Fig. 7. We randomly selected 2 test samples and the zoomed in the area around the labeled position. From the magnification area of the red box it can be seen that the 4th ACL labeled position and the predicted position all have been located at the ground truths.

Figure 7 4th ACL labeled images and predicted output of the images in which white circles are the labeled position of vortex cores and red circles are the predicted position by the model. Full size image

Figure 8 Structure block diagram of calculation method of label accuracy. Full size image

In order to demonstrate that ACL method can indeed correct false manual labeling we use label accuracy and label error distance to compare before and after ACL with ground truth labels. The calculation flow is shown in Fig. 8. Label accuracy (LA) is the percentage of the altered labels over the ground truth labels which is as defined as follows:

$$\begin{aligned} LA = \frac{1}{N} \sum _{i=1}^{N}\left( \sum _{j=1}^{S} \frac{I_j}{S}\right)  \end{aligned}$$ (5)

where N denotes the number of test samples S denotes the number of vortex core on the ith sample \(I_j\) is 0 if the label point is not matched with the ground truth label point or 1 if the label point is matched with the ground truth label point. Obviously this LA metric can calculate the effectiveness of using the ACL method to adjust the position of the label points.

We also use another metric label error distance (LED) to observe the change of labeling correction with ACL method which is defined as follows:

$$\begin{aligned} LED = \sum _{i=1}^N \frac{ d_1+d_2+ \cdots +d_S}{S} \end{aligned}$$ (6)

where N denotes the number of test samples S denotes the number of vortex core on the ith sample \(d_j\) is the distance between the label point and the ground truth label point in pixels.

It can be obtained from the calculation of Eq. (5) that the metrics of LA is the higher the better indicating that the more labels are matched with the ground truth labels. On the other side label error distance (LED) is the lower the better indicating that the pixel position of labels is closer to the ground truth labels’ pixel position. From Table 2 we can see that the accuracy of the labeling has been greatly improved by the ACL method from 65.89% to 83.44% which is improved greatly. It is worth noting that the second iteration of ACL results in a decrease in LA value although it still higher than before using ACL. And the values of LA barely change as we continue to iterate. The results of this experiment are different from those obtained by the previous iterative ACL method. In addition the value of LA and the value of LED are inversely correlated and we can get the same conclusion from the value of LED in the Table 2.

Table 2 Label accuracy (LA) and label error distance (LED) stands for the effectiveness of the ACL method. Full size table

Furthermore we use the trained model and ground truth label data to calculate the F1 score. From Table 1 the F1 score is only 66.36% by using the manual mislabeled data compared with the F1 score of 83.01% by using the ground truth labels in Table 2. This can prove that even if the manual labeling is not completely correct these data can still be used to train the U-Net and get good detection results which is a feature of the U-Net network that has not yet been proved by the data as far as we know. The F1 score with ground truth labeling has also been improved by the ACL method from 83.01 to 86.36%. But it is decreased with the second iterative ACL and the F1 score increases slightly with the number of iterations but it is still less than when the ACL was first used. This differs from Fig. 6 where the F1 score increases as the number of iterations of ACL increases. This means that with this iterative ACL method labels agree with whatever the U-Net model favors. Therefore in practical application it is meaningful to use this ACL method for the first time not only to adjust the manual mislabeled data but also to get a higher metrics score based on the adjusted labeling data.

In order to establish appropriate uncertainties and demonstrate the generality of the ACL method we artificially created 1000 data samples and experimented with fivefold cross-validation. Each sample is an image of \(128 \times 128\) pixels on which N \((1<N<36)\) partially overlapping two-dimensional Gaussian functions are randomly superimposed. The purpose of the experiment is to accurately detect the vertex positions of all Gaussian functions. First we randomize the positions of vertices in the training data set (800 samples) to simulate human mislabeling data and use the model in Fig. 2 to train the training data set and calculate the evaluation metrics on the test data set (200 samples) which vertex positions are ground truth. Then we run the ACL method using the trained model and re-train a new model to compare the results of evaluation metrics with the pre-trained model. We repeated the experiment five times in the cross-validation and obtained the results as shown in Table 3.

Table 3 The comparison of the evaluation metrics (precision recall and F1 score) between the model trained on the original data of artificial randomized superposition of 2D Gaussian functions and the model trained after ACL adjustment in the fivefold cross-validation. Full size table

From all the above experiments it is concluded that this ACL method can improve the performance of vertex position detection model during training in the case of training data is not very accurate. From the data of Table 3 we can also find a trend that when the evaluation metrics of the original model is better the ACL method is more effective in improving the model’s performance. For example in experiment 3 the F1 score was increased from 82.33 to 99.09% by using ACL.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2hyZXB1YmxpYy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9iZXN0LXByZWRpY3RpdmUtYW5hbHl0aWNzLXRvb2xzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Best Predictive Analytics Tools and Software for 2024,"Managing data has always been a challenge for businesses.

The best predictive analytics software for you depends on various factors such as your organization’s specific needs budget technical capability and the type of data you have. For instance DataRobot is well-suited to teams collaborating on ML projects while Databricks is ideal for large-scale data processing. Tableau and Sisense are suitable for data visualization and reporting while Azure Machine Learning IBM Watson and Alteryx are popular choices for end-to-end predictive analytics solutions.

Before settling for a tool conduct your own research to determine if it is the best option for your enterprise needs. Assess your data and consider the sources and formats of data you have as well as any data governance or privacy requirements that may impact your choice of software.

Review methodology

To write this review we analyzed 25+ predictive analytics tools and selected the best 10 based on five key data points: cost ease of use core features interaction with third-party services and customer service and support.

We collected each product’s information from their websites and signed up for a free plan/trial where possible to gain first-hand experience with the tool’s capabilities. We also evaluated user reviews to learn about current and past users’ experiences with the predictive analytics software. This information was then used to analyze the tool’s strengths and weaknesses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ja2luc2V5LmNvbS9jYXBhYmlsaXRpZXMvb3BlcmF0aW9ucy9vdXItaW5zaWdodHMvZ2V0dGluZy13YXJlaG91c2UtYXV0b21hdGlvbi1yaWdodNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maximize ROI from warehouse robotics,"Supply chain robots are flying off the shelves as warehouse automation gets its due after years on the outskirts of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The overall automation market is growing rapidly: at least some expert sources expect robot shipments to increase by up to 50 percent each year through 2030 with warehouse automation growing by more than 10 percent per year.

That is not surprising since recent disruptions and operational challenges have demonstrated the critical importance of robust supply chains. In the quest for greater resilience companies are now looking for ways to boost the speed reliability flexibility and productivity of their warehouse and distribution operations. Automation has emerged as the answer. It promises to help organizations tackle pressing supply chain problems: addressing labor challenges improving fulfillment quality and safety maximizing space utilization and increasing throughput.

Supply chain leaders can now choose from a wide range of mature capable reliable solutions to match their needs including high-density storage and retrieval systems goods-to-person robots and collaborative robots (or “cobots”)—some humanoid—that can work safely alongside their human colleagues. Automation providers have therefore refined and segmented their technologies to meet different demand scenarios. In the material-movement category for example autonomous mobile robot (AMR) systems are primarily used for piece-pick or more recently full-pallet operations. Shuttle systems are designed to allow higher density and productivity in case and unit picking. Emerging autonomous solutions (such as cobots mounted on AMRs) could help repurpose legacy infrastructure with enhanced technology.

Advances in computer vision machine learning and AI are increasing warehouse robots’ capabilities too with the latest models able to plan their own best routes and picking sequences while navigating autonomously in complex environments. And the robotics market is becoming more dynamic with established warehouse automation players competing alongside a growing number of startups offering specialized solutions or highly flexible general-purpose robotic systems (Exhibit 1).

1

Companies plan to increase their investment in automation significantly over the next five years reaching 25 percent of capital spending on average. In logistics and fulfillment automation is expected to account for more than a third of capital spending the largest fraction of any sector (Exhibit 2).

2

Are they getting their money’s worth? Too often no. A significant portion of automation projects fail largely for three reasons: lack of cohesive vision a poor understanding of automation technology by leadership and misalignment of beliefs and principles within the organization. One consumer goods company invested more than $150 million to consolidate multiple existing warehouses into a single fully automated facility designed to serve both brick-and-mortar stores and online orders. Despite the substantial investment and year-long planning the company found that its forecasts for inventory turns and the balance between online deliveries and shipments to stores were inaccurate. The new facility ended up primarily being used for wholesale fulfillment leaving its advanced automation features for case and part picking underutilized.

Creating a robust comprehensive warehouse automation strategy is challenging. At a high level the available options range from point solutions implemented to address specific issues within existing facilities all the way to complete networks of new fully automated facilities built on greenfield sites. But even within each of those categories there is a wide choice of technologies and vendors. The potential benefits increase as these strategies get bigger and bolder but so do costs implementation timelines payback periods and execution risks.

Avoid the traps

For any warehouse automation initiative—and especially for large complex projects—the decisions companies make during the initial strategy development scoping and planning phases are critical to the eventual outcome. As part of a comprehensive plan for navigating a multi-year automation journey seven best practices can help a business avoid common pitfalls:

Clarify the business needs. Everyone needs to know exactly which problems (such as operating cost service level storage capacity productivity) they want to solve with automation and fully understand the tradeoffs. Establish guiding principles for choosing the right technology. Increased complexity makes selection difficult. To make valid comparisons between options companies need to understand the nuances of technologies within a category evaluate the vendors in a crowded supplier space and understand the full range of potential sourcing and partnership options. Evaluate diverse scenarios but allow for future growth. To ensure that the business case holds up even if underlying assumptions and parameters change significantly over time automation investments can be phased with clear triggers established upfront to keep investments in step with business needs. A more capable costly system with a longer payback period might be the right choice if it gives the option of meeting additional future needs. For instance a larger initial investment might allow the number of bots in an AMR deployment to be easily increased or transferred between sites or for additional space next to an automated storage and retrieval system (ASRS) that would support the installation of extra modules as needed. Think of network solutions not automation islands. Maximum cost and operational impact comes from an end-to-end perspective that seeks to improve efficiency across the entire network with a comprehensive implementation roadmap spanning all sites. Substantial savings and performance improvement can come from replacing single-site solutions with network-wide vendor agreements which can yield better rates and terms. Create an efficient capital deployment strategy to maximize ROI. A playbook of best practices can help companies extract more value including a centralized control tower to keep stakeholders aligned; optimized scoping procurement and contracting; and proactive risk management. Develop and pilot a robust implementation plan. Projects need sufficient time to procure and integrate equipment. Testing must be rigorous and comprehensive covering all SKU types and throughput requirements under a pilot-then-scale approach. A more effective implementation plan then starts with a network rollout sequence that balances the ROI of each step with business continuity risks. Finally a contingency plan minimizes operational disruptions while a continuous-improvement mindset incorporates lessons learned throughout the implementation. Look beyond the technology. Automation needs highly skilled teams to deploy run and maintain advanced systems. For employees who do repetitive tasks automation helps to redesign positions and provide faster ramp-up opportunities. For highly skilled employees automation knowledge can enable further career growth opportunities. Filling skill gaps will require a systematic flexible approach to the recruitment training and retention of employees including from external sources. Companies can also address essential enablers of automation up front including not only reliable data and robust IT infrastructure but also clear (and encouraging) communications as automation changes the day-to-day work of supply chain teams.

Navigating the new normal: Operations insights for 2024

Take the lead

If your organization is looking to invest in warehouse automation three sets of immediate actions will put you on the right track.

Formulate your vision and think big. Articulate your strategy for supply chain automation and lay out a clear roadmap to achieve it. Make sure that the overall plan is based upon robust granular forecasts that consider growth aspirations for total storage and throughput needs as well as operational KPIs such as order profile mix variability handling units and picking types. Use that information to select technologies for the expected operating conditions. But don’t limit your possibilities to your current warehouse footprint: a greenfield approach could allow the business to be reconfigured more efficiently. Educate your board and leadership on the art of the possible. Leading players are developing new business and operating models to support their supply chain automation ambitions. These can include partnerships with emerging vendors to create tailored solutions or integrating use cases with other vendors and shippers to generate synergies through collaboration. For example some leading e-commerce retailers have acquired AMR providers or established strategic partnerships to jointly build fully automated warehouses. Other players have implemented innovative fee structures to increase adoption such as pay-per-pick models in which the automation provider retains ownership of their equipment reducing project capital costs by 60 to 80 percent. As a third possibility some companies are optimizing their end-to-end supply chains with fully automated warehouses and autonomous transportation systems to minimize touches between manufacturing sites and customer delivery points. Secure business-wide alignment on a set of core beliefs and design principles. Establish a cross-functional transformation office to set the ground rules for the project including key stakeholders from functions such as finance operations IT and HR. This team governs the critical design principles that will guide the project and designate the leaders who will be responsible for implementation. Finally set budget timeline and KPI targets to ensure efficient use of resources.

Automation could solve pressing challenges in warehousing and fulfillment while also helping companies meet long-term growth goals. But to maximize ROI leaders must select solutions that can adapt to their company’s unique business needs. Those who successfully navigate this complex path are building a major advantage over competitors who fall behind.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3Rvd2FyZHNkYXRhc2NpZW5jZS5jb20vMy1wb3dlcmZ1bC1weXRob24tbGlicmFyaWVzLXRvLXBhcnRpYWxseS1hdXRvbWF0ZS1lZGEtYW5kLWdldC15b3Utc3RhcnRlZC13aXRoLXlvdXItZGF0YS1wcm9qZWN0LWQ3OTQxZmU2OTgxONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Powerful Python Libraries to (Partially) Automate EDA And Get You Started With Your Data Project,"3 Powerful Python Libraries to (Partially) Automate EDA And Get You Started With Your Data Project

AutoZone data breach class action overview:

Who: AutoZone is facing a class action lawsuit regarding a data breach of the personal information of Plaintiff Salvador Aceves Jr. and others.

Why: AutoZone is accused of not properly protecting the personal information of customers and thus putting them at risk for identity theft.

Where: The AutoZone class action was filed in federal court in California.

AutoZone is facing a class action lawsuit stating that it did not properly protect the personal information of customers when it suffered a data breach this fall.

The AutoZone data breach occurred as early as Aug. 15 but the company did not inform the victims about the breach until Nov. 21 the AutoZone class action says.

“Representative Plaintiff suffered imminent and impending injury arising from the substantially increased risk of fraud identity theft and misuse resulting from his PII in combination with his name being placed in the hands of unauthorized third parties/criminals” the AutoZone class action says.

Plaintiff Salvador Aceves and the class are asking for an injunction to cause AutoZone to implement security measures that match the industry standard so that customers do not incur irreparable harm where there would not be an adequate legal remedy.

It would not cost AutoZone a large amount of money to have reasonable data security measures and the company has a “pre-existing legal obligation” to already have those measures in place.

Lawsuit asks AutoZone to create comprehensive data security measures employee training program

AutoZone is being asked to cease and desist its actions that led to the data breach along with paying actual nominal and consequential damages. The AutoZone class action also asks the court to require the company to fully encrypt personal data from customers.

AutoZone is also being asked in the lawsuit to create data firewalls establish a data security protocol and training for employees test employees knowledge and the strength of security measures and create a threat management program.

Toyota Financial Services confirmed it recently discovered unauthorized activity on some of its systems in Europe and Africa after the Medusa ransomware group claimed to have stolen data.

As promised when we last talked on Tuesday we are back with our Updated Championship Week Bowl Projections. While there were two games Friday night it was the Pac-12 title contest and the last “Pac-12 After Dark” which helped set not only our playoff teams but the selection committee games as well.

As anyone in Hollywood would tell you sequels are generally never as good as the original. For about 30 minutes it looked like the case again as Washington jumped out to a 20-3 lead. However behind Bo Nix Oregon came rallying back to take a 24-20 lead. But as they’ve done all year Michael Penix Dillon Johnson and the Huskies answered every challenge. As a result they punched their ticket to the playoff winning 34-31.

Speaking of Washington going back to the preseason Last Word had them as the three seed in the playoff. After dropping out for a few weeks they returned in Week Seven where they stayed the rest of the year. In fact we were the only site to have them in the playoff consistently. Kalen DeBoer’s squad rewarded our faith in them. Now let’s get to our picks.

College Football Playoff

We’ll start off by saying these are based on all the favorites winning Saturday. If one or more loses then chaos will ensue.

Allstate Sugar Bowl: January 1st- (1)- Georgia vs. (4)- Florida State- The Seminoles may be without quarterback Tate Rodemaker for their battle against Louisville.



Prudential Rose Bowl: January 1st- (2)- Michigan vs. (3)- Washington- The Huskies high powered offense versus the Wolverines stout defense is a must-see game.



College Football National Championship: January 8th- (1)- Georgia vs. (2)- Michigan- Our title game remains the same as the last few weeks.

Heading into our next set of match-ups ups there are pretty much the same for now.

Selection Committee Games

Goodyear Cotton Bowl: December 29th- Missouri vs. Texas- If losses by the top teams happen could the Longhorns sneak in as the fourth team?



Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl: December 30th- Tulane vs. Penn State- The Green Wave faces SMU for the AAC title later today. If Willie Fritz’s team wins then they are the Group Of Five team. Should the Mustangs win then things get interesting. It’s likely Liberty gets the nod after winning the Conference USA crown 49-35 over New Mexico State.

Capital One Orange Bowl: December 30th- Louisville vs. Ohio State– The Cards are pretty much locked into the Orange Bowl. Even if they lose to Florida State they should still be ahead of North Carolina State since they beat them earlier in the year.



VRBO Fiesta Bowl: January 1st- Oregon vs. Alabama- The team that didn’t win the Pac-12 title was slotted to go to Arizona and that’s the Ducks. On paper this should be a whale of a game.



Continuing with our Updated Championship Week Bowl Projections let’s roll through the games by date. One thing to note there are no games on December 24th or 31st to not go up against the NFL schedule.

Games Around the New Year

Cheez-It Citrus Bowl: January 1st- Big 10 vs. SEC- Ole Miss vs. Iowa

ReliaQuest Bowl: January 1st- SEC vs. Big 10- LSU vs. Notre Dame



TransPerfect Music City Bowl: December 30th- SEC vs. Big 10- Auburn vs. Wisconsin- Last week it looked like the Aggies were headed for Nashville. However it now appears the Tigers are going there.



Barstool Sports Arizona Bowl: December 30th- MAC vs. MWC– Fresno State vs. Miami (Ohio)

TaxSlayer Gator Bowl: December 29th- SEC vs. Big 10 or ACC/Notre Dame- North Carolina vs. Tennessee

Tony The Tiger Sun Bowl: December 29th- ACC/Notre Dame vs. Pac-12- Miami (Florida) vs. USC

AutoZone Liberty Bowl: December 29th- Big 12 vs. SEC- SMU* vs. Iowa State- As a result of no SEC team being available we’re sending the Mustangs to Memphis.



Post Christmas Games

Quick Lane Bowl: December 26th- Big 10 vs. MAC- Minnesota vs. Ohio



SERVPRO First Responder Bowl: December 26th- American/ACC/Big 12/ SEC- Duke vs. Kansas State

DirecTV Holiday Bowl: December 27th- ACC vs. Pac-12- Clemson vs. Oregon State- With D.J. Uiaglelei in the transfer portal this match-up doesn’t quite have the same excitement. However we are keeping it for now.



Military Bowl: December 27th- ACC/Notre Dame vs. American- Syracuse vs. Memphis

Duke’s Mayo Bowl: December 27th- ACC/Notre Dame vs. SEC- Kentucky vs. Virginia Tech- Barring some full-scale chaos on Saturday the Wildcats seemed locked into playing in Charlotte. Earlier in the week Duke looked like the likely opponent. However it’s looking more likely that the Hokies will be the ACC representative. This is a rematch of the then Belk Bowl in 2019 the Cats won 37-30.



TaxAct Texas Bowl: December 27th- Big 12 vs. SEC- Kansas vs. Texas A&M



Wasabi Fenway Bowl: December 28th- ACC/Notre Dame vs. American- Boston College vs. South Florida

British design and architecture firm Heatherwick Studio and ODP Architecture & Design will be working on the master plan and timeline for the 10-plus-acre property at 5701 Southwest 72nd Street.

Vadia’s Midtown Opportunities paid $65.5 million Sunset Place in early 2021 a steep discount from its previous $110.2 million sale price in 2015.

The former owners Federal Realty Investment Trust Grass River Property and the Comras Company planned to redevelop the half-a-million square-foot mall into a mixed-use development with apartment buildings and a hotel component but failed to receive enough city support.

Vadia’s firm has yet to disclose specific plans for the property but the redevelopment does include a residential component. Last week the South Miami Commission unanimously approved zoning ordinances that will allow the developer to build up to 33 stories along the portion of the property fronting U.S. 1 from the 12 stories currently allowed.

At the meeting on Nov. 21 South Miami commissioner Josh Liebman said the city wants to preserve its main street at a human scale likely capped at two stories along Sunset Drive.

Midtown Opportunities wants to remove the focus on big box tenants the developer said. Sunset Place’s anchor tenants include AMC Theatres L.A. Fitness and Barnes & Noble. The new project would include smaller retail tenants and restaurants.

Vadia’s father Alberto Vadia was heavily involved in the plans for Sunset Place. He died this week at the age of 76.

Sunset Place currently includes a small condominium component which would likely have to be terminated.

Midtown Opportunities’ new project will mark Heatherwick’s first in the state. The design firm has worked on Google campuses the renovation of Pacific Place in Hong Kong and the Little Island pier park in New York City.

Before Sunset Place opened in 1998 the site was home to the Bakery Center a fortress-like retail complex developed by Martin Marguilies. The property was demolished within a decade of its completion.

New tenants are moving into downtown South Miami including the bakery dbakers Sweet Studio.

South of Sunset Place apartment developer AvalonBay Communities is building a new mixed-use apartment building on the site of the former Winn-Dixie property at 5850 Southwest 73rd Street. The ground floor of that project will be home to a Fresh Market grocery store sources told The Real Deal.

Also nearby Fox’s Plaza home to the Salty Donut Pura Vida and Fox’s Lounge recently traded. Alex Karakhanian’s Lndmrk Development sold the property to Raguas LLC for $10.1 million in a deal brokered by Dwntwn Realty Advisors’ Tony Arellano and Devlin Marinoff.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Might even be the best team in the state overall.

“That’s for you guys to decide” Boyle County coach Justin Haddix said.

The Rebels dominated the Class 4A state championship game with Covington Catholic at Kroger Field in Lexington taking down the Colonels 41-0 for their fourth straight state title.

There wasn’t much Boyle did wrong on Friday night under the bright lights a spot they’re all too familiar with over the past four seasons. They racked up 413 yards while holding CovCath to 64 the first time the Colonels have been shut out since Dec. 11 2020 a 20-0 loss to Bowling Green in the state semifinals.

“There’s no reason to sugarcoat anything they beat us in all three phases of the game tonight” Colonels coach Eddie Eviston said. “We tip our hat to them. Great football team. We ran into a buzzsaw tonight.” The Covington Catholic faithful didn’t have much to cheer for Friday night. Brandon Wheeler | LINK nky contributor

Early momentum was in the Rebels favor converting on a 3rd-and-17 on one drive a 4th-and-2 on another to set up their first two scores.

“Anytime you’re in a game like this you want to start off strong but we just put ourselves behind the 8-ball” Eviston said. “Offense put our defense in bad positions special teams put our defense in bad positions and we just couldn’t stop them. A lot of third down conversions a lot of fourth down conversions.”

Montavin Quisenberry was the common factor in the first half his first scoring run coming from 13 yards out after making a couple tacklers miss for a 6-0 Rebels lead with 2:38 left in the first. After an Avery Bodner run for a touchdown from a yard out in the second Quisenberry made it 20-0 with 5:16 left before halftime on a 39-yard punt return for a score his third punt return for a touchdown this season.

The Colonels had a chance to get something going in the late stages of the half but a drive stalled out near midfield on a sack the Rebels collecting four on the day on Evan Pitzer.

While Boyle was able to pick up third and fourth down conversions throughout the Colonels struggled to do so collecting just six first downs in the contest.

Avery Bodner’s second touchdown run from nine yards out made it 27-0 Sage Dawson also finding paydirt on a nine-yard run to make it 34-0 with 40 seconds left in the third.

Covington Catholic’s Cash Harney returns a kickoff. Brandon Wheeler | LINK nky contributor

The Rebels got the game to a running clock with 6:56 left to play when Dawson hit Geordon Brown for a 32-yard touchdown pass.

They end out on top for the fourth straight season which also happens to be how long Haddix has been with the program.

“Been an emotional week. Some people talk about family and all this but it really is a family. We expect a lot out of them and put too much into this and be our best and be remembered” Haddix said. “Emotional when you think about it trying not to think about losing some of these guys going to enjoy this one tonight.”

The Colonels were making their first state championship appearance since 2019 their 23 seniors closing out their season with a 14-1 record and one game shy of the program’s ninth state title in program history. In the last four years they went 42-10 and this being their deepest playoff run.

“Very exceptional group of seniors very exceptional group of young men” Eviston said. “Every challenge we put in front of them they were tearing it down. Obviously this was the last one just couldn’t get it done. There’s so many things that go into a high school football team and so many things we do a certain way at Covington Catholic. Very pleased with how these guys handled themselves both on and off the field all year long. Just proud to be their coach.”

The loss dropped Covington Catholic to 8-2 all-time in state championship games.

The Goldman Sachs Briefings report summarizing the high priority research at the firm expressed concern over China’s property sector

“The road to recovery for China’s property sector is expected to span multiple years as China still faces the lingering aftermath of one of the largest recorded debt booms explains Goldman Sachs Research’s Kenneth Ho Asia credit strategist … Ho doesn’t expect the leverage to result in a financial crisis as past housing crises have done in other countries. “Policymakers in China [are] very focused on making sure systemic risks don’t emerge” Ho says ... The impact of the downturn is far-reaching. ‘When you have this large segment of the economy contracting — and it’s going to take years to get back to normal — your potential growth takes a big hit’ says Goldman Sachs Research’s Hui Shan chief China economist who estimates China’s potential growth at around 4%. The property downturn will also hit commodity markets. “Before the downturn Chinese copper demand just in the property sector was even more than the entire copper demand from the US” Hui notes”.

HSBC analysts Phani Kanumuri Madhvendra Singh and Davey Jose published a compelling argument for investment in data center stocks particularly Equinix

“The data center market could grow at 15% per annum through 2030 driven by demand for higher storage and computing needs as AI cloud adoption digital transformation and regulations such as data localization provide long-term tailwinds. Within the data center market hyperscalers (typically public cloud companies i.e. cloud services offered over public internet for anyone who can pay such as AWS and Microsoft Azure) are likely to grow at 22% pa through 2030 and could gain more than 20ppts of revenue market share from captive or co-location data centers by 2030 (vs 2022e) with revenue market share reaching >60%. Despite aggressive investment by hyperscalers we estimate that co-location operators will grow revenues at c9% pa due to their extensive presence in key markets and ability to act as partners for multiple cloud companies … initiate on Equinix Inc. (EQIX) at Buy with a USD875 TP: Equinix 1) has a strong balance sheet that provides capital flexibility in the current interest rate environment; 2) is the clear global leader in retail co-location and has built a strong ecosystem of services; 3) returns look attractive while its business model (i.e. retail co-location) is more resilient than others to disruption from public cloud; 4) strong execution is likely to drive >10% DPS growth over the next five years; and 5) valuation is in line with its historical average but looks attractive due to its high DPS growth potential … ""

In a separate BMO report senior economist Robert Kavcic detailed the decline in Canadian household balance sheets

“Canadian real GDP growth has now slowed to 0.5% year-over-year and with the population exploding by 3% over that period real per-capita output is down a recession-like 2.5%. That’s overall economic output per person. But another view looks at real household disposable income per capita and the results aren’t encouraging there either. While incomes got a temporary boost during the pandemic and much of that is still on the balance sheet per-capita disposable income after inflation continues to fall. In level terms it’s now about back in-line with the pre-COVID bonanza. So temporary boost aside this measure has slowed to just a 0.3% annualized crawl over the past decade and the only weaker period was the mean days of the mid-1990s. Aside from a pop in Q1 real household consumption has now crawled at less than 0.7% annualized in four of the past five quarters—and that’s not population adjusted”

Meta sued the FTC on Thursday asking for an immediate halt on the commission’s efforts to modify their 2020 privacy settlement. The social media behemoth claims that the agency’s in-house process to deliberate on the matter violates the US Constitution.

At the center of Meta’s complaint is the allegation that the FTC’s administrative process is biased in favor of its commissioners in a way that an independent court’s proceedings wouldn’t be.

“This is a serious attack by serious lawyers on the way the FTC does business” said David Vladeck a law professor at Georgetown University who headed the agency’s Consumer Protection Bureau during the Obama administration.

The lawsuit filed in the US District Court for the District of Columbia followed Monday’s dismissal in the same court of Meta’s complaint that sought to require judicial approval for the FTC to reopen the $5 billion agreement—the largest privacy enforcement payment in US history.

Judge Timothy Kelly denied Meta’s motion but declined to weigh in on any constitutional arguments writing that “what has to happen is Meta has to go and file another lawsuit.” Meta immediately said it would appeal and filed an emergency motion Wednesday at the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to block the FTC’s move.

Meta’s new lawsuit follows other corporations’ efforts to persuade the federal courts that the FTC’s administrative adjudication process is constitutionally defective. The US Supreme Court opened the door to such arguments with its unanimous combined ruling in Axon Enterprise v. FTC and SEC v. Cochran in April which allows enforcement targets of the FTC and the Securities and Exchange Commission to challenge the constitutionality of their actions without waiting for an in-house administrative law judge’s decision.

Before the Axon decision Meta couldn’t have challenged the constitutionality of the FTC’s move to revise its order which the company hasn’t yet responded to through the agency’s administrative process.

Meta’s “argument is going to be that structurally it does not conform with standards of due process—that is to have the same people who decide to prosecute ultimately decide whether there is a violation” said William Kovacic former FTC chairman and current George Washington University law professor.

High Court Parallel

The FTC is far from the only federal agency to find itself on the defensive as court challenges increasingly target administrative authority noted Jill Fisch a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s law school.

The newly filed case follows arguments this week at the Supreme Court in SEC v. Jarkesy over that agency’s ability to seek penalties before in-house judges. Meta’s complaint raises the same questions including whether Congress can delegate the power to assign disputes for administrative adjudication to an agency—and whether the proceedings violate the enforcement target’s right to a trial by jury.

The high court is expected to rule on the case next summer.

“To the extent that the Supreme Court decides those issues that’s going to affect Meta” said Fisch.

To be sure there are differences in the cases. A key distinction is that FTC claims are not self-enforcing like the SEC’s—a court must approve financial penalties Vladeck noted. Moreover Meta’s complaint speaks specifically to administrative actions decided by the agency’s commissioners rather than by administrative law judges.

Meta’s complaint Fisch said fits into a broader trend set at the Supreme Court level to scrutinize agency power. That’s a question raised not just in Jarkesy and Axon cases she said but also in two others: the high court’s 2022 ruling in West Virginia v. EPA which diminished agency power to interpret laws and 2020’s Seila Law LLC v. CFPB which held that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s structure was unconstitutional.

Health-care company Illumina also challenged the constitutionality of the FTC’s enforcement setup this year in a case before the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.

The cases are “all about scrutinizing the way administrative agencies have functioned since the 1930s” said Fisch. “So there may be arguments that yes this is the way that things have been done but the world has changed and the powers that they are exercising are different—and that that might be a justification for a closer look at what they’re doing.”

The new FTC case bears other similarities to challenges to the CFPB Vladeck said. In 2020 the Supreme Court balked at the restrictions on a president’s ability to fire the financial protection agency’s director written into the bureau’s establishing statute. Meta’s complaint points to a similar structure in place at the FTC.

A court ruling that the FTC’s enforcement action is unconstitutional could set in motion appeals that would bring the issue before a Supreme Court that seems receptive to a reassessment of the legitimacy of the structure and procedure of the commission and other regulatory agencies Kovacic said.

“I think what the Supreme Court or at least some justices on the Supreme Court have signaled is a willingness to cut back on the scope of administrative agency power” said Fisch.

Signals from the high court haven’t all been aligned with plaintiffs against agencies however. In October the court signaled it would likely back the CFPB in a challenge to the constitutionality of its funding structure set under the Federal Reserve.

Privacy Fallout

The case will also slow down the FTC’s action against Meta both Vladeck and Kovacic said.

The FTC proposed updates to the agreement in May that would limit how the company uses facial recognition and ban it from profiting off the data of children potentially leading to major changes in Meta’s business model.

“I just don’t see how the FTC is going to be able to move ahead until this case is resolved one way or another” said Vladeck.

A ruling going against the FTC could jeopardize its ability to protect consumers and their privacy said John Davisson senior counsel and director of litigation at the Electronic Privacy Information Center.

“They are basically saying decades of congressional enactment authorizing the FTC to do enforcement work and decades of FTC practice in which they’ve done that work has secretly the whole time been unconstitutional” said Davisson.

Privacy advocates and members of Congress critical of Meta’s handling of children’s data and online safety blasted the lawsuit and raced to the agency’s defense.

“Meta’s baseless lawsuit is a weak attempt to avoid accountability for its repeated failures to protect kids’ privacy online” Sen. Edward Markey (D-Mass.) author of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act the federal law that Meta is accused of violating said in a press release. “When a Big Tech company wants to take the federal cop off the beat it’s probably because it doesn’t want to be caught.”

Facebook didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Markey’s statement.

The case is Meta Platforms Inc. v. The Federal Trade Commission D.D.C. No. 1:23-cv-03562 complaint filed 11/30/23.",,,,,,,,,

Active rigs in the US increased by three this week to 625 vs. the prior week. Oil rigs increased by five to 505. Gas rigs fell by one to 116 and miscellaneous rigs dropped by one to four.

Compared to the same period last year the US count is down by 159 with 122 fewer oil rigs 39 fewer gas rigs but two additional miscellaneous rigs.

Canadian rig count

The Canadian weekly rig count dropped by five to 192 active rigs. Oil rigs declined by two to 122 and gas rigs fell by three to 70.

There are three fewer active rigs in Canada than there were during the same week in 2022. Oil rigs are down by six and gas rigs are up by three.

International rig count

The international rig count is updated monthly. The total number of active rigs during the month of November was 978 up 16 from the previous month and increasing by 68 from November 2022.

The Baker Hughes rig count is important to the steel industry as it is a leading indicator of demand for oil country tubular goods (OCTG) a key end market for steel sheet.

A rotary rig rotates the drill pipe from the surface to either drill a new well or sidetrack an existing one. Wells are drilled to explore for develop and produce oil or natural gas. Baker Hughes’ rotary rig count includes only those rigs that are significant consumers of oilfield services and supplies.

What is the trilemma facing the energy industry?

As businesses organisations and governments all over the world put more and more effort into decarbonising the economy the energy industry faces a trilemma which can be broken down into three main pillars. Firstly it needs secure affordable and scalable energy to serve a growing population. Secondly that energy must be delivered converted and consumed more efficiently. And thirdly there is a need for new cleaner energy sources to support growth whilst replacing the widespread use of fossil fuels.

Do you think the current conversation around decarbonisation takes into account all three pillars of the trilemma?

The conversation surrounding decarbonisation can often be too narrow which risks neglecting the wider trilemma. Conversations can be dominated around potential solutions like ‘banning all fossil fuels’ which doesn’t take into account how complicated of an issue this is. If we are to succeed in providing robust reliable and affordable energy to everyone on the planet each pillar of the trilemma needs to be addressed.

For example if we look at the first issue there is the need to significantly increase the number of people who have access to electricity. Although an additional one billion people have been given access to electricity in the past few decades there are still around one billion people worldwide who do not have access to electricity. Additionally there is the issue of efficiency – currently around 65% of the energy that is sourced converted and consumed worldwide is wasted through inefficiencies.

So before we even look at the third pillar of the trilemma – developing a new cleaner energy source – there are significant things that can be done to improve the situation in the short term and increase the energy we currently supply through a big improvement in efficiency.

In this endeavour digital engineering is making great strides forward. The application of digital technologies to engineering design simulation optimisation and the operation of systems and processes across the whole life cycle of a product is making a significant contribution to energy efficiency and sustainability – and its contribution will only increase over time.

What can be done in the short term if we are to achieve our net-zero goals?

In the short term whilst we are in a transitional period where new technologies and energy sources are being discovered and developed improving energy efficiency in all products and processes is the best way to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. If efforts are focused on this area it could reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by up to 40% which would go a long way to helping us achieve our short-term net-zero ambitions. Currently 31% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions footprint comes from converting fossil fuels into electricity and heat; of that electricity a massive 45% is used in electrical motors in isolation. This means that currently 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions produced by humans come from electric motors. This is particularly significant as the global transportation sector is currently embarking on a vast electrification effort meaning that the use of electric motors is set to exponentially increase in the coming decades. As a result any efficiency that can be improved in electric motors could reduce global emissions by a few percent. Although that may sound small this would be a huge win for the planet as this solution is made up of many smaller percentage reductions in the aggregate.

How can digital engineering be employed in the design process to improve sustainability?

It is crucial to consider sustainability right from the off in the design process. This is because the majority of a product’s cost and environmental impact are locked in during the development and design cycle. One such decision that is critical to the overall impact that any product may have is that of materials selection. The materials that are used determine weight and therefore overall efficiency but also the recyclability. This is where the extensive use of digital engineering is pivotal. Firms are able to use digital engineering to input the exact properties of countless materials to be used in their simulations that are done at the beginning of the lifecycle. This means they get full insight into the most energy-efficient and cost-effective materials to use. Once the materials are chosen further simulations can be done to determine the optimal shape and makeup of a product again reducing material usage but critically without reducing strength. All of this works together to make a product that is more efficient in the first instance but also goes a long way to improving the overall life cycle of the product including having less material to recycle at the end of the lifecycle thus reducing energy consumption even further.

How can digital engineering be employed as the energy industry transitions to a more digital future?

On our path to a more sustainable future there are many new technologies that will be employed. The evolution of technologies such as the Internet of Things and 5G communications are driving the digital transformation of the industry as a whole and will play a crucial role moving forward. However the challenge comes with regards to energy assets and infrastructure that were commissioned long ago well before the explosion of the digital age. A big component of shifting the entire industry forward will be installing sensors actuators and communication devices so they can all be incorporated into the Internet of Things and this again is where the extensive use of digital engineering will be critical. It will allow a digital thread to be created that links all assets old and new into a single system that can be monitored by digital twins. Digital twins are a virtual replica of a real-world asset that allows engineers to understand how that asset will work in any given scenario. The use of digital twins allows teams to optimise efficiency reliability durability and real-time performance – all absolutely crucial to ensuring the long-term sustainability of any given product.

The pilot will allow the company to scale circular packaging in about 18 markets over the next three years an approach that jumps on the success of similar efforts in the company’s Indonesia ecoSPIRITS program which launched in 2022 and is active in 38 bars.

Using a 4.5 liter eco tote which functions like a keg Diageo will be able to introduce a closed loop circular economy strategy to its distribution. Once totes are empty they are collected and transported to offsite facilities to be cleaned and refilled with the same spirit before being reintroduced into the distribution cycle.

The partnership with ecoSPIRITS allows the company to continue distributing in kegs — which it has done so with its Guinness brand since 1749 — while reaping the benefits of tech-powered packaging sustainability.

These benefits include reducing carbon emissions and waste as the totes can be reused up to 150 times and are expected to eliminate the use of up to 1000 glass bottles over that lifespan. This approach is part of Diageo’s larger efforts to reduce 50% of carbon emissions across its supply chain by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050.

Ewan Andrew president of global supply chain and procurement and chief sustainability officer at Diageo said the efforts are a “triple win” benefitting the planet consumers and Diageo by reducing both carbon and cost and introducing the ease of reusable spirits packaging to pubs and bars.

The company also introduced efficiencies into its supply chain and across its enterprise by overhauling its IT environment with cloud migration earlier this year. Through this effort Diageo is introducing enterprise-wide agility and more intuitive decision-making capabilities with real-time tracking.

As an added bonus John Waite will accompany us on the journey adding his No. 1 hits to a special night of classic rock.""

""Looking forward to blazing across the USA with my band this summer. All the hits in all the cities. It will be major. A great night. Don’t miss it - be there!"" said John Waite.

The couple were joined by Olivia Rodrigo Paris Hilton and Dixie D'Amelio along with a number of fashionable guests at this year's KIIS FM's iHeartRadio Jingle Ball.

Rodrigo was seen in a tight dark silver mini dress with a low-cut neckline while Hilton - who recently welcomed her second child via surrogate - had all eyes on her in a theatrical shimmering silver dress with a number of star accents along the hem.

Rodrigo was one of the artists who performed at this year's KIIS-FM Jingle Ball which is an annual concert produced by the Los Angeles radio station KIIS-FM.

Other stars performing included Niall Horan AJR Sabrina Carpenter Miguel Doechii Flo Rida (G)I-DLE and P1Harmony.

Robach and Holmes' attendance at the event signals their love is still going strong a little over a year after it was revealed they were an item.

On November 10 2022 the two were spotted at O'Donoghue's bar in Times Square hours after pre-recording their daily segment.

'They were totally into each other' an eyewitness told DailyMail.com.

'She was giggling at whatever he was saying and they were looking at each other's phones. At one point she was kind of dancing in her chair to the music and laughing so hard she practically fell into his lap.'

The following day Holmes was seen leaving his apartment with a backpack and a duffle and after a morning filming heading to a West Village restaurant near Robach's apartment.

Moments later he walked around the corner and headed up the block to where Robach was waiting to pick him up in her BMW convertible.

The pair drove north of the city for a two-hour drive to Shawangunk Mountains where they checked into a cottage nestled in the wilderness.

They checked out on November 13 and Holmes was seen grabbing Robach's rear as she bent to pack up the car.

On November 17 the pair met again after the day's filming ended. Holmes met Robach a Stage 2 breast cancer survivor at NYU Langone Medical Center. Later Robach's friend walked her dog while she and Holmes stayed in her apartment.

Holmes and Robach spent a weekend shacked up in a cozy cottage in the Shawangunk Mountain region checking out of their rental on Sunday November 13. Holmes was seen giving his lover a playful squeeze from behind as she packed up the car

The duo were removed from the air less than a month after the photos dropped though viewers were told the change would be 'temporary.'

In January an email memo was sent to staff notifying them of the pair's departure.

'I want to share with you that we've reached a decision about T.J. and Amy' it read.

'After several productive conversations with Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes about different options we all agreed it's best for everyone that they move on from ABC News.

'We recognize their talent and commitment over the years and are thankful for their contributions.'

Robach's ex-husband Andrew Shue wiped all traces of her from social media just days after news of the infidelity broke.

The couple wedded in 2008 following Robach's split from Tim McIntosh and had a blended family including five children from previous marriages.

Likewise Holmes and his ex-wife Marilee Fiebig divorced in December 2022 after reportedly separating that August.

The pair welcomed a baby girl in 2013 and were married for 12 years. Holmes has two other children a son and a daughter from his previous marriage with Amy Ferson.

Later that afternoon the couple were caught in a rare PDA moment as they held hands in the back of an Uber while heading to Robach's apartment

But being removed from the show they first met at did not seem to slow down their love as they were seen running the NYC marathon together last month.

The former stars were among the nearly 50000 runners who flocked to the streets of New York to partake in the tradition.

The race started in Staten Island and sent competitors through the four remaining boroughs before ending in Central Park near the West 60s.

Robach 50 wore a green tank top and black Nike leggings and sported a grin as she jogged down Clinton Avenue in Brooklyn.

She ran alongside Holmes 46 who wore an all-black ensemble complete with athletic tights.

The duo were seen jogging side-by-side in Brooklyn. They were among a slew of TV stars in attendance including another broadcast journalist - Sheinelle Jones of the Today Show

Their appearance came four days after an Instagram announcement for their upcoming podcast Amy and T.J.

The iHeartRadio podcast is set to drop on December 5 exactly one year after the journalists were fired from Good Morning America

The pair were seen participating in the annual NYC marathon days after they announced the launch of their new podcast on Instagram aptly titled Amy and T.J.

It is set to debut on the first anniversary of their removal from the daytime television program December 5.

'How's this for Instagram official? #silentnomore' the couple wrote in separate posts on their respective Instagram accounts.

""Amy & T.J."" December 5th. Listen on the iHeartRadio app and everywhere podcasts are heard. @amyandtjpodcast.'

Accompanying the caption was a photo of the couple baring huge smiles with Holmes embracing Robach from behind.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3JvYmxveC1hbmltZS1iYWxsLWNvZGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Roblox: Anime Ball Codes (January 2024),"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL3JvYmxveC1hbmltZS1iYWxsLWNvZGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9kZW52ZXIvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzEyLzAxL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1wcm9qZWN0cy10by13YXRjaC1jb3Zlci5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who's Who in Aerospace: Colorado companies and people to watch in 2024 - Denver Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2023/12/01/aerospace-projects-to-watch-cover.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9kZW52ZXIvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzEyLzAxL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1wcm9qZWN0cy10by13YXRjaC1jb3Zlci5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Video Transcript

JOSH LIPTON: Some of the top trades of this year involve the Magnificent Seven. And Bank of America says they could be the top names to watch next year too but not in the way you might think. Madison Mills is here with the details.

MADISON MILLS: Well it's exactly what you were sort of just talking about with these high valuations right some of these big names like a Hartnett from B of A are talking about looking outside of the Magnificent Seven but to some names that are tech adjacent right? So he specifically talks about going long on distressed tech. If you look at the S&P biotech ETF for example ticker XBI he says that this example here tends to move opposite to rates so that could be attractive as we are anticipating those rate cuts moving forward.

We're also seeing low valuations in some of those biotech names which obviously is in very stark contrast to the valuations we're seeing in those top seven names that we talk about all the time. But I do want to contextualize this call from Hartnett because those seven S&P 500 top names they're gaining 71% this year. The other 493 stocks adding only 6% to the overall index. So I guess if you want to make an argument for more of a bull market next year you kind of have to believe that some of these other tech names are going to grow.

JULIE HYMAN: OK. So you mentioned biotech is there anything else that he sort of Zooms in on as potentially being winners here?

MADISON MILLS: He talks about investment-grade bonds for some of these tech Companies he says it's a way for you to own the balance sheet of those companies rather than just owning the stock itself. And also talks about it as a potential hedge against any sort of hard landing. It's a different way to get in on the tech play.

He also talks about a blend of bond investment. He's bullish on 30-year Treasury bonds mixed with investment-grade bonds. So I thought that was interesting. It also raised this question to me of whether this stock-bond portfolio relationship that we always talk about is starting to shift a little bit with the 60/40 portfolio.

Story continues

JULIE HYMAN: It's also interesting because in the past when we would have this like corporate bond conversation there were very few ways for retail investors short of calling a broker to get in on it. But now there are ETFs that sort of wrap some of that corporate debt that are you know and some of them are actively managed. So it's kind of an interesting time on that front.

JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. Anything to the note Maddie that you saw that really surprised you?

MADISON MILLS: You know I thought it was interesting that they were brave enough to talk about the Magnificent Seven as a play that's not going to continue moving forward particularly given that Savita Subramanian still sees the S&P 500 target from B of A hitting 5000 next year. I'm curious about how they square those two arguments how are we going to see the S&P have that much growth if it's going to be outside of these big seven names. Is it going to be distressed tech like he's saying here going long on distressed tech? I don't know. I don't know that we've seen great evidence of that. But I'm also not you know working at these banks. I just get to talk about it. So I have an easier job here.

JULIE HYMAN: Brave or we'll see if it still looks brave at the end of the year. Maddie thanks so much. Appreciate it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpbmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9lbmdsaXNoLW5ld3MvNjAzOTMtYmFuay1vZi1hbWVyaWNhLXN3aXR6ZXJsYW5kLWdyb3d0aNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank of America Wants to Ramp Up Swiss Business,"Bank of America (BofA) clients in Switzerland include various global multinationals such as food company Nestlé and cigarette manufacturer Philip Morris International. But it doesn’t want to restrict itself to these. The bank has growth plans and believes conditions are right for economic activity to recover again.

«We’re here to stay and we want to be a top player in Switzerland» country executive for Switzerland Thorsten Pauli commented at an event with media representatives in Zurich. He took over the management of the Swiss subsidiary several months ago from Manuel Ebner – nephew of financier Martin Ebner – who had stepped down after around 13 years.

Team Expanding

The Swiss teams in corporate banking under Brooke Wachtel and for mergers and acquisitions (M&A) under Head of Investment Banking Vincent Thiebaud are set to grow. Pauli noted that the number of employees in Switzerland has risen in the past 20 months. «Of course we want to further expand the customer base in Switzerland» Pauli said. «We bring international qualities to the table and can offer a one-stop shop for all services.»

According to Pauli the prospects for a revival of business are good despite uncertainties. The bank is expecting a decrease in inflation and an economic slowdown in 2024. He believes that this will cause central banks to lower interest rates again but that the time frame in which this will happen is still uncertain.

Need for Financing

Pauli commented that the refinancing of companies or partial spin-offs in connection with restructurings are important topics. He therefore expects growth in the areas of loans and bond issues in corporate banking.

«When it comes to the M&A business we’re currently still clearly in a buyer’s market» Pauli said. «I’ve rarely seen such a difficult market for IPOs and I’m more optimistic for 2024.»

Companies Review Banking Relationships

The industry is expecting many companies to reevaluate their banking relationships in the next few months. UBS’s acquisition of Credit Suisse plays a key role here too. Counterparty risk cluster risk and diversification will be a factor in the reevaluation. Citi (Switzerland) for example also recently said that the changes in the market mean that there is more room for competitors."

BNY Mellon is increasing the hourly base rate employees will be paid beginning March 2024 to $22.50 per hour according to a press release from the bank Friday. That's a 12.5% increase from the previous rate of $20 per hour.

The bank will also offer all eligible new employees stock in the company and health insurance plans with zero-premium coverage for workers making less than $75000 per year.

Bank employees will also have access to additional mental health care resources and 16 weeks of paid leave regardless of gender after employees or their spouses give birth adopt or become surrogate or foster parents to children.

BNY Mellon chose to ""invest in our culture"" by expanding worker benefits and incentives Sharyn Jones the bank's global head of talent said in a statement.

""We want our employees to feel valued and know that they are being compensated competitively"" Jones said in the statement.

Starting before the COVID-19 pandemic a tightening U.S. labor market has pitted banks against one another in recruiting and retaining employees. Similar to any given price battle when a prominent bank has announced higher wages or new benefits others in the industry have followed.

In 2019 for example JPMorgan Chase increased its base rate from $16.50 to $20 per hour. Within two years regional banks including BMO Harris Bank in Chicago and Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Services set an $18-per-hour minimum wage.

And last year following an announcement that Bank of America would begin paying workers a minimum $22 per hour JPMorgan and Charlotte North Carolina-based Truist Financial matched that rate.

Earnings Why TD Bank is cutting 3% of its workforce Expenses at Canada's second-biggest bank are higher than they should be and the layoffs are one part of a plan to control costs going forward executives say. Other Canadian banks including CIBC Scotiabank and BMO have also shed workers this year. December 1

However BNY Mellon's pay increase also comes after some banks have announced plans to cut expenses including layoffs.

In April BofA reduced its employee head count by around 1000 and projected that further cuts later in the year would lower its costs by up to $500 million. And last month Associated Banc-Corp in Wisconsin said it had laid off more than 4000 employees  while New York-based Citigroup informed workers about upcoming layoffs .

At BNY Mellon the bank agreed with the U.S. Department of Labor last year to pay $1.9 million in back wages and interest to resolve allegations of pay discrimination against minority workers in the bank's technology services group.

In recent months BNY Mellon and more than 30 other companies have been sued for noncompliance with new labor laws in Washington state requiring employers to state a job listing's wage scale or salary range.

The case against BNY Mellon seeks class-action certification.

""We are unable to comment on pending litigation"" a BNY Mellon spokesperson said in an emailed statement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndweGkuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYm55LW1lbGxvbi11cHMtbWluaW11bS13YWdlLWV4cGFuZHMtYmVuZWZpdHMvRkFVREpWWUhBUkRNN0NWN1dHS0xMSzRSWEkv0gF3aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud3B4aS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9ibnktbWVsbG9uLXVwcy1taW5pbXVtLXdhZ2UtZXhwYW5kcy1iZW5lZml0cy9GQVVESlZZSEFSRE03Q1Y3V0dLTExLNFJYSS8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,BNY Mellon ups minimum wage expands benefits,"We’re Sorry!

The quaint village of Saltford nestled between the bustling cities of Bristol and Bath is more than just a passing point along the A4 Bath Road. Despite its location on a key route it boasts a tight-knit community where ""everyone knows each other and feels like they belong"".

Once perceived as lacking identity Saltford has transformed into a thriving hub for families couples and young people. Over the past decade the village has embraced numerous changes evident in the 'sold' signs dotting almost every street corner. Its prime position along a busy A-road and the scenic Bristol Bath railway path make it an attractive place to settle down.

Saltford offers a diverse range of homes from luxury properties with expansive driveways and mechanical gates to charming cottages adorned with plants and flowers. It also houses hidden architectural gems like the grade II listed Saltford House believed to have been built in the 1700s by architect Thomas Bennett for his personal use.

Like any desirable location house prices in Saltford reflect its growing popularity. However data from Rightmove indicates that the overall average price of homes there was £492222 over the last year marking a 10 per cent decrease from the previous year reports Bristol Live.

According to Rightmove's records ""The majority of sales in Saltford during the last year were semi-detached properties selling for an average price of £487400. Detached properties sold for an average of £571500 with terraced properties fetching £425000.""

Saltford offers easy access to Keynsham's town centre with a mere stroll and city centres and rural pubs are just a short drive away. The public transport system is quite capable with two primary services between Bristol and Bath the X39 and 39 still running every half hour into the pre-dawn hours despite the 2023 bus cuts that affected other areas. Additionally there's the A4 an hourly airport service.

Saltford also boasts places like The Riverside Inn on the banks of the River Avon and Thai Cafe on Bath Road offering delectable meal options. Though Thai Cafe primarily serves scrumptious Thai food in the evenings it has become such an integral part of the community that it invites people in for a daytime cuppa.

During a 2022 visit Nikki the proprietor of Thai Cafe shared: ""Saltford has become the place to be. Everyone knows each other and helps each other out.""

""I have been here for about 20 years. It used to be mostly retired people who lived here but we are getting more families and young people now.""

Nikki pointing to the restaurant's interior expressed her gratitude for local support: ""People around the village have helped to make the restaurant what it is today. If something is broken someone will help and fix it.""

She continued to praise the community spirit saying ""People in the community helped me to get the restaurant up and running when we had to shut for eight months. Everyone is so nice and so helpful. That's what makes the village so great the people in it. I feel like I belong.""

Highlighting the perks of village life Nikki added ""In Saltford you have things like parking space. You don't get that in most cities. I also know that if I walk home at 10pm from work I will be safe. You don't get antisocial behaviour around here.""

Overlooking the bustling Bath Road Thai Cafe benefits from the traffic calming measures. ""Luckily traffic is slowed down because of the traffic lights"" Nikki remarked.

""We do get a lot of cars go by but people have to get to work and we understand that. Those people the people that drive through the village aren't the people that live here.""

As the warmer months roll in Saltford becomes a haven for wild swimmers kayakers and paddleboarders boasting a picturesque marina and the Bristol Avon Sailing Club making it a perfect destination for water enthusiasts.

Salford Parish Council is at the helm of addressing local concerns in the village. A spokesperson for the Parish Council shared with BristolLive their pride in the community stating: ""Many people who live and work in the village make Saltford a great place to be through their voluntary contributions which are celebrated annually through the Saltford Parish Council Community Awards. Much of the community activity is centred around Saltford Hall run by the Saltford Community Association.""

""Saltford is fortunate to have a community run Post Office and library on the A4 Bath Road as well as many active commercial businesses based around the village. Saltford is surrounded by green belt land which preserves its rural setting; care of the local environment is a matter close to many villagers' hearts as shown by the many members of the Saltford Environment Group and Saltford Wombles.""

""The village is served by the Bristol to Bath Railway Path which is popular with walkers and cyclists alike. As a rural community Saltford Parish Council welcomes considerate visitors who follow the countryside code who leave no trace of their visit by taking their litter home or use one of the many bins around the village. Saltford's residents appreciate considerate parking by visitors and use of public transport is strongly encouraged due to limited parking in the village.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzEyL3VwdG93bi1hcGFydG1lbnRzLXVudmVpbGVkLWluLXJlZGV2ZWxvcGVkLWRvd250b3duLWJhdGgtYmxvY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uptown apartments unveiled in redeveloped downtown Bath block,"The Midcoast’s housing crunch eased slightly this month as developers unveiled 60 new Bath apartments geared toward senior residents.

The new apartment complex called The Uptown features 60 mostly one-bedroom apartments for tenants aged 55 and older. The apartments are for mixed-income households with rents ranging between $794 and $1495 per month. Around 42 apartments are classified as low-income according to developer The Szanton Company.

A large crowd gathered for the grand opening of the redeveloped Moses and Columbia Block Buildings on the corner of Front and Summer streets on May 8.

“There’s a housing shortage here and everywhere in Maine so the fact that we have one unit still available before we even open our doors speaks to the need for housing” said The Szanton Company Vice President Amy Cullen.

Around 10 existing units were already open in the Moses and Columbia building with Szanton adding four more units there Cullen said.

Applications for The Uptown opened in January with the apartments filling up in about one month leaving just one unit available at the time of the grand opening. The new tenants started moving into The Uptown on May 10.

“There is a housing crisis in the state and Bath is no exception” said Bath City Council Chairperson Mary Ellen Bell. “The Uptown project builds density in the downtown recreates underutilized space and provides attainable housing for some of our older residents.”

The newest addition of the building that connects to the renovated Columbia and Moses housing block sits on what used to be an empty lot that was once home to the Bath YMCA. Szanton bought the historic Moses and Columbia blocks back in 2020 with construction beginning in the summer of 2022 according to Cullen.

“The rehab of the existing historic building Moses and Columbia block that this project contains had a lot more work than we expected” Cullen said.

Most of the new tenants come from the Bath area with some coming in from out of state.

“For years to come these affordable homes are going to be a remarkable and lasting tribute to those who have worked so hard for affordable housing in this City of Ships” said MaineHousing Director Daniel Brennan.

Baxter Health CEO Ron Peterson revealed that the Mountain Home Arkansas-based health system is leaning into employee attrition to mitigate costs related to workforce.

There are advantages and disadvantages to utilizing attrition which is why hospital CEOs must be careful how they do it be transparent with their approach and have a keen understanding of their employees to forecast how it will affect their workforce.

In an interview with local radio station KTLO Peterson dispelled rumors of massive layoffs at Baxter Health and shared how it is using attrition to its advantage to remain financially viable as a rural system.

""We have been working very hard on trying to reduce our costs"" Peterson said. ""We've been looking since about July to try to reduce the number of FTEs or the number of people working at the hospital. We've been able to eliminate through attrition which means basically as somebody quits their employment at the hospital for whatever reason if they retire if they get a new job then we don't refill those positions.""

According to Peterson Baxter Health has been able to not refill 155 of those vacant positions contributing to less reliance on FTEs.

However that strategy has created a need for Baxter Health to shift some employees around into new roles.

""Now what we're getting into is we need to restructure and reorganize so we're asking some employees to not continue in their current position but to look at the positions that are open in the hospital and take something that they're qualified for in a different department or different area of the hospital"" he said.

""It causes a little tension because employees are saying 'Oh I don't have my job.' Really we've notified those people and it's affected about nine people in the organization.""

This approach to workforce challenges requires a buy-in and willingness from employees to not only fill different roles as needed but potentially pick up additional responsibilities that would usually be reserved for those positions that are going unfilled. With burnout already being rampant in healthcare putting more on the plate of your employees can quickly backfire.

Peterson said that the employees that have transfered to new roles have kept their seniority and benefits though which could help Baxter Health retain those workers beyond the immediate future.

""We just find that our strength is in our people"" he said. ""We don't want to just lay people off that's not our goal. We want to try to keep as many people as we can. That's why we're going through the process that we're going through the process we're going through versus a massive layoff.""

Despite facing financial difficulties Peterson stated Baxter Health has no interest in selling the hospital and wants to remain independent.

Making attrition work in its favor may allow Baxter Health to keep its doors open for now but CEOs should be careful of delving into 'quiet cutting' territory. This is where transparency is vital and will be beneficial long term even if making employees aware of your intentions means you will lose some in the process.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MyNC5jb20vY2l0eXByZXNzL25ld3Mvc3Bhci1ncm91cC1wdW1wcy1yNy1taWxsaW9uLWludG8tZ2J2LXByZXZlbnRpb24tZWZmb3J0cy0yMDIzMTIwMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SPAR Group pumps R7 million into GBV-prevention efforts | City Press,"NEWS

After the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced an investigation into reports of leaks breakages and other quality issues with China-made plastic syringes New Jersey-based medical technology companies are assuring the public that their devices are manufactured domestically and safe.

Following the Nov. 30 notice – in which the agency advised patients and health care providers to use syringes made outside of China until its review is complete – Franklin Lakes-headquartered medtech Becton Dickinson and Co. (BD) and Parsippany-based global diabetes business Embecta Corp. (embecta) issued statements that they’re both ready to boost production to support those affected by the probe.

Eric Borin president of BD Medication Delivery Solutions said “Essentially all plastic syringes BD provides to the U.S. health care system are manufactured in the United States in Nebraska and Connecticut. BD remains committed to supporting the U.S. health care system and is ready to increase production to help supply those providers who currently purchase syringes impacted by the FDA communication.”

Borin added “Ensuring the safety and quality of our products is the top priority at BD. We have been supporting health care needs with needles and syringes since the inception of our company in 1897 and have provided these products to the U.S. health care system through two world wars the Polio vaccination trials and multiple pandemics – most recently manufacturing 2 billion additional syringes for COVID-19 vaccinations. BD stands ready to deploy our capacity to support the U.S. health care system and patients.”

Embecta – which is the world’s largest manufacturer of plastic insulin syringes and a former subsidiary of BD – produces all of its syringes at a facility in Holdrege Neb. according to Shaun Curtis senior vice president Global Manufacturing & Supply Chain.

“In the coming year embecta will mark 100 years since our predecessors developed the world’s first syringe dedicated to insulin delivery and we are proud of our rich heritage of quality reliability and innovation that we have earned in the years since. Our skilled workforce in Nebraska with its unmatched expertise in high volume syringe manufacturing is prepared to support any healthcare customers who may be affected by the FDA’s safety communication” he said.

According to the FDA recent changes made to the plastic syringe dimensions during production at various manufacturing sites in China has led to quality issues which may affect health providers’ ability to deliver the correct dose of medication when used alone or with other medical devices like infusion pumps.

The agency says it is working with federal partners to further test syringes made in China as well as manufacturers “to ensure adequate corrective actions are taken” but may prevent the devices from entering the U.S. market if necessary.

The FDA is also recommending patients and providers check the manufacturing location of syringes by reviewing the labeling outer packaging or contacting one’s supplier or group purchasing organization. If an individual only has syringes made in China the FDA says they can be used “as needed until you are able to use alternative syringes and closely monitor for leaks breakage and other problems.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGVzdW5jaHJvbmljbGUvbmFtZS9kYW5pZWwtZnJlZWRtYW4tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NTM3MDk4ODXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Daniel Freedman Obituary (1954 - 2023) - Norton MA - Sun Chronicle,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/thesunchronicle/name/daniel-freedman-obituary?id=53709885 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy90aGVzdW5jaHJvbmljbGUvbmFtZS9kYW5pZWwtZnJlZWRtYW4tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NTM3MDk4ODXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

(AP) — An attorney for the billionaire Haslam family called bribery allegations leveled by Warren Buffett’s company a “wild invention.

But a judge didn’t decide immediately whether those allegations will be resolved at a January trial that should help determine the multibillion-dollar price Berkshire Hathaway might have to pay the Haslams for the rest of the Pilot truck stop chain.

The Haslams and Buffett’s company are accusing each other of manipulating Pilot’s earnings this year to affect the price Berkshire would have to pay for the Haslams’ remaining 20% stake in the company if the family decides to sell.

The Haslam family — which includes Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam and former Tennessee governor Bill Haslam — accused Berkshire last month of trying to understate Pilot’s earnings this year by changing its accounting practices.

Berkshire responded this week with a lawsuit of its own accusing Jimmy Haslam of trying to bribe key Pilot executives with payments several times their annual salaries to inflate the company’s profits.

“We called Berkshire’s allegations wild inventions in our opposition brief” attorney Anitha Reddy who represents the Haslams said Thursday. “I don’t think we could have been clearer that we dispute them. And if there is any doubt in Berkshire’s mind we think they’re false and we intend to defeat them on whatever schedule the court orders.”

The judge promised to rule by Friday whether Berkshire’s lawsuit can be heard at the same time a trial on Pilot’s original lawsuit is scheduled in January. Berkshire wants the court to prevent the Haslams from exercising their option to sell the rest of the company to Berkshire next year because it says there are so many doubts about the accuracy of Pilot’s 2023 earnings. Even if the judge agrees the Haslams would still have the option to sell in future years under the agreement they signed back in 2017.

Berkshire’s attorney Craig Lavoie argued that it’s crucial to block a sale next year because it will be hard to determine just how much Pilot’s earnings have been effected by the alleged bribes. He said Berkshire believes at least 28 executives — many of whom are involved in buying and selling fuel for the nation’s largest truck stop chain — were offered bribes.

Berkshire said in its lawsuit that it just learned a couple weeks ago about the Haslams’ attempts to bribe executives who used to work for the family at the company Jim Haslam — Jimmy and Bill Haslam’s father — founded before Berkshire became the majority owner at the start of this year. A senior executive who had been promised a bonus revealed that to the current Pilot CEO according to Berkshire.

Lavoie said it’s difficult for Berkshire to sort out what short-term decisions those executives might have made because of the bonuses.

“Mr. Haslam’s side promises have forced the company to investigate and interrogate many of the key employees it relies on today to operate the company” Lavoie said.

When Berkshire bought its initial 38.6% stake in Pilot in 2017 it paid $2.758 billion. This year it paid another $8.2 billion to give it control of 80% of the company and it went on to install a new CEO and chief financial officer. Buffett told Berkshire shareholders this spring that he wishes he could have bought the entire company at once because the price was better in 2017 but the Haslams wouldn’t sell it all then.

Pilot’s chain of more than 850 locations and roughly 30000 employees in the United States and Canada has already provided a meaningful boost to Berkshire’s revenue and profits this year.

The Haslams said Berkshire’s decision to shift to something called “pushdown accounting” this year forced Pilot to take on higher depreciation and amortization costs and that resulted in lower net income. The Haslams were outvoted on that change at Pilot board meetings.

In addition to Pilot Berkshire owns an eclectic assortment of other businesses including Geico insurance BNSF railroad and several major utilities along with a number of smaller manufacturing and retail businesses. It also holds a sizeable stock portfolio with big stakes in Apple Coca-Cola American Express and Bank of America among other holdings.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAxL3dhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0cy1iaWdnZXN0LXB1cmNoYXNlcy1mb3ItYmVya3NoaXJlLWhhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warren Buffett's Biggest Purchases for Berkshire Hathaway Last Quarter Won't Show Up on Its Latest Portfolio Disclosure,"You'll have to dig a bit deeper to see what he has been buying.

When Warren Buffett and his team at Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.25%) (BRK.B -0.26%) make an investment the world pays attention.

There's good reason too. Buffett has a long track record of outperforming the market. Since he took over as chief executive officer of the textile company in 1965 Berkshire Hathaway shareholders have seen the value of their stock increase at an annualized rate of 19.8% double that of the S&P 500.

Institutional investors managing over $100 million in assets must disclose their holdings at the end of every quarter and Berkshire's stock was worth about $318 billion at the end of the third quarter.

But the three biggest investments Buffett and the team made last quarter won't show up on Berkshire's most recent disclosure. Here's what they are.

U.S. Treasury bills: $29 billion

By far the biggest change in Berkshire Hathaway's holdings last quarter was a shift in its U.S. Treasury position.

You'll have to dig into Berkshire Hathaway's balance sheet to find this one. But the company's short-term investments in U.S. Treasury bills increased by $29 billion last quarter. There was a clear shift from its cash and cash-equivalents balance which decreased $19 billion.

It's important to note what's really going on under the hood here. Berkshire's cash and cash equivalents include any holdings of U.S. Treasury bills maturing within three months. Its short-term investments in U.S. Treasury bills include bonds maturing in more than three months but still within a year. So the net increase in Treasuries was closer to $10 billion still the company's biggest investment last quarter.

There are two reasons for the shift. First it's a clear sign Buffett Combs and Weschler don't see a lot of stocks worth buying right now. In fact Berkshire has been a net seller of stocks for each of the last four quarters.

Second the yield on the six-month Treasury bill offers a slightly better return than the three-month bill with limited increase in risk. Considering that Berkshire is now holding a record amount of cash and generating billions in free cash flow every quarter parking funds in slightly longer-dated Treasuries to lock in higher yields was a prudent move. It certainly paid off as rates have fallen since the end of September driving bond prices higher.

Mystery stock(s): $1.7 billion

The SEC will occasionally permit confidential treatment for new stock purchases exempting them from the required disclosure. Berkshire received an exemption last quarter and now its biggest stock purchase during the third quarter is a mystery to investors.

There are some things we do know about the mystery stock(s) though. First Buffett and his team invested nearly $1.7 billion into undisclosed stocks last quarter. The only other new purchase disclosed was a small stake in Sirius XM (SIRI 1.43%). That purchase cost at most $75 million. Meanwhile Berkshire's third-quarter report shows $1.7 billion in equity purchases last quarter.

Second it's very likely a business in the financial sector. Berkshire saw the cost basis of its holdings in equity securities in the bank insurance and financial sector increase $1.2 billion in the third quarter. At the same time it sold parts of its stakes in several insurance companies.

The fact that Berkshire requested confidentiality on the stock suggests it's looking to increase its position this quarter. If the company had to disclose its new holding it would very likely send shares of the stock higher which would have made it less attractive to buy more shares.

Berkshire Hathaway: $1.1 billion

The third biggest purchase for Buffett was his own company's stock.

During the third quarter Berkshire Hathaway repurchased $1.1 billion worth of shares. That marks 21 straight quarters in which the company has bought back shares with purchases totaling more than $72 billion in that time.

The Berkshire board revisited the long-held policy that management can only repurchase shares of the company when the stock trades below 120% of book value. After a long spell during which Buffett didn't have the authority to repurchase shares the board agreed to let management buy back shares as long as both Buffett and the late Charlie Munger agreed that the stock traded below its intrinsic value.

There's been no stock Buffett likes to buy more since the change. And it's a good bet he'll continue to buy back shares as he has found few other stocks with much appeal in 2023.

Consistent buybacks make Berkshire Hathaway an appealing stock. All else being equal fewer shares outstanding leads to higher earnings per share. And considering the company's net income is expected to climb over time the buyback makes Berkshire shares that much more of a value for investors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xlZ2FsL2p1ZGdlLW9mZmVycy1iZXJrc2hpcmUtcG9zc2libGUtc3BlZWR5LXRyaWFsLW92ZXItcGlsb3QtZGlzcHV0ZS0yMDIzLTEyLTAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Judge offers Berkshire possible speedy trial over Pilot dispute,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-offers-berkshire-possible-speedy-trial-over-pilot-dispute-2023-12-02/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2xlZ2FsL2p1ZGdlLW9mZmVycy1iZXJrc2hpcmUtcG9zc2libGUtc3BlZWR5LXRyaWFsLW92ZXItcGlsb3QtZGlzcHV0ZS0yMDIzLTEyLTAyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBybmV3c3dpcmUuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvbmV0amV0cy1waWxvdHMtY2FsbC1vdXQtd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtaW4tbmF0aW9uYWwtYWQtMzAyMDAyNjkyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NetJets Pilots Call Out Warren Buffett in National Ad,"NJASAP questions whether NetJets owners are getting the value that should accompany the brand's premium price tag. Post this

As the competition to retain talented aviators amid a deepening labor crisis escalates NetJets' stance has left the Union baffled. In the ad NJASAP emphasizes NetJets' refusal to invest in its pilots – the group that plays the most direct role in delivering the brand's product – and questions whether owners are getting the value that should arguably accompany the Fractional's premium price tag. Unsurprisingly hundreds of pilots have left the company this year alone to pursue more lucrative careers elsewhere in the aviation industry and NJASAP expects the pace of attrition to accelerate rapidly in the first quarter of 2024.

""Right now we are seeing a trend unfold that is almost unheard of in aviation: Pilots in the middle of their careers with decades of experience are leaving to start at the bottom of seniority lists at mainline carriers that recognize the value of retaining talented aviators"" NJASAP President Capt. Pedro Leroux said. ""An unscheduled operation as dynamic as NetJets demands high-caliber aviators: Owners pay for the peace of mind that comes from having two experienced pilots seated on the flight deck but right now we are seeing quality pilots across the seniority spectrum leave the Fractional and both Berkshire Hathaway and NetJets executives are seemingly just fine with that.""

At the bargaining table NetJets has never claimed it cannot afford to pay market-rate wages for pilot labor or to make other competitive adjustments to the pilots' contract – only that it is unwilling to do so. Importantly overdue adjustments to scheduling practices would help ensure the pilot group – the men and women who fly the world's wealthiest people to some of the most remote and challenging locations in the world – have more manageable duty periods.

""Throughout the bargaining process pilot negotiators have worked with tremendous focus and intention to craft proposals that would make real improvements to life on the road while addressing the company's concerns"" NJASAP Negotiating Committee Chairman Capt. Mike Pascalar said. ""The company however refused to budge despite our commitment to explore creative solutions and to engage them in that process through joint working sessions."" Importantly the company rejected this approach and the competitive adjustments necessary to keep experienced pilots at NetJets as Berkshire Hathaway sits on a record-breaking $157.2 billion cash pile .

""Although Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway tout NetJets as a luxury private air carrier they are offering budget compensation to the pilot group"" NJASAP Vice President Capt. Paulette Gilbert said. As NJASAP made clear in the ad NetJets pilots are not content to earn 60% of what their JetBlue United and Delta peers will make across a 30-year career. ""Excellent pilots are moving on and we expect more to follow"" Gilbert said adding ""If even half of the pilots who have expressed their intention to move on in one year's time do so NJASAP has no idea how NetJets will manage to keep its promise of providing exceptional experiences to owners. We would be very interested in hearing their thoughts on that.""

Not content to sit by and watch the carrier become a steppingstone NetJets pilots continue to place public pressure on the company Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway including recently hosting informational pickets in Las Vegas and on Wall Street . The pilots are scheduled to convene their next informational picket on Friday Dec. 8 at 1300ET in conjunction with Art Basel in Miami.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has claimed that the Haslam family tried to bribe executives at the Pilot truck stop chain. In a counter-lawsuit Berkshire also alleges that the Haslams paid millions of dollars to inflate the company's profits this year.

If successful the Haslams could potentially force Berkshire to pay more for their remaining 20% stake in the company which is valued at around $3.2 billion. Berkshire recently became the majority owner of the company earlier this year.

The Haslam family which includes Cleveland Browns managing partner Jimmie Haslam and former Tennessee governor Bill Haslam had initially sued Berkshire Hathaway for allegedly attempting to understate Pilot's earnings this year by changing its accounting practices.

According to the Associated Press Berkshire claims that ""Jimmy Haslam offered to personally pay bonuses to the executives that would far exceed their annual salaries based on the price the family received for its remaining stake.""

The offer was reportedly made at a country club dinner in Knoxville Tennessee in March and was repeated to at least four other high-level executives. The former CEO of Pilot also extended the offer to at least 10 other executives in April according to Berkshire's filing.

""Those are wild inventions"" say the lawyers

In response to these allegations attorney for the Haslam family Anitha Reddy stated ""We called Berkshire's allegations wild inventions in our opposition brief. I don't think we could have been clearer that we dispute them. And if there is any doubt in Berkshire's mind we think they're false and we intend to defeat them on whatever schedule the court orders.""

The original lawsuit is scheduled to take place sometime in January. Both parties will have the opportunity to present their arguments and evidence before a decision is made.

This case has attracted significant attention due to the involvement of high-profile individuals and the large sums of money at stake. The accusations of bribery and financial manipulation have serious implications for both the Haslam family and Berkshire Hathaway. It remains to be seen how this legal battle will unfold and what impact it will have on the future of the Pilot truck stop chain."

Weaknesses: Market saturation and dependence on consumer electronics volatility.

Opportunities: Expansion of service offerings and growth in e-commerce.

Threats: Intense competition and rapid technological changes.

Best Buy Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) the largest pure-play consumer electronics retailer in the U.S. reported consolidated fiscal 2023 sales of $46.3 billion. With a significant market share and a strong foothold in both online and offline sales channels Best Buy has established itself as a leader in the consumer electronics industry. The company's recent 10-Q filing dated December 1 2023 provides a detailed financial overview revealing a decrease in comparable sales across various categories yet an increase in gross profit rate due to improved membership offerings and favorable product margin rates. Despite a decline in overall revenue Best Buy's strategic investments in e-commerce and omnichannel capabilities have positioned it well for the evolving retail landscape.

Decoding Best Buy Co Inc (BBY): A Strategic SWOT Insight

Strengths

Market Leadership and Brand Equity: Best Buy's dominant market presence and strong brand equity are significant strengths. The company's market share of roughly 8.5% in the U.S. and over 35% in offline sales underscores its leadership position. Best Buy's brand is synonymous with consumer electronics which helps attract and retain customers. The brand's equity is built on a foundation of extensive product offerings knowledgeable staff and a reputation for quality customer service.

Omnichannel Retail Strategy: Best Buy's investments in e-commerce fulfillment particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic have paid off with the U.S. e-commerce channel doubling from pre-pandemic levels. The company's ability to seamlessly integrate in-store and online shopping experiences including options for in-store pickup and curbside delivery has been a key differentiator. This omnichannel approach not only enhances customer convenience but also drives sales across channels.

Financial Resilience: Best Buy's financial health is a testament to its operational efficiency and strategic planning. The company's balance sheet reflects a strong financial position with a gross profit rate increase in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. This improvement is attributed to enhanced membership offerings and lower supply chain costs indicating a robust margin management strategy.

Weaknesses

Market Saturation: Best Buy operates in a highly saturated market where growth opportunities are limited by the number of potential new customers and the high penetration of consumer electronics. This saturation can lead to increased competition and price wars which may erode profit margins and market share.

Story continues

Dependence on Consumer Electronics: Best Buy's heavy reliance on consumer electronics sales makes it vulnerable to industry volatility. Fluctuations in product demand rapid technological changes and the cyclical nature of consumer electronics can impact revenue and profitability. Diversification into other product categories or services could mitigate this risk.

Operational Challenges: The company faces operational challenges such as managing inventory levels and adapting to changing consumer preferences. The recent decrease in comparable sales across key categories like appliances computing and mobile phones indicates a need for Best Buy to reassess its product mix and marketing strategies to better align with current market trends.

Opportunities

Service Offerings Expansion: Best Buy has the opportunity to expand its service offerings such as technical support and product installation to differentiate itself from competitors. Services provide higher margins than product sales and can enhance customer loyalty. The growth in service-related comparable sales particularly in delivery and installation suggests a promising avenue for revenue diversification.

E-commerce Growth: The continued growth of e-commerce presents an opportunity for Best Buy to further capitalize on its digital sales channels. With online sales comprising a significant portion of revenue there is potential for Best Buy to enhance its online platform improve customer engagement and drive sales growth through targeted digital marketing campaigns.

International Expansion: While Best Buy's presence is predominantly in the U.S. international markets offer untapped potential. The company's experience and success in the U.S. can be leveraged to expand into new geographic regions potentially driving growth and reducing reliance on the domestic market.

Threats

Intense Competition: Best Buy faces intense competition from both brick-and-mortar retailers and online giants like Amazon. Competitors with aggressive pricing strategies broader product assortments or superior online platforms could capture market share and pressure Best Buy's sales and profitability.

Rapid Technological Changes: The consumer electronics industry is characterized by rapid technological advancements. Best Buy must continuously adapt its product offerings to keep pace with the latest trends and consumer demands. Failure to do so could result in lost sales and reduced relevance in the market.

Economic Sensitivity: Consumer electronics are often considered discretionary purchases making Best Buy's sales sensitive to economic conditions. Economic downturns or shifts in consumer spending patterns can lead to reduced demand for Best Buy's products impacting its financial performance.

In conclusion Best Buy Co Inc (NYSE:BBY) exhibits a strong market presence and a robust omnichannel strategy which are key strengths in the competitive consumer electronics landscape. However the company must navigate weaknesses such as market saturation and dependence on a volatile industry. Opportunities for growth lie in expanding service offerings and capitalizing on e-commerce trends while threats from intense competition and rapid technological changes loom. Best Buy's ability to leverage its strengths and address its weaknesses while seizing opportunities and mitigating threats will be crucial for its continued success.

But none of them indie or big time have managed to beat Valve on value. The Deck’s $400 starting price remains unbeaten for an x86-based gaming handheld. Until today. The entry-level version of the Asus ROG Ally a more powerful handheld running an optimized version of Windows is on sale for just $399.99 at Best Buy.

There’s just one potential fly in the soup. This version of the ROG Ally is running the AMD Ryzen Z1 processor not the faster flagship Ryzen Z1 Extreme APU that made the Ally such a splash when it launched earlier this year. So while the hardware is still newer and faster than the Steam Deck it’s to a lesser degree than you might think and running Windows instead of the Linux-based Steam OS creates a lot of operating overhead. If you want the full-fat Extreme version of the Ally it’s also on sale for $599.99 ($100 off the original price instead of $200).

That being said even the base model of the ROG Ally is impressive. The 1080p IPS screen is a big step up over the base model Steam Deck and with 120Hz capability it’s arguably better than the new OLED version too. Both versions of the Ally get 512GB of speedy PCIe 4th-gen storage out of the box plus whatever you can fit in the microSD card reader. And the Ally can be docked to Asus’s proprietary ROG XG Mobile series of external GPUs if you want to turn it into a full-fledged gaming desktop or entertainment center.

At the time of writing Best Buy seems to be the only retailer running such a dramatic discount on the Ally — competitors like Amazon and Newegg have declined to match the price drop. That being the case you might want to get an order in quickly if you’re ready to buy.

New England Biolabs has released the NEBNext UltraShear FFPE DNA Library Prep Kit (NEB #E6655) a solution for working with challenging formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples in molecular labs. FFPE DNA has long posed difficulties due to its low input amounts non-uniform ends and DNA damage caused by fixation and embedding. However the NEBNext UltraShear FFPE DNA Library Prep Kit offers a streamlined user-friendly workflow that minimises hands-on time and addresses these challenges.

The kit incorporates the NEBNext FFPE DNA Repair Mix v2 designed to selectively target damaged DNA bases and enhance data accuracy while improving library conversion rates. It effectively rectifies issues like nicks gaps and overhangs resulting in good library quality.

Additionally the NEBNext UltraShear FFPE DNA Library Prep Kit prevents over-fragmentation and retains intact DNA by filling in single-stranded overhangs that are free from damage enabling optimal sequencing coverage. Importantly the kit preserves true mutations while removing damaged bases preventing false-positive results in mutation analysis.

The kit offers a sample-quality-agnostic workflow with a broad input range making it suitable for high-throughput settings such as clinical labs. Enzymatic fragmentation is automation-friendly and less dependent on sample quality providing consistent results.

With the NEBNext UltraShear FFPE DNA Library Prep Kit researchers can unlock valuable genetic insights from FFPE samples — regardless of their quality or quantity — putting an end to compromised library preparation and sequencing results and resulting in efficient and consistent FFPE DNA analysis.

The running shoe world is always abuzz with the arrival of a new contender and the R.A.D. R-1 could be about to make waves since its debut this year. Emerging from the realms of CrossFit-centric footwear R.A.D. takes its first strides into the running shoe arena with the R-1.



After reading the specs for the R-1 and getting my first glimpse of the shoe it was clear R.A.D had three things in mind: sustainability design and comfort.

The main standout feature of this running shoe is the midsole. The R-1s midsole is powered by R.A.D.'s groundbreaking SwellFoam N2 technology. Comprising a 50/50 blend of cane and fossil composition it marks a 20% bio increase from the R.A.D One training shoe's SwellFoam. This unique foam mix is designed to deliver next level cushioning for your long runs. The midsole also incorporates something called Bubble-tech which is composed of nitrogen bubbles for a lightweight midsole and noticeable energy return. But how did these innovative features fare up when I put the shoes to the test?



While trying to build up my base levels again before beginning marathon training I tested the R.A.D R-1s during a variety of runs including interval work one tempo session two long runs and various easy miles. Read my full R.A.D R-1 running shoe review below and see how they compare to the best running shoes.

R.A.D R-1 review: Price and availability

Retailing at $160/£150 R.A.Ds first running shoe can be bought in a Men's size 4.5 to 14 and a Women's 6 to 15.5. With 11 colorways to choose from ranging from the understated Black to the vibrant FTC Red the R-1 is set to cater to diverse tastes.

R.A.D. suggests that this shoe fits true to size but to size up by 0.5 if you usually do in running shoes. But If you’re ever unsure about sizing read our how to buy running shoes guide here. At the time of writing you can only buy the R-1 running shoes from the R.A.D website we will update here if they become available through other retailers.

R.A.D R-1 review: Design and fit

Let's start with the basics. I opted for my usual size during testing and found the fit to be spot-on supporting the idea that true-to-size is the way to go with the R-1.



If you were to tell me that a brand best known for CrossFit shoes is planning to create a running shoe the R-1 is exactly what I'd envision. That may sound silly but the R-1's are not as extravagant looking as some popular running shoes appear (like the On Cloudmonsters) and are subtle enough in appearance to pass as a training shoe in the gym. However the chunky and rounded sole does give the game away that they are in fact designed for running.



SwellFoam N2 is R.A.D's answer to a cutting-edge midsole tech for running shoes that incorporates sugar cane actively capturing carbon during growth reducing reliance on less eco-friendly materials. With a 50/50 cane/fossil composition blend it marks a 20% bio increase from the R.A.D One training shoe's SwellFoam.

Upper

The upper is crafted from a visually intriguing 3D looking mesh featuring horizontal lines that I felt enhanced both structure and breathability. Around the toe heel and lateral sections of the shoe there is a TPU film strategically placed to help with durability in areas where wear and tear is more common.

The entrance to the shoe features a soft foam enveloping the ankle and foot and ensuring a comfortable fit. There is also a little additional cushioning in the heel cup area which helped prevent any unwanted foot movement during testing. The tongue is gusseted and made from an airy mesh material which provides cushioning and allows for a snug fit without causing discomfort. However the Achilles heel of the design lies in the laces which I found frequently came undone mid-run and got a bit annoying during my tempo and interval training runs when pausing to retie my laces wasn't on the agenda.

Midsole:

The heart of the R-1 lies in its midsole as we've already touched on it's powered by R.A.D.'s proprietary SwellFoam N2 technology. This supercritical foam midsole not only should deliver cushioning for long runs but is also supposed to exhibit the necessary responsiveness for tempo and interval sessions. Plus the use of nitrogen bubbles in the foaming process is designed to create a lighter-weight midsole with enhanced energy return. While I definitely enjoyed the soft cushioned feel of the shoe on my easy and long runs I'm afraid I can't say the same for any runs where I needed to pick up the pace.



I tried finishing a speedy-ish 5K in my first two runs with the shoes and felt I was working harder than I have to when I wear my On Cloudmonsters or go-to Parkrun shoe the Hoka Kawana. It was a similar story when I came to wear the R-1's during a tempo session or for interval training. I felt like I was stomping my way along rather than bouncing seamlessly from one foot to another. However I did feel really comfortable in the R-1's during my long runs and will be returning to them for long casual chatty runs in the future.

Outsole:

The outsole is relatively simple in its design with four rubber pieces. Two weeks into testing the R-1's and as expected so soon on no sign of wear was evident. However once these sections do begin to wear away you'll find yourself running directly on the midsole. That being said it reminds me of the bottom of the Hoka Rincon and they seem to hold up just fine from what I've heard from fellow runners.

R.A.D R-1 Run Performance:

Initial impressions during speed sessions and interval runs did leave me questioning the R-1's prowess. It seemed to demand more effort to maintain pace than some competitors. However as my testing progressed into longer runs and easy miles the shoe's potential began to shine for me in the form of reliable cushioning.

The upper provided excellent lockdown and ventilation. I have only tested these shoes in winter conditions but I'm holding out for the R-1s to become a trusty long distance running shoe in summer with its breathable upper.

The R-1 ended up being a comfortable plush option for easy miles and extended outings. However it lacks the specialized features necessary for speed and tempo runs. While not designed as a performance powerhouse it serves well for casual runs or those seeking a comfortable companion for lengthy excursions.

R.AD R-1 review: Verdict

For runners seeking a plush comfortable experience on easy miles and extended outings the R-1 is a solid choice. Casual runners and those prioritizing comfort over speed will find a reliable companion in these shoes. With that being said this is quite a pricy shoe. Had I found design features like the Bubble Tech to have delivered greater energy return or the Swellfoam to provide more bounce I definitely would be more in favor of the price.

The R.A.D. R-1 earns its stripes as a casual running shoe but sadly doesn't stand out as a solid shoe choice for energy return or bounce. I'm excited to see where R.A.D goes with running wear now that it has entered the scene.

Sean: Just like 2022 the story of 2023 has been about the Fed. We have seen four rate hikes year-to-date in addition to the seven hikes last year which has driven the Fed Funds rate to a 22-year high.1 As a result the benchmark 10-year Treasury which began the year at 3.88% has continued to increase most recently trading at 4.92%.2 This increase in rates along with lack of demand has driven lackluster performance in the municipal sector—the broad Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index is down 1.86% year-to-date3 compared to the taxable bond market with the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond index down 3.04% year-to-date.

Not surprisingly long maturity munis have largely driven the negative returns this year given their sensitivity to rising interest rates. We’ve observed that investors have been cautious about committing money to fixed income given the volatile rate environment. As such dampened demand for munis has led to outflows from municipal bond funds for most of this year.4 While markets believe the Fed is fast approaching or has already reached the end of its hiking cycle the Fed has indicated rates will likely stay high for an extended period of time.

Historically early autumn weakness in munis has given way to strong performance into year-end performance. Over the past five years November and December have produced a combined total return of 219 basis points per year on average.5",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndhdGVyc3RlY2hub2xvZ3kuY29tL3RyYWRpbmctdGVjaC83OTUxNTA5L3doYXQtaXMtYWxhZGRpbi10cmFkZXItYmxhY2tyb2Nrcy1maXhlZC1pbmNvbWUtdG9vbC1zdGlsbC1hLW15c3RlcnnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What is Aladdin Trader?

ALTÉRRA and the asset manager have formed a partnership to create the BlackRock Climate Transition Vehicle. Within this $1bn will be invested into BlackRock’s Climate Transition-Oriented Private Debt strategy a new private debt strategy focused on the low-carbon transition. It will finance a range of middle market companies primarily in Europe and the US which demonstrate climate transition characteristics.

A second $1bn will be allocated to transition-related infrastructure through BlackRock’s infrastructure equity strategies. This includes $650m committed to the BlackRock Global Infrastructure Fund IV which invests in decarbonisation-related infrastructure assets. The other $350m will be invested in infrastructure in the Global South via a public-private finance vehicle focused on investing in climate-related infrastructure in emerging markets.

Described as “the world’s largest private investment vehicle for climate change action” ALTÉRRA aims to mobilise $250bn globally by 2030

Ambassador Majid Al Suwaidi COP28 director-general will serve as ALTÉRRA’s CEO. He said: “ALTÉRRA is a critical element in the UAE’s efforts to create a global green finance ecosystem that stimulates and empowers the growth of a new climate economy. It will build a vibrant climate investment landscape which further catalyses investment into the Global South.

“Our partnership with BlackRock is an important moment for ALTÉRRA and reflects our ambition to use this capital to mobilise at least $250bn of overall investment by 2030. BlackRock brings climate and industry-specific expertise and a broad variety of opportunities to invest in climate-related projects at scale. It is a high-calibre business which has committed to further enhancing its on-the-ground presence in the UAE.”

Larry Fink chairman and CEO at BlackRock added: “BlackRock is honoured to have been selected to participate in this important initiative which will shape the way climate finance evolves in the coming years. The launch of ALTÉRRA will itself not only help mobilise much needed capital to support the transition in the Global South it can also serve as a blueprint for other sovereigns and private sector actors to replicate partnering to help unleash the trillions of dollars needed in developed and emerging markets. We look forward to bringing our expertise in mobilising private sector capital to enable its success.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMDEvdWFlLWNvbW1pdHMtMzAtYmlsbGlvbi10by1uZXctY2xpbWF0ZS1mb2N1c2VkLWZ1bmQtcnVuLXdpdGgtYmxhY2tyb2NrLmh0bWzSAW5odHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMy8xMi8wMS91YWUtY29tbWl0cy0zMC1iaWxsaW9uLXRvLW5ldy1jbGltYXRlLWZvY3VzZWQtZnVuZC1ydW4td2l0aC1ibGFja3JvY2suaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UAE seeks to silence critics with $30-billion climate fund pledge with BlackRock Brookfield,"Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber President of the UNFCCC COP28 Climate Conference attends a press conference following the opening session of the conference on November 30 2023 in Dubai United Arab Emirates.

The pet care–focused company raised hundreds of millions of dollars while private through a Series G and later went public via a SPAC. Notably unlike a great many SPAC combinations Rover is proving that blank-check companies are not merely a way to incinerate wealth.

The Exchange explores startups markets and money.

Read it every morning on TechCrunch+ or get The Exchange newsletter every Saturday.

The former startup has a 30-day shopping provision built into its deal with Blackstone meaning that other offers may come to the fore. However with the private equity group paying a stiff premium for Rover shares — 61% more than the company’s 90-day volume weighted average share price per a release — that doesn’t sound too likely.

The Rover deal is expensive but it has some notable caveats that tell us quite a lot about the state of the market for tech and tech-enabled companies. I’ll bet you didn’t expect a pet-focused e-commerce marketplace to earn an 8.7x revenue run rate multiple in 2023!

This morning I want to dig into why I think Blackstone is paying so much for Rover what we can glean from that research for other startups and why a select few SPAC’d public companies that are trading like literal dogs may be bargains for the right buyer.

That price tag isn’t unreasonable

Rover and Blackstone announced their transaction after we got the former company’s Q3 2023 results meaning that we have pretty up-to-date figures concerning its recent performance.

Rover reported third-quarter revenues of $66.2 million up 30% from the same period one year ago. The company also flipped to GAAP net income and told investors that it intended to buy back more of its own shares. It also beat guidance in the quarter.

Solid right? But the company’s Q3 revenue result puts it on a $264.8 million run rate giving it the previously mentioned nearly 9x revenue multiple. Given that that’s above the average revenue multiple of 7x for public software companies we need to get more information under our belts. From a neutral standpoint pet care marketplaces should not be worth more than enterprise SaaS right? Even with a take-private premium.

Here’s why I think Blackstone is coughing up the dosh to take Rover off the public markets:

Bookings growth: Bookings on Rover grew 26% in the third quarter compared to its result in Q3 2022. Per the company’s earnings call Rover saw “record new customer bookings of 290000 up 8% over last year’s record levels.” That’s nice and bullish; accelerating new customer adds is a great way to build long-term revenues provided that you can keep those customers on the platform.

International: Partially driving Rover’s bookings growth is international demand. Again from the company’s earnings call gross bookings “in Europe grew 71% and 35% in Canada” in the quarter. With international only worth 10% of Rover bookings today it appears that there is a lot of growth yet to be found outside the United States. That’s a nice long-term growth story to consider if you are a PE shop with money to put to work.

That’s a nice long-term growth story to consider if you are a PE shop with money to put to work. Take rate up: How did revenue growth (30%) outpace bookings growth (26%) at Rover? A stronger take rate. That figure came to 23.6% in the third quarter up 120 basis points from its year-ago result of 22.4%. Stronger take rates not only help marketplaces convert bookings to revenue more efficiently but they also imply pricing leverage in-market for Rover itself. That’s very bullish.

ABV up: On the same theme Rover’s average booking value (ABV) rose 4% year-over-year to $142. Quick customer growth stronger take rates and larger order basket sizes? It’s a winsome combination for a marketplace to report.

On the same theme Rover’s average booking value (ABV) rose 4% year-over-year to $142. Quick customer growth stronger take rates and larger order basket sizes? It’s a winsome combination for a marketplace to report. Higher long-term profit margin floor: As a result of the company’s financial performance Rover is reconsidering its long-term profitability with CEO Aaron Easterly saying:

We were able to continue investing in product and marketing while increasing adjusted EBITDA margin from 20% in the prior year to 26% this year. These results suggest that the lower bound of our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target should be higher than the 30% that we have previously communicated and we are evaluating how much to increase it.

Raising guidance: And to close out Rover raised its revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year.

Rover is worth such a premium revenue multiple in 2023 because it has a super-solid growth story (international) improving core economics (better take rate larger orders) and sufficient profitability to invest excess cash flow into shareholder return. For Blackstone it looks like a company that is going to grow quickly while owned while generating enough cash to either look to grow even faster or to allow for a fat dividend to be extracted in the form of attached debt.

Rover looks rock-solid and with its future bright Blackstone had to cough up to take it off the public markets. For any startup that has yet to go public and is considering looking for a PE buyer note how strong Rover looks across pretty much every metric we might want to consider in its value. And it had a strong forward posture and lots of cash which meant that it did not have to sell and could demand payment today for the value it would create in the coming quarters. Folks like to own winners in other words.

Notably Rover is not the only Not Shit SPAC. Back when the pet care marketplace was prepping to go out via a SPAC we covered its blank-check deck at the same time that we looked at MoneyLion’s own. Both companies eventually went out and thus we have data from MoneyLion as well.

However while Rover is seeing its valuations fortune recover and then some MoneyLion has struggled:

So is MoneyLion a dog and not a dog-walker? Not really. Yes the company did grow more slowly in its most recent quarter (22%) than it forecasted (24% to 30%) but it also posted record revenues of $110 million in Q3 2023 record loan originations and record gross profit. Even more the company posted its third consecutive quarter of adjusted EBITDA profit expanding its margin thereof from 9% in Q2 2023 to 12% in Q3 2023. Throw in positive operating and investing cash flows and the company looks just fine.

For about 1x annualized revenues MoneyLion appears to be in the bargain bin. Perhaps some SPACs are really priced to move these days. Expect more take-privates in 2024."

Focus areas include cross-sector collaboration policy advocacy SAF compatibility research and SAF purchases

DUBAI United Arab Emirates Dec 1 2023 — Boeing (NYSE: BA) is accelerating its global efforts to scale-up sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) which serves as the aviation industry’s most significant lever in reducing emissions today and into the future.

Focus areas include Boeing’s efforts to catalyze collaboration research and policy development around SAF which can reduce lifecycle CO 2 up to 85%.

“We’re deepening our collaborative work across the globe in pursuit of a world with more SAF” said Chris Raymond Boeing Chief Sustainability Officer. “SAF holds the greatest potential to reduce aviation’s emissions and we are focused on continuing to innovate and collaborate to unlock the production of sustainable aviation fuel around the world.”

The key challenges to greater use of SAF are the limited supply and high cost. Current use of SAF represents 0.1% of global jet fuel demand.

In the lead up to COP28 Boeing worked together to:

Bring energy producers and aviation leaders in the UAE together to form a consortium called Air-CRAFT to accelerate the research scaling and production of renewable and advanced aviation fuels in the country and beyond.

Launch an initiative with the United States to catalyze the development and use of SAF among Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) member countries.

Announce a collaboration with Zero Petroleum for testing and analyzing the next generation of technologies to accelerate the supply of SAF.

Support discussions at ICAO’s Third Conference on Aviation Alternative Fuels where governments from over 100 countries set a goal that aviation fuel in 2030 should be 5% less carbon intensive than conventional jet fuel.

Join the Corporate Coalition for Innovation & Technology toward Net Zero (CCITNZ) a cross-sector business alliance dedicated to helping countries meet decarbonization and climate change goals through innovation and technology.

Provide technical expertise on the first 100% SAF flight across the Atlantic on a commercial jetliner – a Boeing 787 Dreamliner. This was a Virgin Atlantic-led project supported by funding from the UK Department for Transport.

Sign an agreementwith Masdar the Abu Dhabi-based renewable energy company to advance and support the development and adoption of SAF policies in the UAE and beyond.

Boeing seeks to build on this momentum at COP28 and continue its focus to help scale SAF globally through:

Industry collaboration and policy advocacy : Boeing continues to work with consulting firms academic institutions and non-profit organizations to conduct studies in more than a dozen countries to identify viable pathways for locally produced SAF using local feedstock solutions. One collaboration with the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials explores SAF feedstock opportunities in Southeast Asia Ethiopia South Africa and Brazil.

Advancing renewable energy such as SAF is one of four strategic levers Boeing is pursuing to support the commercial aviation industry’s decarbonization goals. The other levers are fleet renewal advanced technology and operational efficiency.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1kZWZlbnNlL2JvZWluZy1lbGltaW5hdGVkLXVzLWFpci1mb3JjZXMtZG9vbXNkYXktcGxhbmUtY29tcGV0aXRpb24tMjAyMy0xMi0wMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exclusive: Boeing eliminated from US Air Force's 'Doomsday Plane' competition,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/boeing-eliminated-us-air-forces-doomsday-plane-competition-2023-12-01/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2Flcm9zcGFjZS1kZWZlbnNlL2JvZWluZy1lbGltaW5hdGVkLXVzLWFpci1mb3JjZXMtZG9vbXNkYXktcGxhbmUtY29tcGV0aXRpb24tMjAyMy0xMi0wMS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vYnJlYWtpbmdkZWZlbnNlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEyL2JvZWluZy1vdXQtb2YtZS00Yi1kb29tc2RheS1wbGFuZS1yZXBsYWNlbWVudC1jb21wZXRpdGlvbi_SAWRodHRwczovL2JyZWFraW5nZGVmZW5zZS5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi9ib2Vpbmctb3V0LW9mLWUtNGItZG9vbXNkYXktcGxhbmUtcmVwbGFjZW1lbnQtY29tcGV0aXRpb24vP2FtcD0x?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Boeing out of E-4B ‘Doomsday Plane’ replacement competition,"SIMI VALLEY Calif. — Boeing is no longer in the running to build the Air Force’s E-4B Nightwatch “Doomsday” plane replacement leaving Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) as the only known remaining competitor.

In a statement to Breaking Defense on Friday a company spokesperson confirmed that the aerospace giant’s bid is no longer under consideration by the Air Force. Reuters first reported Boeing’s elimination.

“We are approaching all new contract opportunities with added discipline to ensure we can meet our commitments and support the long-term health of our business. We remain confident our [E-4B replacement] approach is the most comprehensive technically mature and lowest-risk solution for the customer and Boeing” the Boeing spokesperson said.

“Our proposal is based on 60 years of military commercial derivative aircraft knowledge and experience including the design development and sustainment of the E-4B Nightwatch which currently serves the national security command and control mission” they added.

According to Reuters Boeing and the Air Force could not reach an agreement on data rights or contract terms. Boeing executives have refused to sign any new fixed-price development contracts after the company has suffered billions of dollars in losses in recent years. In the third quarter of 2023 alone Boeing logged nearly $1 billion in charges for its defense division.

In a statement an Air Force spokesperson said “We cannot discuss an active source selection and detailed program information is classified in order to protect our investment in this critical capability.”

Boeing is the builder of the current E-4B a modified 747 which serves as the Defense Secretary’s primary mode of transportation but can also act as an airborne command center in the event of a national emergency like a nuclear attack. The aircraft is also known as the Survivable Airborne Operations Center or SAOC and four of the jets are currently in the service’s inventory.

The Air Force’s fiscal 2024 budget rollout earlier this year showed a massive jump in funding for the SAOC replacement effort with approximately $889 million for the upcoming fiscal year alone as the service moves toward a contract award. The award is expected in 2024 with SNC now the only public competitor still vying to win it.

Boeing isn’t alone in its opposition to fixed-price development contracts. L3Harris Chief Executive Officer Chris Kubasik for example has vowed that his company will refuse to sign contracts with such terms.

Negotiations between industry and the government on data rights are often sticking points for programs which the government usually seeks to enable service-led maintenance. Boeing’s sustainment arm that services both commercial and defense contracts called Boeing Global Services is typically a bright spot in the company’s earnings posting a profit of $784 million in Q3 of this year.

“We’re having great engagements with our customers. When I say great yeah sometimes it’s painful” Steve Nordlund the head of Boeing’s Air Dominance division told Breaking Defense in an interview earlier this year.

“And sometimes we don’t have the answer right off the top of our head. But we’re digging in to try to figure out how we can get them what they want which is being able to operate.”

A proposed contract will include up to $5.9 billion for a sole-sourced contract for the aircraft and related equipment. The remaining funds will be used for simulators new infrastructure and weapons.

Local business jet manufacturer Bombardier which had hoped to compete for the contract with a heavily modified version of its Global 6500 jet said it was “disappointed” with the decision. News of the deal was no surprise. The Canadian government had reached out to Washington last March about buying the P-8As arguing that Boeing’s aircraft was the only one to meet all its requirements.

Canada plans to 14 P-8As in an initial order and secure an option to buy two more aircraft at a later date. Deliveries of the aircraft will begin in 2026 according to Boeing. Full operational capability is scheduled to be reached by 2033.

The sole-source decision will allow Canada to replace its Aurora fleet years earlier than if Bombardier had to develop and certificate its proposed Global 6500-based jet. Boeing currently has a backlog for 20 P-8As and a dwindling pool of potential customers. Canada needs to make sure it orders the aircraft before Boeing begins shutting down production of the Poseidon in the medium term.

Each week we round up travel startups that have recently received or announced funding . Please email Travel Tech Reporter Justin Dawes at [email protected] if you have funding news.

Seven travel tech startups have raised more than $171 million over the past two weeks.

>>Layla a new generative AI trip planner app has announced its launch and a seed fundraise of $3.3 million (€3 million).

Investors include Paris Hilton Booking.com co-founder Andy Phillips and Skyscanner co-founder Barry Smith. The funding round was led by Firstminute Capital which was established by Lastminute.com co-founder Brent Hoberman as well as the fund M13.

Users can access the trip planner chatbot through the Apple and Android apps or by messaging the Instagram account @justasklayla.

Berlin-based Layla said that the chatbot can deliver a personalized travel plan following a series of prompts and responses. The itinerary could include relevant videos and information about accommodations flight prices cultural insights and weather. The app also enables users to book flights and lodging through Skyscanner and Booking.com.

The startup said the chatbot is informed in part by social media-based travel content which is where many younger travelers turn to get travel advice.

Layla was created by Jeremy Jauncey founder of travel media brand Beautiful Destinations and Saad Saeed co-founder of European grocery delivery service Flink.

“Travel discovery has been broken for decades” Jauncey said in a statement. “People today get inspired by short-form videos on social media first and foremost but there is no way to turn this inspiration into a trip. We want to help users discover the perfect places by bridging the gap between social media planning and booking.”



ZeroAvia: $116 Million

ZeroAvia which is developing a hydrogen-electric jet engine has raised $116 million in series C funding.

It was led by the UK Infrastructure Bank with support from previous co-leads Airbus Barclays Sustainable Impact Capital and NEOM Investment Fund as well as Breakthrough Energy Ventures Horizons Ventures Alaska Airlines Ecosystem Integrity Fund Summa Equity AP Ventures and Amazon Climate Pledge Fund.

ZeroAvia has now raised over $256 million according to Crunchbase. The latest funding amount in September was undisclosed.

Headquartered in the UK and California ZeroAvia said it is developing hydrogen-electric engines that use hydrogen in fuel cells to generate electricity. That electricity is then used to power motors that turn the aircraft’s propellers with water being the only byproduct during flight.

The company is focusing first on engines that support a 300-mile range in aircrafts of nine to 19 seats by the end of 2025. The next focus is on engines that support a range of up to 700 miles in aircrafts with 40-80 seats by 2027. The company said it has signed engineering partnerships with major aircraft manufacturers and has nearly 2000 engine pre-orders from airlines.

The funding will go toward certifying the startup’s first engines and advancing research and development around engines for larger aircrafts.

“Aviation and hydrogen are sectors that need significant private investment to get to net zero” said Ian Brown head of banking and investments at the UK Infrastructure Bank in a statement. “By providing confidence to investors our equity has helped to crowd in the private investment needed for the continued development of this cutting-edge technology and should help stimulate the development and deployment of hydrogen technology across other hard to decarbonise sectors.”

Scapia: $23 Million



Scapia which offers a credit card and app dedicated to Indian travelers has raised $23 million in a series A funding round.

It was led by Elevation Capital and 3STATE Ventures with support from Matrix Partners India and Tanglin Venture Partners.

The Bangalore-based company released a co-branded Visa credit card in partnership with Federal Bank near the time it announced a $9 million fundraise in June.

Benefits of the card include no foreign exchange fees unlimited domestic airport lounge access with a minimum monthly expenditure no annual or joining fees and 10% rewards for all purchases.

The credit card app includes a tool that enables customers to instantly redeem points for flight and hotels bookable through the app the company said.

The capital will go toward growing the startup’s customer base adding more banking partners and strengthening the software product.



@hotel: $4 million

@hotel a consumer booking platform for hotels has raised $4 million.

Investors include former Booking Holdings CEO Jeff Boyd Booking Holdings chairman Robert Mylod PAR Capital Shopify executive Luc Levesque through his fund 20GROWTH Facebook executive David Fischer Instagram lead Morgan Brown and others.

BeCause which helps travel companies manage sustainability data has raised $1.9 million (€1.8 million) in seed funding.

The round which is still open has been co-led by Ugly Duckling Ventures and Superangel.io with support from individual investors Sean Brown Sean Evans and Patrick Patrong.

“We have retained the possibility of adding another investor to this round and hope to find a partner that has experience with high-growth startups in the impact space particularly those with a background in B2B SaaS models travel and big data API to help accelerate our mission even further” said Frederik Steensgaard BeCause co-founder and CEO in a statement.

Booking Holdings a provider of online travel and related services that owns travel platform Booking.com is keeping the technology capital Bengaluru at the forefront for its innovations in the travel fintech space and plans to hire more tech talent in the city.

The company has launched a commercial centre of excellence (CoE) in the tech hub.

""We just crossed 350 people in the last couple of weeks out of which 175 talent is for fintech. Around 20 percent people of my organisation globally are from Bengaluru which a year ago was zero. So in terms of shifting where the talent is Bengaluru has arrived dramatically. The plan for the next few years for the overall centre is to get to 1000 more people"" Daniel Marovitz senior vice-president fintech Booking.com told Moneycontrol.

He said that Bengaluru puts 2x more engineers than Germany.

""While we have been hiring people from around the world for my fintech team the largest part of my Dutch team is India. There are more Indians working for Booking.com than Dutch people. That was also a reason to come here (Bengaluru) because we were already here without being here. We had a bigger Diwali celebration in Amsterdam than our new office in India. There is enormous talent growth in India. There is so much technology innovation in the country and most of it is happening in Bengaluru. So it is a great place for us to be in. We expect the centre in Bengaluru to be larger than other sites"" he said.

Marovitz noted that companies have been coming to India for outsourcing offshoring but that was not their desire. ""Our headquarters is in Amsterdam and the closest mega centre for technology for us is Bengaluru. The city is a more important product and engineering centre globally than San Francisco Silicon Valley.""

The company is focusing on fintech solutions for travellers. ""A few years back we created a fintech unit at Booking.com and added a new business in half a decade. So creating a fintech unit was a big deal. We saw this as a big opp for incremental commercial opp. This unit launched in Bengaluru is one of the first projects of building a big transformational program in financial management. This work is the biggest that we have today and this is for the whole group. This new centre of excellence is doing new work and this is the first time we are going to build software that will be used by the entire network"" the senior VP said.

He added that India is one of the fastest-growing travel markets in the world and also the fastest for Booking.com in Asia. ""More Indians travelling abroad is a massive change in the last decade. When travellers travel long haul they cross borders and they also have to use a different currency. So this is an opportunity. We are also partnering with buy now pay later providers in the country. Also in India there are so many payments solutions. In addition the platform is looking to add more languages after adding Hindi recently"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0aW5zaWRlci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9jdC1jb21wYW5pZXMtaHJjLWxnYnRxLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1lcXVhbGl0eS0xODUyNTcxMi5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These CT-based companies got high marks for support of LGBTQ+ employees,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.ctinsider.com/business/article/ct-companies-hrc-lgbtq-corporate-equality-18525712.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0aW5zaWRlci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvYXJ0aWNsZS9jdC1jb21wYW5pZXMtaHJjLWxnYnRxLWNvcnBvcmF0ZS1lcXVhbGl0eS0xODUyNTcxMi5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNtc3dpcmUuY29tL3RoZS13aXJlL2IyYy1lLWNvbW1lcmNlLW1hcmtldC1yZXBvcnQtMjAyNC1hLXZhbHVhdGlvbi1vZi11cy05MC10cmlsbGlvbi1wcmVkaWN0ZWQtYnktMjAzMi1pbWFyYy1ncm91cC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,B2C E-Commerce Market Report 2024: A Valuation of US$ 9.0 Trillion Predicted by 2032 | IMARC Group,"B2C E-commerce Market

10 underrated houseplants

Our expert pick of underrated houseplants are all easy to grow and undemanding types - criteria which are always top of our list when we're choosing houseplants.

They are unusual have interesting qualities and look good if you enjoy decorating with plants to brighten up your living space. Now to find out what's on our list.

1. Chinese evergreen

Botanical name: Aglaonema

Most underrated for: air-purifying

While we've all heard about the beneficial properties of plants like peace lilies that purify the air while we sleep and weeping fig plants that mop up toxins the Chinese evergreen plant might not be on your radar - yet.

'In my humble opinion this plant genus is highly underrated and isn’t raved about nearly enough' says Kamili Bell Hill creator of Plantblerd founder of Black People with Plants and author of Happy Plants Happy You! available from Amazon.

'They are spectacular. If it's variegation you seek this is the plant for you. You can find them with leaves of green and white pink and white red and green and different shades of green.'

These leafy lovelies are one of the most underrated air-purifying plants. There are a huge number of varieties to choose from in a range of lovely colors. They are a good choice for low light rooms and require little watering.

It's also one of the most durable houseplants you can grow tolerating low light dry air and drought. Look out for the variety Aglaonema 'Silver Bay'.

'It has striking green foliage and an easy-going nature' according to the plant experts at Bloomscape. 'The large leaves are detailed with an icy green center flowing into dark and light green striped edges retaining their color and pattern in even the lowest lighting conditions.'

Kamili Bell Hill Social Links Navigation Author and Planterior Designer Kamili Bell Hill combines her love of plants and design to curate a brand and community known as PlantBlerd where she partners beautiful houseplants with simple care information and words of encouragement. PlantBlerd serves as both a style and a growing guide. After noticing a lack of social media platforms highlighting houseplant collectors that look like her she established BlackPeople.WPlants featuring Black houseplant collectors from around the world. She put a career in law on hold to pursue her true passion of interior design and quickly realized the important role plants play in her clients’ designs.

2. Whale fin snake plant

(Image credit: Tharakorn Arunothai/Alamy Stock Photo)

Botanical name: Sansevieria masoniana (Dracaena masoniana)

Most underrated for: low light rooms

We're all familiar with the tall sword-shaped foliage of the regular snake plant but this variety is a little more unusual. Whale fin is a giant version that can grow up to 4-6 feet tall although admittedly it will take a long time to do so. It has attractive wide dark green leaves and the gorgeous coloring intensifies if you position your plant in a low light spot.

This is the plant to choose if you want something that will thrive in the shade of a hallway. Although it tolerates low light you will get faster growth if you place it in bright indirect light.

Like all snake plants this one is easy to propagate. You can simply cut leaf segments and root them in soil or grow them in water to expand your collection of these shapely specimens.

3. Crispy wave fern

Botanical name: Asplenium nidus

Most underrated: easy to grow fern

If you have struggled with your Boston fern turning brown or your asparagus fern turning yellow it could be time to switch your allegiance to one of the most underrated ferns around as Kamili Bell Hill has discovered.

'Just when I thought all was lost I stumbled upon the crispy wave a fern so different from all the others' she explains. 'Instead of small delicate leafy fronds it has these big paddle-like fronds that feel like lettuce and kind of look like a Boston fern leaflet.

'It was a love connection! This cultivar matched my energy and enthusiasm. And more importantly it matched my growing environment without a hitch. Unlike the others this fern was able to adapt to average household humidity. The crispy wave showed me the meaning of true fern love. And now here we are – I water she grows. It’s a beautiful thing.'

This hard-to-kill fern is a good choice if you have a chill plant parent style and a bad track records with other types of fern plant.

4. Stromanthe Triostar

Botanical name: Stromanthe Sanguinea 'Triostar'

Most underrated for: fantastic foliage

This stunning plant has variegated leaves in shades of pink green and white. A real beauty that will add a vibrant new color mix to your plant collection its star qualities are reflected in the name. We think you should be snapping one up now.

'Help its variegation stay vibrant by placing it in a spot that receives bright indirect light' says Eliza Blank founder of The Sill. 'The stromanthe is part of the same family as prayer plants and will similarly appreciate high humidity from a pebble tray or humidifier.'

The more indirect light the plant receives the more variegation you will see on the leaves. Too much bright light and this beauty will lose some of the color variation that catches the eye in the first place. Another plus is that the stromanthe has air purifying qualities too.

5. Avocado plant

(Image credit: Westend61 GmbH/Alamy Stock Photo)

Botanical name: Persea americana

Most underrated: free plant

Instead of throwing all those avocado stones away why not grow new houseplants from them? These leafy lovelies are one of the best kitchen plants as well as making an interesting display on a warm bright windowsill or in a humid conservatory. Given a combination of light humidity and regular watering avocado plants will thrive.

As the plants grow pinch out the tips regularly to create bushy well-shaped plants. Find out more about how to grow avocados if the idea appeals. There are several techniques including the toothpick method where you partially submerge the stone in water or alternatively submerge the whole stone in water. It can take a few weeks and up to several months to germinate but it's well worth the wait.

6. Variegated Swiss cheese plant

(Image credit: Firn/Alamy Stock Photo)

Botanical name: Monstera deliciosa variegata

Most underrated for: making a statement in your living room

The Swiss cheese plant is instantly recognisable and adds a stylish statement to any interior. But if you want to introduce a new type of Swiss cheese to mix up the look of your foliage try a variegated one.

'The variegated version of the popular Monstera plant has become something like the holy grail of the Plant Tribe' according to Igor Josifovic and Judith de Graaff authors of the bestselling books Urban Jungle: Living and Styling with Plants (available to order from Amazon) and Plant Tribe (also available from Amazon).

'This rare variety is hard to find and even when you do find it it tends to be pretty pricey. But if you’re lucky enough to come across one (or to receive a cutting from a plant friend) don’t think twice. Go for it and add this botanical gem to your living room.'

Place your variegated Swiss cheese in a warm spot that gets bright indirect light and keep it moister than you would its non-variegated cousin. If you're interested in growing your collection find out how to propagate a monstera by taking stem cuttings as they will root easily especially if they're already growing aerial roots.

7. Purple passion plant

(Image credit: Biosphoto/Alamy Stock Photo)

Botanical name: Gynura aurantiaca

Most underrated: colorful houseplant

The eye-popping violet foliage of the purple passion plant offers an unusual and attractive choice for brightly lit rooms. In fact the brighter light will intensify the purple color of this plant giving it a lovely shimmering iridescence.

The velvety leaves (the reason it is also known as the velvet plant) have a cascading habit that makes it ideal for indoor hanging baskets if you like a tropical jungle look. This is definitely one of the most underrated houseplants that deserves your attention if you want to introduce a vivid accent to your room.



Despite their exotic appearance these plants are fairly easy to care for making them an excellent choice for novice plant parents.

8. Shrimp plant

(Image credit: Magicflute002/Getty Images)

Botanical name: Justicia brandegeeana

Most underrated for: year-round flowers

The blooms of the attractive and easy-to-grow shrimp plant appear nearly all year round.

The arching flower sprays are salmon-pink colored and come from the plants plentiful bracts (modified leaves) which helps explain why the 'flowers' are so prolific.

This plant is easy to please and if it likes your growing conditions can reach up to 3 feet. All it requires are warm days cool nights and a sunny windowsill to call home. If your plant gets a little straggly snip it back by about a half to encourage new growth and it will quickly bush up again.

One of the best indoor flowering plants it's a good attention grabbing variety to choose if your plant collection is looking a little too uniformly green and you want an easy long-flowering indoor plant to add some color.

9. Wax plant

(Image credit: Helin Loik Tomson/Getty Images)

Botanical name: Hoya carnosa

Most underrated for: blooms

The very collectable trailing Hoya carnosa plant has exquisite clusters of waxy star-shaped cream flowers and dark green leaves on vigorous twining stems that can reach 15 foot or more. Easy to grow and take care of? Yes. Fast growing? Absolutely.

'Once you add any single plant from the Hoya genus you will be hooked' says Kamili Bell Hill. 'You will not be able to stop at one because they are just delightful. Of all the plant discoveries I have made this is probably my favorite. You’ll add them for their foliage and obsess over them because of their otherworldly blooms. This genus was completely unknown to me before I started collecting plants. Now I am obsessed.'

Kamili likens the fantastic blooms to delicate confectionery flowers crafted from marzipan or fondant frosting something you might find on a tiered wedding cake.

Hoya plants love a spot with bright indirect light in your bathroom or kitchen which tend to be more humid. Find out how to care for hoya plants and give them the right conditions then they will develop into a large vining statement plant in a relatively short period of time. They look good trailing down from shelves or in a hanging planter too.

10. Lipstick echeveria

Botanical name: Echeveria agavoides

Most underrated: succulent

If like us you're a big fan of succulents you'll always be on the lookout for unusual varieties to grow your collection. While super-appealing echeveria are probably already on your radar the stunning lipstick variety might be new to you.

The red-tinged leaf edges of this pretty plant develop best in sunlight so it's a great choice for sunny windowsills where it will grow up to 5 inches tall and will spread to 12 inches making it a pretty decent sized succulent. The more light you give them the more red coloration you will get too.

Also known as moulded wax or wax agave it's a joy to look after especially as you don't have to water it for half the year (from October to May). They're also easy to propagate as you can gently pull off any offsets or individual leaves and pot them up separately in gritty soil.

Every year over 44000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in England

A study led by the National Institute for Health and Care Research’s Imperial Biomedical Research Centre has revealed that minimally invasive focal therapies for prostate cancer are more cost-effective and improve patient outcomes.

Every year more than 52000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in the UK which occurs in the prostate gland.

Funded by Boston Scientific Corporation and published in the Journal of Medical Economics the study involved Boston Scientific Imperial College London (ICL) researchers and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust.

Focal therapies including cryotherapy and High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) work to freeze and heat specific areas of cancer in the prostate leaving normal tissue intact and avoiding damage to the surrounding nerves blood vessels and muscles.

Researchers analysed data from over 1300 patients treated at five hospitals between 2006 and 2018 to develop an economic model comparing the costs and outcomes following focal therapy prostatectomy surgery or radiotherapy for up to ten years after treatment.

They revealed that focal therapy using either cryotherapy or HIFU had a lower overall cost and a higher patient benefit in comparison to surgery or radiotherapy.

Focal therapy was associated with a lower risk of urinary sexual and bowel side effects compared to prostatectomy surgery or radiotherapy.

Furthermore focal therapy also improved patients’ quality-adjusted life years at a lower overall cost in comparison to radical prostatectomy or external beam radiotherapy.

Professor Hashim Ahmed chair of urology at ICL and consultant urological surgeon at ICL Healthcare NHS Trust said: “Focal therapy represents good value for money in the NHS… [with] lower side effects and improved quality of life compared to traditional treatments [and] could benefit about 10000 patients who are diagnosed with prostate cancer in the UK each year.”

Xavier Bertrand vice president of peripheral interventions Boston Scientific in EMEA said: “The research findings are great news for patients and… the healthcare system… [and] could help to resolve the current disparities in the UK for patients with prostate cancer.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3NkZXZpY2UuY29tL2ludmVzdG9ycy1vdmVycmVhY3RpbmctYXRyaWN1cmUtbWVkdHJvbmljLXBlbmRpdHVyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Are investors overreacting on AtriCure after Medtronic's Penditure launch?,"BTIG analysts say a small survey of surgeons may indicate an oversell of AtriCure stock following Medtronic’s launch of a competing device.

Medtronic this week launched the Penditure left atrial appendage (LAA) exclusion device adding another system to a competitive space. AtriCure Abbott and Boston Scientific all offer LAA devices while Johnson & Johnson MedTech just made its own play in the market.

AtriCure took the biggest hit as a result of the Medtronic launch with stock falling nearly 20%. The reaction comes as a result of AtriCure’s makeup with the AtriClip LAA device making up around a third of its revenue according to BTIG.

The Penditure and AtriClip are quite similar devices. Both are meant for accompanying use with another heart surgery procedure. The situation leads to question marks over how the former’s launch affects the latter.

BTIG analysts Marie Thibault and Sam Eiber noted that AtriCure’s management team said it welcomes competition. They also say the team expects it to help expand procedure volumes. Although they anticipate nearly all sites will try Penditure the AtriCure team doesn’t expect a significant transition away from the company’s own product.

The analysts collected responses from 21 cardiac surgeons who use AtriClip to gauge the potential impact of the Penditure launch. They note that the small number of respondents reflects a sample of the range of potential reactions not an exact indicator of market movement.

The analysts say that based on estimates they see a potential $48 million difference or 9% reduction in total 2025 sales for AtriClip. Thibault and Eiber maintain their “Buy” rating for AtriCure.

“Though some caution on the competitive landscape is warranted as the launch unfolds in our view [AtriCure] shares are oversold at this point” they wrote. “These survey results are extremely preliminary and we are not changing our ATRC forecast at this time.”

More on the survey

Surveyed doctors pointed out Penditure’s similarities to AtriClip with several responses reflecting favorably on the Medtronic product. Some called it “interesting” and a “good concept” according to BTIG. A couple of surgeons highlighted the ability to recapture reposition and redeploy the device too.

Nearly all (86%) said they intend to try Penditure like AtriCure expects. BTIG says it expects Penditure to capture 24% of the market share in 2024 and 27% in 2025. However in 2024 more than a third of respondents expect to move 5% or less of their volume to Penditure. Five doctors don’t expect to shift any volume and only two expect greater than 50% movement.

The analysts however saw some skepticism over how useful that feature could prove. They also say some doctors were unsure over what Penditure offers that they can’t already get with AtriClip.

BTIG’s analysts say they spoke to two AtriClip-using cardiothoracic surgeons who also have Penditure experience. Both saw similarities in the devices’ designs but again highlighted the “unique” recapturing repositioning and redeploying capabilities of Penditure. One said he “wishes he had the ability to reposition in as many as 5-10% of his AtriClip cases.”

AtriCure believes this is rare the analysts wrote and the company hasn’t heard doctor feedback asking for repositionability. The analysts still expect AtriClip to take the dominant share of concomitant LAA cases.

“AtriCure’s management team has been vocal in saying that this new device will not hurt the AtriClip business but that they instead expect new competition to help expand the market for left atrial appendage exclusion in patients undergoing concomitant cardiac surgery” the analysts wrote.

Why analysts remain optimistic on AtriCure

AtriCure told BTIG that it sees a competitive entry as “good validation” of the LAA therapy area and approach. Additionally instead of repositionability the company hears clinicians ask for a smaller-profile device.

With AtriClip in its seventh generation the company has plans to launch an eighth-generation device next year. It expects the smaller-profile Flex Mini to come in the second half of 2024. The company’s open ablation product also remains the only offering with FDA PMA labeling for treating AFib during concomitant cardiac surgery. Medtronic’s Cardioblate has 510(k) clearance.

Importantly the analysts say AtriCure management says the Penditure launch has no impact on its overall sales growth outlook.

The analysts said AtriCure has encouraged its salesforce to garner feedback on Penditure from clinicians. They also say pricing for Penditure appears consistent with AtriClip and one doctor claims he hasn’t seen discounting from Medtronic.

Altogether the analysts’ view on AtriCure remains an optimistic one.

“We believe there continues to be strong potential for upside in the core business from improved open surgery volumes as training and awareness grow ongoing momentum within the AtriClip franchise and contribution from new verticals like cryoablation” the analysts’ investment thesis on AtriCure says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lZGljYWxkZXZpY2UtbmV0d29yay5jb20vbmV3cy9qb2huc29uLWpvaG5zb24tbWVkdGVjaC1hY3F1aXJlcy1oZWFydC1pbXBsYW50LWNvbXBhbnktbGFtaW5hci1mb3ItNDAwbS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Johnson & Johnson MedTech acquires heart implant company Laminar for $400m,"Shares in J&J were up 1.6% at the market close on 30 November.

Johnson & Johnson (J&J) MedTech has made an upfront payment of $400m to acquire the privately held company Laminar a US-based developer of a heart implant that reduces the chance of stroke.

The completed deal which also includes additional potential clinical and regulatory milestone payments will see Laminar join J&J as part of its Biosense Webster division according to a 30 November press release.

Shares in J&J were up 1.7% at the market close on 30 November compared to the pre-announcement market close on 29 November. The company has a market cap of $372bn.

As a result of the deal J&J adjusted its profit projections due to necessary research and development. The company reduced operational and reported Adjusted EPS by approximately $0.17 and expects a $0.15 EPS hit in 2024.

Laminar’s device is being developed to eliminate the left atrial appendage (LAA) in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. The appendage is a small pouch in the left atrium that can be a source of clots which can enter the bloodstream and cause strokes.

Laminar says its implant unlike other commercial products such as those from Abbott and Boston Scientific uses rotational motion to eliminate the LAA. Abbott and Boston Scientific’s implants use occlusion to seal off the appendage from the bloodstream.

This week Medtronic launched its LAA device called Penditure in the US. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared clip acquired from Syntheon in August 2023 is designed to be used during concomitant cardiac surgery procedures.

A market model by GlobalData estimates the global clot management device market will be worth $1.3bn in 2024.

The FDA recently approved Laminar’s pivotal study which is expected to begin enrolment in early 2024.

J&J says around 38 million people globally live with atrial fibrillation. For those who cannot tolerate blood thinners on a long-term basis LAA closure is an important procedure for reducing thromboembolism risk.

Laminar CEO Randy Lashinski said: “For the millions of people living with atrial fibrillation stroke risk is a major concern. The team at Laminar is driven by our vision to develop and deliver an innovative solution to help patients live without the fear of stroke or the need for long-term use of blood thinners.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1LmVkdS9oaWMvMjAyMy8xMi8wMS9jaHVhbmZlaS1kb25nLWhhcmlyaS1hZmZpbGlhdGUtMjAyMy1ocGMtaW5ub3ZhdGlvbi1leGNlbGxlbmNlLWF3YXJkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chuanfei Dong Receives 2023 HPC Innovation Excellence Award | Rafik Hariri Institute for Computing and ...,"Chuanfei Dong Receives 2023 HPC Innovation Excellence Award

By Margo Stanton Hariri Institute for Computing

Hariri Institute Faculty Affiliate Chuanfei Dong received the 2023 HPC Innovation Excellence Award from Hyperion Research which recognizes achievements made in High Performance Computing (HPC) technologies for business and scientific applications.

Dong an assistant professor of astronomy and electrical and computer engineering at Boston University was recognized for performing the world’s largest turbulence simulation using 200 million hours of computer time to unmask the flow of energy in space and astrophysical plasmas. This work is described in the Sciences Advances paper titled “Reconnection-Driven Energy Cascade in Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence.”

In this project Dong conducted simulations that identified a novel energy transfer mechanism that challenges the widely accepted classical paradigm of the turbulent energy cascade. This discovery based on the breakup of elongated electric current sheets facilitates the transfer of energy from large to small scales through the steepening of the energy spectra.

Dong’s work contributes to the tackling of a range of space and astrophysical puzzles including one of the main goals of NASA’s Parker Solar Probe mission solar coronal heating. Furthermore it will help solve the questions behind star formation and predict eruptive space weather events that have the potential to disrupt cell phone service black out the Earth’s power grids and destroy satellites in orbit.

Some of Dong’s main research interests are in magnetic reconnection and turbulence physics-informed machine learning and high-intensity laser-plasma interactions. Dong was a recipient of the Department of Energy’s 2023 Early Career Research Award for his work on improving understanding of the flow of energy in plasma turbulence. This grant will help him expand on his research on “Reconnection-Driven Energy Cascade in Magnetohydrodynamic Turbulence.”

HPC Innovation Award recipients receive a $1000 honorarium award certificate and trophy recognizing their achievements. The award recognizes developments made in simulation artificial intelligence and other advanced analytics quantum computing and similar methods and technologies. It is internationally recognized as a touchstone for outstanding achievements in high-performance computing. Award winners range from government and academic research teams to global corporations.

Dong is involved in several significant research projects ranging from NASA’s MAVEN mission which studies how billions of years ago Mars lost a significant portion of its atmosphere the joint European and Japanese BepiColombo mission on Mercury and a study of the TRAPPIST-1 system the newly discovered Earth-sized planets that orbit a star 39 light-years away from Earth using James Webb Space Telescope.

Chuanfei Dong received his B.S. in Space Science from the University of Science and Technology in China his M.S. in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences from Georgia Tech an M.S. in Space Science M.S.E. in Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences and dual Ph.D. in Space Science and Scientific Computing from the University of Michigan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndidXIub3JnL25ld3MvMjAyMy8xMi8wMi93aW50ZXItc3Vuc2V0cy1zY2llbmNlLW5ldy1lbmdsYW5kLW5ld3NsZXR0ZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why winter sunsets are especially vibrant explained by a New England meteorologist,"Editor's Note: This is an excerpt from WBUR's Saturday morning newsletter The Weekender. If you like what you read and want it in your inbox sign up here.

Though it’s been hard to adjust to the past month of earlier nightfall I can’t say I’m disappointed with the beautiful sunsets that have graced the skies on these colder clear days — filled with rich rosy shades of red and pink swirling with the clouds to create a cosmic smoothie.

Summer sunsets can be lovely. But if you ask me the colors at play during an autumn or winter sunset are consistently better — and as it turns out there’s science to back up that opinion.

“Sunsets are more vibrant in winter months” local meteorologist and weather expert Danielle Noyes told me.

But why? I asked Noyes to help to explain this fascinating scientific phenomenon.

What determines the colors we see in the sky?

Let’s start with the basics. While all the colors of the rainbow exist in sunlight the color you see when you look up at the sky is determined by a physical process called “Rayleigh scattering.”

(NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory)

The process describes what happens to the waves of sunlight as they come toward us. As they travel through the atmosphere they’re met by molecules like nitrogen and oxygen and small particles that reflect the light’s rays causing them to scatter across the sky.

As Noyes explained “each color has its own wavelength.” That wavelength determines how far a color has to travel before our eyes recognize it. Blue and violet light in particular are reflected by the elements in our atmosphere which is why we see blue during the day.

But at sunset as we rotate away from the sun light has to travel farther — through more of the atmosphere — to reach our eyes.

“Essentially more atmosphere means more molecules to scatter violets and blues away from your eyes leaving other colors like yellow orange and red” Noyes said.

The recipe for a perfect winter sunset

So what makes the sunset especially vibrant in the winter? There are three main factors to consider: The weather our region here in New England and the positioning of the Earth.

“When it’s cooler out and less humid there’s less water vapor in the air” said Noyes. Fewer particles in the air results in less light being scattered. “In turn colors can look bolder” she added.

A storm rolling in can make for a beautiful sunset too. For example when a Nor’easter is coming cirrus clouds often arrive well in advance of the storm itself. “Made up of ice crystals these clouds certainly decorate the sky and allow for extra vivid sunset displays” Noyes said.

Additionally much of the cold winter air we feel in New England often travels down from Canada or the Arctic where the air is typically cleaner said Noyes. “Fresh clean air results in a crisper sunset.” (The perfect counterexample of course being the hazy red sunsets we experienced this past summer due to some not-so-clean Canadian air.)

“The Earth [also] spins closer to the sun in winter and the sun sets at a sharper angle making sunset colors last a bit longer than in summer months” said Noyes. That means a winter sunset lingers on the horizon giving us more time to enjoy it.

Still beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Some people may be partial to that hazy summer sunset over the vibrance of winter.

“I have found that there will always be ongoing debates on sunrise and sunset beauty” said Noyes. “It is after all very subjective.”

BMY,Bristol Myers Squibb,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vcGhhcm1hY2V1dGljYWwtam91cm5hbC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9mZWF0dXJlL21hcnlhbS1qZXRoYdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Maryam Jetha,"Maryam Jetha knew that working to improve medicines safety was her calling and when met with obstacles on her path towards that goal was not prepared to take no for an answer.

Jetha was first intrigued by the prospect of working in healthcare after spending a lot of time in hospital with her grandmother. She noted that the pharmacist was the link between the other members of the multidisciplinary team and she was fascinated by the drug chart at the end of the bed. “I wished I could understand it I wanted to be able to help” she says.

Then while she was at university Jetha’s interest in medicine safety was piqued by her work campaigning against fake drugs. She was student lead on University College London’s ‘Fight the Fakes’ committee. In 2018 Jetha helped organise a panel discussion bringing together experts from the World Health Organisation Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the Royal Academy of Science International Trust for 150 attendees from academia students non-governmental organisation (NGOs) regulatory bodies and pharma start-ups to discuss the global health threat of substandard and falsified medicines.

Patient safety feels like my purpose in whatever I do

The following year she helped organise and took part in a World Health Assembly side event on the topic of falsified and substandard medicines.

Working as a medical affairs final signatory who ensures that a pharmaceutical company is compliant with industry code of practice and that scientific communication is medically accurate was not an area Jetha had any exposure to while at university. It was not until she did a four-month internship at Bristol Myers Squibb in 2019 that she was aware of what the job entailed.

Following her internship Jetha went to Toronto for four months as an international graduate researcher looking at innovative ways of working in community pharmacy and the role of the pharmacy technician and how they are integrated into the team. When she came back she completed a hospital preregistration placement at Barts Health NHS Trust in 2020/2021. When a graduate scheme in medical affairs back at Bristol Myers Squibb opened she jumped at the chance.

Despite being new to medical signatory training at this stage in her career let alone be certified she persisted. “I was just drawn to it patient safety feels like my purpose in whatever I do.”

That determination paid off and her team saw that her ideas could make a difference so they gave her more responsibility.

Once certified in 2022 she was able to guide teams to ensure they were acting with integrity ethics and compliance in their daily roles and was increasingly aware of the challenges that new starters and signatories face when practically applying their knowledge of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry code of practice. In response she created innovative code training resources including podcasts and fortnightly ‘code clubs’ to not only upskill herself but also share with all employees. It has proven incredibly popular and is now in its second year with people volunteering to present an industry code case and highlighting how it impacts healthcare professionals and patients.

“It is an open forum to bring everyone in the office together and we talk through a particular [industry code] case” she explains. “I also wanted to highlight that compliance was a collective responsibility for all employees.” Jetha no longer manages the logistics of code clubs but its legacy continues.

Her current role as a medical signatory has absolutely lived up to her expectations and she is just as passionate about compliance as she was when she asked to do the training. “I want to continue to ensure patients are safe. It is not about saying you can’t do this but finding ways to do something so we can make it better for healthcare professionals and ultimately patients.”

“Maryam is a role model for other Muslim women of colour trailblazing a path for others in the pharmaceutical industry. Maryam has led on greater collaboration working with pharmacy technicians recognising the value and contribution of the whole pharmacy team.” “An innovative approach to falsified medicines. Maryam has started impacting the world of medicines at a very early stage of her career.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWJpb3RlY2guY29tL2Jpb3RlY2gvdGFuZy1jYXBpdGFscy1jb25jZW50cmEtYmFjay1hbm90aGVyLWJ1eW91dC1vZmZlci10aW1lLWxpYW5iaW_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tang Capital's Concentra back with another buyout offer this time for LianBio,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/tang-capitals-concentra-back-another-buyout-offer-time-lianbio on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZWJpb3RlY2guY29tL2Jpb3RlY2gvdGFuZy1jYXBpdGFscy1jb25jZW50cmEtYmFjay1hbm90aGVyLWJ1eW91dC1vZmZlci10aW1lLWxpYW5iaW_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikwFodHRwczovL2xlZ2FsZGVzaXJlLmNvbS9yb3Blcy1ncmF5LWFkdmlzZXMtYXZpZGl0eS1iaW9zY2llbmNlcy1pbi1leHBhbmRlZC1jYXJkaW92YXNjdWxhci1nbG9iYWwtbGljZW5zaW5nLWNvbGxhYm9yYXRpb24td2l0aC1icmlzdG9sLW15ZXJzLXNxdWliYi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ropes & Gray Advises Avidity Biosciences in Expanded Cardiovascular Global Licensing Collaboration with Bristol ...,"Ropes & Gray represented Avidity Biosciences in a global licensing and research collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb focused on the discovery development and commercialization of RNA therapeutics directed to multiple cardiovascular targets with potential cumulative payments up to $2.3 billion.

Those new cancers could result in “serious outcomes including hospitalization and death” the FDA stated while adding that “the overall benefits of these products [CAR-T therapies] continue to outweigh their potential risks for their approved uses.”

At issue are cases of T-cell malignancies including CAR-positive lymphoma in patients who received treatment with BCMA- or CD19-directed autologous CAR-T immunotherapies.

The FDA said it had received 19 reports of new blood cancers in patients receiving CAR-T treatments for various cancers in the six years since the first two such therapies were approved—Kymriah® (tisagenlecleucel) marketed by Novartis (NVS) and approved in August 2017; and Yescarta® (axicabtagene ciloleucel) approved four months later and marketed by the Kite Pharma subsidiary of Gilead Sciences (GILD).

Of the 19 reports cited by the agency 12 were cases of T-cell lymphoma reported by patients using the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS). Other cases came to the FDA’s attention through clinical trials.

The news was enough to send shares falling on Tuesday morning for some CAR-T drug developers—notably those with such treatments in their pipelines or smaller biotechs. Among pipeline companies Autolus Therapeutics (AUTL) shares took the biggest tumble nosediving 35% from Monday’s close of $4.78 to $3.11 at 12 p.m. before finishing the day at $4.55 only a 5% single day drop. But shares skidded another 10% Wednesday to $4.08 before partially rising 5% to $4.27 Thursday as of 11:35 a.m.

Faring better was Arcellx (ACLX) whose shares slid 8% from its Monday close of $53.21 to $49.01 at 12 p.m. before finishing Tuesday down 4% at $51.10. Arcellx lost another 1% Wednesday before upticking 3% to $52.20 as of 11:35 a.m.

Among approved CAR-T therapy developers Legend fell 7% from Monday’s close of $61.56 to $57.42 as of 12:30 p.m. before rising again to $59.99 a 3% one-day decline.

Giants hardly budge

Significantly J&J and other biopharma giants with approved CAR-T treatments hardly budged:

BMS declined just 0.3% from $49.02 at Monday’s close to $48.85 at 3:30 p.m. finishing the day 1% higher at $48.92.

from $49.02 at Monday’s close to $48.85 at 3:30 p.m. finishing the day at $48.92. Gilead dipped 0.8% from $74.92 Monday to $74.30 at 1:30 p.m. before inching up 0.2% to finish at $74.51.

from $74.92 Monday to $74.30 at 1:30 p.m. before to finish at $74.51. J&J also slid 0.3% from $151.28 to $150.88 at the start of trading Tuesday then rallied to end the day up 0.5% at $151.63.

from $151.28 to $150.88 at the start of trading Tuesday then rallied to end the day at $151.63. Novartis fell 1% from $97.74 to $96.67 at the start of Tuesday trading but finished up 0.3% to an even $97.

All five makers of approved CAR-T therapies didn’t budge much Wednesday closing anywhere from down 1% (Arcellx) to up 1% (Gilead).

Kymriah and Yescarta are two of six CAR-T cancer immunotherapies approved by the FDA. The other four are Abecma® (idecabtagene vicleucel) marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS; stock ticker BMY); Breyanzi® (lisocabtagene maraleucel) also marketed by BMS; Carvykti™ (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) marketed by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)’s Janssen Biotech and Legend Biotech (LEGN); and Tecartus® (brexucabtagene autoleucel) marketed by Gilead.

$2.766 billion and growing

Revenues for the approved CAR-T treatments reached a combined $2.766 billion in the first nine months of this year with most of them therapies growing significantly year-over-year.

During January-September 2023 Gilead generated the most in CAR-T sales reporting $1.13 billion for its blockbuster Yescarta (up 37% from $823 million a year earlier) and another $272 million for Tecartus (up 25% from $217 million).

Next highest was BMS with $372 million for Abecma (up 41% from $263 million) and $263 million for Breyanzi (up 107% from $127 million) then Novartis with $388 million from Kymriah (down 2% from $397 million). Following closely is J&J’s $341 million from Carvykti (more than quadruple zooming 332% from $79 million—not counting Legend’s $152 million in Q3 net trade sales plus a $131.2 million increase in collaboration revenue due to increased revenue from Carvykti sales).

Baird senior research analysts Brian P. Skorney and Jack K. Allen and colleagues said they expected only a limited impact on the commercial use of CAR-T therapies in later lines of treatment given the desperation of patients and physicians in severe refractory B-cell malignancies as well as the FDA’s affirmation of a favorable risk/benefit profile.

But the growth strategies for CAR-T therapies generally involve label expansion into earlier lines of treatment according to Skorney and Allen—such as Yescarta’s effort to add an indication for second-line diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

“T-cell malignancies tend to be rapidly progressing cancers with few treatment options. Thus we believe this update may impact the therapeutic index calculation for regulators and prescribers when it comes to earlier lines of treatment and less aggressive forms of B-cell malignancies (e.g. CLL follicular lymphoma)” Skorney and Allen observed. “While this dynamic could limit the commercial potential of CAR-T products in earlier line indications given the substantial number of unknowns here it is difficult to quantify the potential effect.”

“Substantial hurdle” for autoimmunity

They added that the potential for T-cell malignancy a rare but highly fatal side effect “is likely to present a substantial hurdle for expansion into autoimmune indications where the expected tolerance for safety events is expected to be substantially diminished relative to oncology indications.”

That explains according to the analysts why immunology CAR-T cell therapy developer Cabaletta Bio (CABA) plummeted 27% on Tuesday from $18.70 to $13.69. Since then Cabaletta has risen 17% to $13.88 on Wednesday and $16.05 on Thursday.

“Development focus may shift to increase attention on T-cell malignancy rates” Skorney and Allen forecasted. “As a product of this investigation and any subsequent regulatory action we expect that biotechs focused on the cell therapy space are going to heighten their focus on T-cell-related adverse events going forward. Although the mechanism behind the induced malignancies appears to be uncertain currently we expect this side effect may become a larger focus for biotechs with commercialized cell therapies and those currently in the development stage.”

Of the 19 cases that sparked the FDA investigation 12 were T-cell related malignancies. That number contrasts with the 46 total CAR-T related cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 60 of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) reported to FAERS John Newman PhD an analyst with Canaccord Genuity wrote Wednesday in one research note.

“Ultimately we expect FDA to conclude that the risk of CAR-T cells becoming or causing T-cell cancers is low and manageable but we await the conclusion of FDA’s investigation” Newman predicted in a second note to investors. “We suspect FDA will better quantify the risk of serious outcomes after T-cell cancers following CAR-T therapy and then update product labels accordingly.

He cited the fact all CAR-T therapies already have a class warning in place for the potential of developing secondary malignancies.

“Importantly if FDA has serious concerns they could have halted ongoing CAR-T trials and/or halted treatment of patients with approved CAR-Ts” Newman added. “The fact that they did neither suggests overall risk is manageable in our view.

More than half of the 12 T-cell malignancy cases (seven) were from patients treated with Kymriah. Another three were treated with Yescarta and one each with Breyanzi and Carvykti. No cases arose from Abecma and Tecartus patients.

“Patients and clinical trial participants receiving treatment with these products should be monitored life-long for new malignancies” the FDA advised.

However Newman cautioned: “Importantly we do not know the total number of Carvykti and Abecma patients treated. We also do not have T-cell malignancy data on any CAR-T products still in clinical studies.”

And it looks like Broadcom's first big move is going to be layoffs: according to WARN notices filed with multiple states (catalogued here by Channel Futures) Broadcom will be laying off at least 2837 employees across multiple states including 1267 at its Palo Alto campus in California.

As Channel Futures notes the actual number of layoffs could be higher since not all layoffs require WARN notices. We've contacted Broadcom for more information about the total number of layoffs and the kinds of positions that are being affected and will update if we receive a response. VMware has around 38300 employees worldwide.

The WARN notices list the reason for the layoffs as ""economic"" but provide no further explanation or justification.

Broadcom still makes most of its money from its wired and wireless communication products and other chips; 78 percent of the roughly $8.9 billion that Broadcom made in Q3 of 2023 was from its ""semiconductor solutions"" segment. But Broadcom has been trying to buy its way into enterprise software for years now including an $18.9 billion acquisition of CA Technologies in 2018 and a $10.7 billion acquisition of Symantec in 2019.

Despite the layoffs VMware will remain central to Broadcom's enterprise software strategy. The company's Broadcom Software Group will be renamed VMware and the company is reportedly planning to emphasize software subscriptions rather than one-time sales to boost revenue. Aside from that we don't know many details about what a Broadcom-owned VMware will ultimately look like. The only VMware product mentioned at any length in Broadcom CEO Hock Tan's post about the acquisition is VMware Cloud Foundation.

Semiconductor company Broadcom is planning to lay off approximately 1267 VMware staff in California after acquiring the latter for $61bn reported Bloomberg.

In a submission to the California Employment Development Department Broadcom said the job cuts will start from 26 January 2024.

The affected positions are located at the Palo Alto headquarters of VMware.

Following the job cuts the headquarter will remain operational.

The move is in line with the chipmaker’s practice of cutting jobs following acquisitions to reduce expenses.

Through a series of acquisitions that have concentrated on software Broadcom CEO Hock Tan has established one of the largest firms in the semiconductor industry.

Tan’s approach is to find businesses with a substantial market share but limited room for expansion.

After buying them he combines sales HR and other support departments in an effort to save expenses while retaining engineering expertise.

Broadcom completed VMware’s acquisition late in November 2023 following approval from China which was last major hurdle in the way of the multi-billion-dollar merger.

The deal was first announced in May 2022.

Now Tan’s software efforts are focused on California-headquartered VMware which employed roughly 38300 people before the deal closed.

As part of the merger Broadcom Software Group will be rebranded and operate as VMware and combine its infrastructure and security software offerings into a broader VMware portfolio.

In addition Broadcom said that it will invest in VMware Cloud Foundation the software stack that underpins private and hybrid clouds.

Previously Broadcom CEO acquired the corporate security units of Symantec and CA Technologies to grow Broadcom’s software division.

Last month reports emerged that Amazon will let go “several hundred employees” working in its Alexa division.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8wMi9icm9hZGNvbS1jZW8tb3JkZXJzLWVtcGxveWVlcy1nZXQtYnV0dC1iYWNrLW9mZmljZS12bXdhcmUtcmVtb3RlLXdvcmsv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Broadcom CEO tells VMWare workers to 'get butt back to office' after completing a $69 billion merger of the two ...,"Chip manufacturer Broadcom wrote the latest chapter in the long story of return-to-office tensions between bosses and employees.

After completing its $69 billion acquisition of cloud-computing company VMWare Broadcom CEO Hock Tan issued a direct order to his new employees about where they must work. “If you live within 50 miles of an office you get your butt in here” he told the workers of previously remote-friendly VMWare.

The comments came during a meeting Tan hosted on Tuesday after the merger between the two companies officially closed following approval from Chinese regulators. Like many other executives Tan cited in-person work’s benefits to collaboration and company culture. “Collaboration is important and a key part of sustaining a culture with your peers with your colleagues” he said.

There was no word on what employees thought of the mandate specifically but there had been reports of broader concerns regarding the merger with Broadcom according to Business Insider. Broadcom has a history of chafing at remote work even during the pandemic going as far as ordering some employees back to the office as early as April 2020 in defiance of California’s statewide stay-at-home orders.

In recent months a growing amount of research has pointed to the benefits of in-person work especially when it comes to on-the-job training and career advancement. On the other hand proponents of remote work say it can help close gaps in promotion rates for women for example. And workers seem to prefer at least partial remote-work flexibility to the point that some would even be willing to take a 20% pay cut in order to keep the perk. However in contrast to Broadcom some companies such as Atlassian Dropbox and Airbnb have remained committed to remote work.

Broadcom isn’t alone in its back-to-the-office mandate. Insurance company Farmers Group faced an outcry from employees when new CEO Raul Vargas reversed his predecessor’s remote-work policy. In February Amazon changed its pandemic-era remote-work policy to require employees to be in the office at least three days a week. The e-commerce giant went as far as asking managers to consider office attendance alongside other factors like job performance when evaluating whether someone should get a promotion.

Many other CEOs have opted for the carrot instead of the stick when trying to curb remote work. In KPMG’s annual CEO survey 90% of respondents said they’d reward employees who make an effort to come into the office with “favorable assignments raises or promotions.” Others have tried to spin it as a necessary sacrifice for the greater good of the company. “You might be able to execute your work on time and to standard in a remote environment but what about your colleagues?” wrote Jake Wood CEO of software company Groundswell on LinkedIn this summer. “Absent your presence leadership mentorship—can they thrive?”

At Broadcom Tan permitted remote work only in very limited cases such as employees in the sales department who had to meet with clients regularly. Those who didn’t meet Tan’s requirements would need to clear an extraordinarily high bar. “Any other exception you better learn how to walk on water if you want to work remote” he told employees. “I’m serious.”

Throughout the meeting Tan and VMWare employees discussed how the two corporate cultures would mesh now that they were part of the same company. Return to office though wasn’t the only point of contention between VMWare and its new parent. When a VMWare employee asked if Broadcom would support employee resource groups (ERGs) Tan again offered a skeptical answer. “What is that? I’m just kidding. You want me to be direct? That’s an alien concept to me” he said.

While Tan admitted ERGs which provide support for groups of underrepresented employees weren’t part of Broadcom’s culture he said he was open to them. Broadcom did not respond to a request for comment from Fortune about whether it would allow VMWare employees to continue their existing ERGs.

Adding to the difficulties in integrating the two companies were the looming layoffs that are often a harsh reality of corporate mergers. Broadcom laid off approximately 1300 VMWare employees after the deal was completed while VMWare president Sumit Dhawan left to become the CEO of cybersecurity firm Proofpoint.

Many of Broadcom’s employees will move into VMWare’s Palo Alto headquarters which ironically had been largely empty thanks to its long-standing remote-work policy according to the San Francisco Standard.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdWJ1c2luZXNzbGluZS5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL2Jyb2FkY29tLXRvLWN1dC1hbG1vc3QtMTMwMC12bXdhcmUtam9icy1pbi1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLWFmdGVyLXRha2VvdmVyL2FydGljbGU2NzU5MzM5OC5lY2XSAYwBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGluZHVidXNpbmVzc2xpbmUuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9icm9hZGNvbS10by1jdXQtYWxtb3N0LTEzMDAtdm13YXJlLWpvYnMtaW4tY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1hZnRlci10YWtlb3Zlci9hcnRpY2xlNjc1OTMzOTguZWNlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Broadcom to cut almost 1300 VMware jobs in California after takeover,"Broadcom Inc. plans to fire almost 1300 VMware Inc. employees in California following the completion of a $61 billion acquisition that pushed the chipmaker deeper into the software industry.

The cuts will begin Jan. 26 and affect some 1267 positions Broadcom said in a submission to the California Employment Development Department. The jobs are located at VMware’s Palo Alto headquarters which will remain open.

The chipmaker is following its usual pattern of eliminating support roles to cut costs in the wake of takeovers. Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan has built one of the biggest companies in the semiconductor industry through a string of deals which have increasingly focused on software.

Tan’s strategy which has boosted profits and won him support from investors is to identify companies that have strong market share but stunted growth prospects. After purchasing them he consolidates operations — such as sales human resources and other support organizations — to cut costs while trying to retain engineering talent.

VMware has become the centerpiece of Tan’s software operations. He previously built up the division by purchasing CA Technologies and Symantec Corp.’s corporate security business.

VMware founded in 1998 pioneered virtualization programs which allow software to make more efficient use of server computers. The company had about 38300 employees prior to the closing of the transaction according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Broadcom whose other operations include making chips used by companies including Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google will report earnings next week.

The San Francisco Chronicle previously reported that Broadcom would cut more than 1200 workers.

And with Shanahan who is exacting when it comes to receiver play there were a lot of details.

“He went through all the things he looks for from the start of the route to the intangibles throughout the entire play and the way they finish” Ahmad said. “So as part of that exercise he definitely coached up movement skills: lower-body looseness how they moved their shoulders — all the things that (a scout) needs to go through. I was an area scout at the time. And that drill told me that when I’m on the road I’m going to be looking for this this and this.”

Suffice to say Pearsall has the qualities Shanahan described seven years ago especially the movement skills.”

“Williams joined the 49ers in 2011 as an assistant in the organization’s scouting department. He spent three years (2013-15) as a pro personnel scout. Williams worked the past two seasons as a national scout after five years as an area scout.

Williams attended St. Ignatius College Preparatory in San Francisco before attending Columbia University where he played wide receiver for four years. He earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Columbia in 2010.

He joined the 49ers after first working in the financial industry out of college.”

“While Lenoir a former fifth-round pick became a starter in 2022 his true breakout came in 2023 in his third season” wrote Buday. “After recording a 60.9 PFF overall grade in 2022 Lenoir improved to 75.8 in 2023 which ranked 23rd at the position. He also lowered his passer rating allowed number from 89.0 in 2022 to 75.7 this past season.”

“Renardo Green was the star of 49ers rookie minicamp.

He never got targeted and when he faced first-round pick Ricky Pearsall Green blanketed him particularly when playing press man-to-man coverage. Green clearly is a press-man specialist which is a value skill for a cornerback. But in OTAs Green will need to show that he can do more than play press.”

“Brown registered 32 tackles including six for a loss four sacks a pass defensed and a forced fumble through 13 games during his last collegiate season in 2022.”

An Arsenal of Weapons: The 49ers Have Quietly Become Even More Dangerous on Offense in 2024

By Don Atkinson 13 hrs

It's not a shock to anyone who looks back at the past two NFL seasons to contemplate that the San Francisco 49ers' offense has finally stepped out of the shadow cast by the team's ever-imposing defense. Since their 2019 Super Bowl run players like Nick Bosa Fred Warner Dre Greenlaw and former 49ers Richard Sherman and Jimmie Ward have garnered most of the attention when talking about the team. That was indeed the case until 2022 when future Hall-of-Fame running back Christian McCaffrey who came to San Francisco in a mid-season trade with the Carolina Panthers changed the conversation. The 49ers' offense was suddenly seen not just as a semi-capable complement to a sterling defense but rather as a unit that could put up some points and in a dramatic way. With the"

While the best companies are hard to find but they can generate massive returns over long periods. For example the Builders FirstSource Inc. ( ) share price is up a whopping 973% in the last half decade a handsome return for long term holders. This just goes to show the value creation that some businesses can achieve. And in the last month the share price has gained 24%. We love happy stories like this one. The company should be really proud of that performance!

With that in mind it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance or if there are some discrepancies.

To quote Buffett 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.

During five years of share price growth Builders FirstSource achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 68% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 61% per year. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. In fact the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.

You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).

We're pleased to report that the CEO is remunerated more modestly than most CEOs at similarly capitalized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Builders FirstSource's .

A Different Perspective

It's nice to see that Builders FirstSource shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 110% over the last year. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 61% per year) it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario this may hint at some real business momentum implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Builders FirstSource better we need to consider many other factors. For example we've discovered (1 is potentially serious!) that you should be aware of before investing here.

(Updated at 11:45 a.m.) After more than 200 years in business Alexandria’s Smoot Lumber yard is shutting down today.

The Alexandria-area supplier of mouldings doors and windows has been a staple for local builders since it was founded in 1822 and now its owner Builders FirstSource says that customers should visit its lumber yards in Manassas Manassas Park Springfield and in Waldorf Maryland.

Builders FirstSource is at a “juncture of change” Market Manager James Barbes wrote in a Nov. 29 letter to customers. Barbes did not say what the future holds for the sprawling property at 6295-20 Edsall Road.

“After thorough consideration we are announcing the integration of our Smoot Lumber location with our other local Builders FirstSource and TW Perry locations. This strategic consolidation allows us to streamline operations while continuing to provide you with the exceptional service and premium Smoot moulding profiles you’ve come to rely on.”

Barbes continued “Our commitment to Alexandria’s rich heritage remains unwavering and we are pleased to assure you that a line of historical Smoot moulding profiles will continue to be available.”

Barbes also said “the experienced and dedicated team members from Smoot Lumber will seamlessly transition to new roles within the market ensuring that your interactions with us remain as dependable and customer-focused as ever.”

The transition isn’t seamless for all employees. Ed King has worked at the lumber yard for 27 years 14 as a manager. He was told on Wednesday that his last day would be on Dec. 30 after he helps with the transition.

“I ain’t missed a day in 27 years” King said. “I know every stick of wood in this joint.”

King said he was offered a severance package and will take the next six months off.

“I’m going to take a vacation and then decide what’s next after that” King said. “I deserve a little break but I’m sad to see it go. This has been my home away from home.”

Mike Dameron owner of Alexandria-based Windmill Hill Home Design Build said it’s a big loss for local builders.

“In one way or another Smoot Lumber has been an integral part of the local and regional construction supply community for longer than any of us have been in business” Dameron said. “It will be a major loss to see them leave the city.”

To express these concerns they'll often turn to ESG funds that package lots of stocks together under one ticker symbol. That's a good idea because it spreads out company-specific risks.



But a downside to funds is that they generally won't perform as well as a single stock that's having a good run. That's because all the other stocks in the fund probably aren't performing exactly as well at the same time.

So some investors want to pick individual stocks that are involved in decarbonizing the economy social issues important to the investor or transparent and inclusive corporate governance.

""ESG investing has gained significant traction in recent years as investors increasingly prioritize sustainability and ethical considerations"" says Mike Darkowski founder of stock-picking tool Scrab. ""Governments and financial institutions around the world are increasingly recognizing the importance of sustainability and regulatory changes could impact the ESG landscape.""

If ESG investing interests you consider these seven ESG stocks several of which have turned in an impressive year-to-date performance:



ESG stock YTD return as of Nov. 30 Cadence Design Systems Inc. (ticker: CDNS) 70.1% Panasonic Holdings Corp. (OTC: PCRFY) 23.1% Tesla Inc. (TSLA) 94.9% Intel Corp. (INTC) 73.1% First Solar Inc. (FSLR) 5.3% Sunrun Inc. (RUN) -46.3% Orsted A/S (OTC: DNNGY) -46.9%

Cadence Design Systems Inc. (CDNS)

This company provides software hardware and intellectual property used to design electronic systems.

""Cadence has been at the forefront of providing innovative solutions for designing and verifying electronic systems and integrated circuits"" says Darkowski.

""When it comes to ESG the company takes great care of the 'social' part of the acronym"" he says. ""They proudly report a global gender pay equity achievement; they also don't forget about caring for the environment.""

He also notes that the company's recent financial results were ""more than good.""

In the third quarter the company reported net income of $254.3 million up more than 36% from the same period a year ago on sales of more than a billion dollars. Trends including artificial intelligence and autonomous driving are fueling electronic design activities and demand for the company's products.

Panasonic Holdings Corp. (OTC: PCRFY)

This Japanese multinational electronics company is focused on its automotive battery business. It's also involved in green hydrogen which unlike the majority of hydrogen produced today is made with renewably produced electricity instead of fossil fuels. Panasonic's fuel cell generators offer the promise of powering small-scale commercial facilities and can be scaled up by connecting multiple units.

The company also has an energy-management system that can control a decentralized power operation that combines hydrogen fuel cells with solar panels and lithium-based battery storage.

Companies involved in electric vehicle batteries have taken a hit amid concerns about EV demand at top automakers including Ford Motor Co. (F). Still even though there have been hiccups electric vehicles are expected to continue gaining ground.

""There are a lot of battery companies that have been beaten down"" says Christopher Day founder and CEO of Days Global Advisors. ""I think there's going to be a surprise there as far as demand for batteries.""

Although Panasonic's stock took a big dip in October it has been recovering and is now up 23.1% year to date as of Nov. 30.



Tesla Inc. (TSLA)

Speaking of electric vehicles this company is the world's biggest EV manufacturer based on its market capitalization of about $758 billion.

During the third quarter the company produced more than 430000 electric vehicles and delivered more than 435000.

Its revenue grew by 9% on increased vehicle deliveries and growth in other parts of the business. But its net income dropped 44% in part because of increased operating expenses connected with its Cybertruck and artificial intelligence projects and lower average selling prices.

""I think Tesla is a very interesting company"" Day says. The firm is a car company tech company and intellectual property-driven company rolled into one and that can lead to questions about how to value it he says.

""It's kind of its own animal"" he says. ""It's just going to be a very volatile ride.""

Intel Corp. (INTC)

This semiconductor company scores highly on governance and overall ESG metrics in the 2023 JUST Capital ESG rankings.

The report lists Intel as No. 19 when it comes to shareholders and governance a category the research nonprofit says includes ""acting ethically and with integrity at the leadership level prioritizing value creation for all stakeholders and generating returns for investors.""

Meanwhile Intel comes in at No. 9 overall in JUST Capital's rankings this year. Intel powers its operations with 80% renewable energy as part of its goal to reach 100% by 2030 JUST Capital says.

The company also ""commits to an independent and diverse board governed by 90% independent directors and led by an independent board chair"" the nonprofit says. ""Intel discloses intersectional board diversity and has 30% gender diversity and 30% racial/ethnic diversity on its board.""

First Solar Inc. (FSLR)

These last three stocks may fall into the category of bargains for buy-and-hold investors as renewable energy companies have been in a slump but may have a bright future.

Solar and wind companies have been hit by inflation which increases the costs of the materials they have to buy to build electric-generating farms which can be quite large. Inflation also triggered rising interest rates which make it more expensive for these companies to borrow money for the upfront costs of building solar and wind farms.

Amid these issues First Solar's shares are down 8.5% over the past 12 months but they have begun to rebound.

In addition to being a renewable energy company First Solar's ESG chops include that it uses cadmium telluride technology for its solar cells in a process that has a smaller carbon footprint than that of other manufacturers who use polysilicon. Additionally First Solar isn't reliant on Xinjiang a polysilicon-producing region in China where the U.S. says Muslim minorities are forced to work against their will.

Sunrun Inc. (RUN)

This photovoltaic solar and battery storage company hasn't fared as well as First Solar providing a much deeper discount for those who want to invest in the solar sector. Its shares are down about 46% year to date as of Nov. 30.

But the clouds may part for the stock. According to Stock Analysis the average 12-month price forecast from 22 stock analysts for Sunrun is $24.95 or roughly double where shares are trading now.

During the third quarter the company added nearly 34000 customers a 19% increase year on year.

Also Sunrun is shifting its focus to installing more storage systems which have better margins than solar panels. It expects installed storage capacity to more than double year over year in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile its installed solar energy capacity for the year is expected to grow 2% to 5% on an annual basis which is lower than its prior guidance of 10% to 15% growth.

Orsted A/S (OTC: DNNGY)

This company which is the largest offshore wind developer in the world has certainly been facing headwinds. Its shares are down 46.9% so far in 2023.

In addition to having trouble with inflation and rising interest rates Orsted has been hit by supply chain disruptions especially in the U.S. where the offshore wind industry isn't anywhere near as developed as those in Asia and Europe.

The company has had to cancel plans for two U.S. offshore wind projects as tax credit and construction permit issues also hampered the plans. But it is continuing with a third.

In the long run the U.S. is relying on offshore wind farms to help power coastal cities and Orsted is well positioned if industry dynamics change. The company was involved in developing two small pilot offshore wind projects in the U.S.

""Following several project cancellations governments should be more accommodative of offshore wind because it's absolutely necessary in order to achieve net-zero emissions"" says Michael Cerasoli portfolio manager of energy infrastructure strategies at Eagle Global Advisors.",,,,,,,,,

And it’s a working piece where guests see the fish being cooked that night.

Start with a drink! The Amalfi spritz with Selim spumante Cappelletti aperitivo and soda makes for a light sip while the mezcal Negroni with Del Maguey mezcal Cocchi Dopo Teatro amaro and Cappelletti apertivo deepen the cocktail experience.

Carry on with antipasti where a shellfish fritto misto with shrimp squid and delicata squash is accented by a tomato aioli. It’s those small touches that really impress—the burrata and red pepper shine with the addition of Calabrian chili and hazelnut pesto. Charred lemon leaves lend a wonderful flavor to bufula mozzarella. Flat-iron crusted prawns salmon carpaccio tuna tartare and blue crab and eggplant meatballs in fra diavolo sauce are unusual dishes you’ll be glad you sampled.

And eggplant al forno can’t go wrong at an Italian restaurant. There’s plenty of pasta available in some wildly differing forms from butternut squash goat cheese agnolotti with brown butter and the lobster cavatelli also served with a frame diabolo sauce. Orecchiette (“little ears”) is served with a delicious eggplant Bolognese.

The star of the show is the fish being displayed on ice in the huge bright-blue tiled basins. Choose one and get it roasted whole accented by Meyer lemon and capers red pepper and Calabrian chili pesto or salsa verde. You can also get a fillet with the same choices. But you aren’t limited to fish. Chicken Parmigiano and several steak options like ribeye and filet mignon in various sizes are sure to satisfy larger appetites.

Desserts are delicious with the triple lemon cake among the best. But Bobby’s pistachio sundae is sure to garner plenty of fans with pistachio gelato covered in dark chocolate sauce vanilla crema Amarena cherries and pistachio crunch—certainly worth saving room for!

The Camden resident was one of the first Black women to work at our company.

In celebration of her 100th birthday we recently welcomed Daisy or as her neighbors call her “the Queen” back to our Camden headquarters to tour the office and company archives and sit down with Mick Beekhuizen President Meals & Beverages.

Daisy Lee and Mick Beekhuizen President Meals & Beverages.

Below is a glimpse into their conversation.

Mick: Daisy welcome back! Should we call you “the Queen”?

Daisy: That’s what they call me!

Mick: When did you join the company?

Daisy: I’m originally from Georgia and moved to Camden in July of 1942. When I moved here I started looking for a job and joined Campbell’s in January of 1943. It was right in the middle of World War II so I figured this was a good place to be. I spent 43 years here until I retired in 1986.

Mick: Wow 43 years! Did you think you’d spend your whole career here when you first joined?

Daisy: I didn’t originally plan that but you never know what your future has in store. The Lord kept me here for a reason and I really enjoyed it.

Mick: What was your favorite position here?

Daisy: When I first joined at the old waterfront location I worked in the can division and loved it! I made the lids and body and put the labels on the cans. Towards the end of my career I moved over to another department and handled cooking for the executives.

Mick: Do you still eat Campbell’s soup?

Daisy: Of course! I just had some Campbell’s Cream of Mushroom soup for lunch the other day.

Mick: Is that your favorite soup?

Daisy: It’s one of them. The other is Chicken Gumbo!

Mick: Has your love of Campbell’s soup passed on to your children and grandchildren?

Daisy: Yes my son and daughter grew up on the brands and are huge fans to this day. From SpaghettiOs and soup to Swanson and Pepperidge Farm. Growing up we called them the original Campbell’s kids.

Daisy Lee with her family and Campbell’s employees.

Mick: You retired almost 40 years ago. How are you now spending your days?

Daisy: I take it easy since I’m retired! I’m also involved with my church.

Mick: You just turned 100 years old. What’s your secret?

Daisy: Serving the Lord doing right and eating and drinking well.

Mick: Thank you so much for the time Daisy and we hope you’ll come visit us again soon.

Daisy: Thank you for having me and my family. I hope you all will live to see 100.

Can It Reverse Downtown’s Post-Pandemic Slump? | DCist.com,"On November 30 2023 Executive Director Yesim Sayin was cited by DCist.

The neighborhoods around the arena are particularly impacted by federal workers being slow to return to offices says Yesim Sayin Executive Director of the D.C. Policy Center due to the presence of federal agencies like the FBI and the U.S. Government Accountability Office.

“Office buildings around Chinatown are largely empty. And in the downtown area which includes Chinatown [even] on the busiest days half the workers do not show up” Sayin says.

There’s also been a significant uptick in crime across the city including in Chinatown. Violent crime was up 36% in the neighborhood as of August according to D.C. Police.

Sayin cites the theory that the main deterrence of crime is the threat of being caught. If there are fewer people around there is less chance of being caught which can “embolden illegal activity” Sayin says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyZWRpdC5jb20vYmxvZy9yZXZpZXctY2FwaXRhbC1vbmUtc3BhcmstY2FzaC1wbHVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2023 Review: Capital One Spark Cash Plus,"Advertiser Disclosure: Credit.com has partnered with CardRatings for our coverage of credit card products.

Full Review of Capital One Spark Cash Plus

As far as business credit cards go the Capital One Spark Cash Plus offers a nice balance of features. You get a flat cash back rate of 2% across all spending categories and you get an intro offer of bonus_miles_full. Most importantly you have no preset spending limit – your spending limit adjusts on a month-to-month basis. (This means you will have to pay your card balance in full every month heads up).

So who is this card for? This is a great card if you’re a business owner with excellent credit who may have inconsistent expenses month-to-month and needs that spending limit flexibility and flat cash-back rate across all categories.

This is probably not an ideal card for someone who is looking to spread out their purchases with a credit card or is anticipating spending less than $150000 on business expenses in a year and can’t earn a refund on the annual fee.

What You’ll Like About This Card

No Preset Spending Limit

Like we said above Capital One Spark Cash Plus has no preset spending limit (or NPSL). What this means is that unlike a traditional credit card the credit card doesn’t have a fixed credit limit. This can be helpful for a couple of reasons:

Flexibility – NPSL provides businesses with flexibility in managing their expenses. For example if there’s an important purchase that you have to make or an emergency comes up you could temporarily exceed your traditional credit limit. Fluctuating Cash Flow – If income is unpredictable from month-to-month you could lean on your credit card to stretch to cover that loss. This is great if you own a business in an industry that’s heavily affected by seasonality like tourism or hospitality. Maximize your cash back – A NPSL feature combined with unlimited cash back rewards means that your cash back rewards aren’t capped by your credit limit.

With that being said not having a fixed credit limit doesn’t mean you have an unlimited credit limit. Your credit limit will still be dependent on your creditworthiness payment history and purchasing behavior. (You need credit_score_needed credit just to qualify for this card).

Cash Back Rewards

Let’s talk about the cash back rewards. You get a flat rate of 2% cash back on all purchases which is nice if your purchasing is varied and you don’t want to have to track spending categories.

You can also get 5% cash back when you book certain travel reservations – like rental cars or hotels – through Capital One Travel. You also get plenty of travel benefits such as TSA precheck services and access to the Capital One Lounge.

The Drawbacks

No Balance Carryover

Capital One Spark Cash Plus is a charge card which means you have to pay the balance off in full. So while you don’t have to worry about paying down interest or accumulating credit card debt you would have to worry about paying a late fee if you didn’t pay off the total balance. With this card you can be subject to a late fee of late_payment_fee.

Annual Fee

This card does have a annual_fees annual fee which is in the higher end for small business credit cards but definitely in the middle of the range when considered against the full list of business credit cards.

Is It Worth It?

Capital One Spark Cash Plus can be a good option for business owners who want an uncomplicated cash back card that can accommodate fluctuating monthly business expenses. However if you’re looking for a credit card that has a 0% intro APR or can help you spread large purchases out over a longer period of time you may want to look elsewhere.

Smith

Esau Grant a 29-year-old Newark resident has been found guilty by an Essex County jury for the robbery of the Capital One Bank on Springfield Avenue in Newark. The conviction follows a one-day trial overseen by Superior Court Judge Patrick J. Arre.

According to Spokesman Robert Floriday the incident which took place on July 3 2021 was captured on the bank's video surveillance.

Grant robbed a teller by handing over a note threatening the use of a gun demanding all the money from the register.

Complying with the demand the teller handed over $2300. Grant was apprehended and arrested by police just two days later. Assistant Prosecutor Ruddy A. Adames who prosecuted the case expressed gratitude to the jury for their service and delivering a just verdict.

Adames highlighted the importance of the teller's courageous testimony in court contributing significantly to the outcome.

He expressed hope that the verdict would bring a sense of security to both the teller and the community.

Grant's sentencing is scheduled for January 26 2024. He faces up to 10 years in New Jersey State Prison for second-degree robbery.

This verdict is seen as a testament to the effective functioning of the judicial system in dealing with criminal activities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlY2h0YXJnZXQuY29tL3NlYXJjaGNpby90aXAvNC1leGFtcGxlcy1vZi1kaWdpdGFsLXRyYW5zZm9ybWF0aW9uLXN1Y2Nlc3MtaW4tYnVzaW5lc3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Examples of Digital Transformation Success in Business,"Businesses are implementing digital transformation initiatives to gain faster time to market stay competitive and optimize the customer experience.

Despite challenging economic conditions 60% of enterprises told Boston Consulting Group X they were increasing their digital transformation investments in 2023. By 2025 the digital transformation market is expected to reach $1.458 trillion according to a recent report from Precedence Research.

Antony Edwards managing director at growth equity firm PSG classified digital transformation efforts into three types:

But unlocking digital transformation success is not everyone's forte. It is especially hard for businesses that have yet to embark on their transformation journey according to Parry Malm CEO and co-founder of Phrasee an AI company that makes natural language generation software.

Among companies pursuing digital transformation Malm expects large players will continue making gains because they've got the resources to course correct. The ability of small companies and startups to change and to outmaneuver big companies keeps them competitive. Midmarket companies are in danger of being squeezed out at either end according to Malm making it imperative they understand the systems and processes that lead to successful business transformations.

Digital transformation should also lead to more agile IT and engineering teams that enables them to execute projects in a much faster fashion these experts highlighted.

""People are more and more reliant on digital technology. … They want to do business with you on their cell phones and iPads. And unless you transform your business and accept that new reality you will get left behind"" Frugé said.

Executing on a digital transformation roadmap helps businesses stay relevant and expand their customer base by meeting ""consumers where they are"" said Jason Frugé consulting CISO at Risksilience a cyber security consultancy.

""With optimization the outcomes that you're getting are things like improved efficiency and improved engagement with customers"" she said. ""With transformation what you're focusing on is brand new revenue -- for example new digital products and services and new business models.""

Kristin Moyer an analyst in Gartner's CEO and digital business leader practice said that digital transformation done well optimizes and transforms a company's business.

Sanjay Srivastava chief digital strategist at Genpact said he sees enterprises across industries achieve an ROI from their digital transformation efforts when they deal with specific business imperatives -- rethinking customer experience increasing operational productivity and optimizing their supply chains . While technology is only part of the digital transformation equation the most successful efforts he sees take advantage of innovations in digital technologies data and AI.

To get the business benefits of digital transformation  companies should always focus on outcomes.

Notable examples of companies that achieved digital transformation success

Achieving success in digital transformation requires a clear vision and understanding across the organization experts agreed. Utilizing digital technologies is just one piece of the puzzle. Having the right leaders in place investing in talent and skills development instigating cultural and behavioral changes ensuring frequent and clear communication and digitizing tools and processes are important when driving transformational success.

Here's a look at seven notable examples of digital transformation success stories and what companies can learn from them.

1. Domino's Pizza

Domino's successful implementation of technology-driven transformation helped the pizza giant evolve into ""an e-commerce company that sells pizza"" according to Dennis Maloney the company's former chief digital officer who led the effort.

After the company's stock price plummeted in 2008 Domino's implemented an initiative aimed at revamping its menu and at using digital technology to increase agility. As part of its effort to deliver better products and services to customers the company launched Domino's Tracker a next-generation delivery technology that let customers follow the progress of their order online. Today Domino's AnyWare technology lets customers order in more ways on more devices.

The company has touted its use of artificial intelligence and machine learning technology to improve product quality as well as boost store and online operations. The company's multi-year experimentation with autonomous vehicles and drones for pizza delivery has kept Domino's in the vanguard of companies that push the boundaries of digital delivery.

Experts who have studied the company's success in infusing digital innovation into its business agreed that its new profile as the ""pizza experience company"" depended heavily on strong executive support. Creating an extensive and empowered IT department that collaborates with marketing counterparts to attract new and existing customers was also critical to the company's digital transformation.

""Domino's is an example of getting the infrastructure right"" Edwards said. ""They have put some fantastic infrastructure in place to make sure that whatever channel you want to go through you can order food from them. That makes for a seamless experience across different devices.""

2. Capital One

In 2012 Virginia-based credit card banking company Capital One embarked on a transformation journey to build ""a technology company that does banking instead of a bank that just uses technology"" CEO Richard Fairbank said. The stated goal was to deliver personalized banking service in real time.

Building on a modern technology stack the company used big data and machine learning to better understand customers. It brought in the talent required to build personalized apps adopted cloud computing and implemented agile software development and DevOps practices including the use of open source software.

In November 2020 it announced the closure of all on-premises data centers -- becoming the first U.S. bank to do so -- and moved all applications and systems to Amazon Web Services. This cloud-first policy helped Capital One and its digital transformation team move away from infrastructure management and focus on accelerating customer-centric innovation by using machine learning to turn data into insights.

""Capital One is someone who just went all in on digital"" Edwards said. ""They were nowhere near Wells Fargo or Bank of America [in 2012] but their digital transformation means they're getting all the new young subscribers to banking. They even brought in new executives to really transform into a digital company.""

3. Walmart

Walmart has been on a journey to transform itself into a technology and innovation company with the goals of making shopping faster and easier for its customers as well as offering new digital experiences.

Walmart changed its focus from ""re-platforming its e-commerce business"" to ""re-platforming across the board"" and put the digital transformation budget in place to do it spending $16.1 billion on technology in 2022 according to independent industry research.

It also forged several strategic partnerships to accelerate its transformation initiatives. It partnered with Microsoft to capitalize on the cloud giant's compute capacity to scale its artificial intelligence machine learning and data analytics initiatives as well as with Google for voice-enabled shopping.

The company consistently invested in digitalizing every aspect of its business -- from supply chain to sales customer service marketing and store operations -- to boost its operational and cost efficiency. Walmart's supply chain digitalization is integral to its omnichannel strategy success which helps the company serve customers through online mobile and in-store interactions.

What businesses can learn from Walmart's ""astounding digital transformation"" Edwards said is that they need to get the basics right.

""There's no magic in digital transformation"" he said. ""All Walmart did was do what people like about Amazon -- a really nice experience; customized great shipping; good prices -- and they just did that and didn't try to get over-fancy.""

4. Tesla

Electric car-maker Tesla is inarguably one of the most prominent examples of digital transformation success. By infusing technology into all facets of the driving experience the company has positioned itself as a change agent within the automotive industry.

From Tesla cars receiving over-the-air software updates to the company setting a high standard for customer experience Tesla has disrupted the traditional auto world in many ways.

Tesla's success can be attributed to three broad technology-driven choices: eliminating the middleman in the car-buying process extensively using digital technology to redefine how cars are built and driven and embracing its approach to innovation.

Tesla's direct-to-consumer model where it sells directly to consumers through its website and not through franchised dealerships lets Tesla control the buying experience.

Tesla's in-house production strategy -- a deviation from the industry norm of sourcing components from third-party suppliers -- not only provides cost advantages but also helps the company innovate quickly.

The velocity at which Tesla innovates -- the launch of Tesla Gigafactories to support Tesla's projected vehicle demand for example – gives the company a major advantage over legacy automakers.

Today Tesla's market capitalization is around $830 billion. It holds an 18% market share of global electric vehicle sales.

""The thing to learn from Tesla is be creative"" Edwards said. ""Anyone who says digital is not relevant to their market or category should think again and have another go at it.""

5. Automotive manufacturers adopt AR to expedite dealership repair service

Legacy car companies have been taking notes from Tesla to achieve similar gains. An example is the recent partnership between Indian IT services firm Tech Mahindra and a leading automaker to digitally reimagine the process of building and selling cars with the help of cutting-edge tools.

Working with Tech Mahindra the automaker has invested in augmented reality technology to improve collaboration between the automaker's technical experts and the after-sale service at their dealerships.

Krishna Bala Krishna Bala

In the past when cars came in with complex problems or issues that required rare performance part specifications that dealership mechanics couldn't resolve on their own manufacturing experts would have to visit the dealership or ship the problematic cars back to the plant for inspection said Krishna Bala a senior vice president in sales at Americas for Tech Mahindra. The AR software helps service technicians relay information to the plant experts efficiently resulting in faster and more accurate resolutions for complex vehicle service issues.

AR technology also improved end-customer and dealership employee satisfaction. ""The strong ties between their operational and technological wings allow them to be ahead of the curve in implementing digital solutions with minimal disruption to business"" Bala said.

6. Financial institutions boost earnings customer satisfaction with fin-tech

Jason Brucker Jason Brucker

Jason Brucker a managing director in the technology consulting practice at Protiviti recently worked with a leading financial institution that transformed its traditional operating model to a financial technology or fin-tech operating model pioneered by financial upstarts. The organization also underwent a substantial rebranding exercise in parallel to the operating model and digital transformation.

The CTO office initially kicked off the process focusing on driving these changes across the organization. However the CTO office quickly realized it first needed to establish greater alignment with business partners as well as optimize its own technology operating and governance models.

The company also established a business transformation office that reported to the CTO. This team focused on aligning portfolio management with risk management and process reengineering. This group also implemented a new goals framework with clear objectives aligned across the company and tied portfolio investment decisions to these goals. Equally important was a focus on transforming the enterprise governance structures as well as existing functional teams and processes.

Measurable benefits included improved efficiency growth in earnings per share faster partner engagement and integration improved employee engagement and reduced turnover. Although the overall transformation efforts were daunting in scope the organization saw results just a few months into their efforts. Brucker attributes this to success to enabling organizational change across the enterprise not just within technology teams or in small sections of the business.

7. Healthcare industry uses DX tech to compress drug development cycle

Srivastava points to the impact COVID-19 had on digital transformation across the healthcare industry. Faced with a global epidemic the industry compressed the typical eight-year drug development cycle to eight months to produce the COVID-19 vaccine.

This required digital transformation across processes used in drug discovery and clinical trials to dramatically accelerate speed to market. The most successful transformations also took advantage of recent innovations in data infrastructure and knowledge graphs to identify transformation opportunities and improve collaboration Srivastava said.

Now he is seeing many of these firms pivot from batch manufacturing and retailing mass medicines to precision medicine -- the ability to produce and deliver personalized medicine specific to a patient's DNA built on a new backplane of data IoT technology and analytics.

One takeaway from the most successful transformation projects in healthcare is that digital transformation is entirely different from digitalization Srivastava said. Digitalization is about automating end-to-end processes while digital transformation reimagines the total business process.

Srivastava said that digital transformation projects that deliver the greatest returns pay a lot of attention to ""how to integrate the digital solution back into the enterprise workflow redesign the experience around its consumption drive adoption reskill the team and change operating models to take advantage of it.""

Here’s a guide on who can apply and how to do it most easily.

Today is the day.

After nearly a decade of Republican delay and resistance North Carolina has officially expanded Medicaid. As of today Friday Dec. 1 some 600000 North Carolinians who made too much to previously apply for federal health insurance but too little to afford it on their own can enroll.

If you already have Medicaid you don’t need to do anything at all and should feel free to stop reading now. But if you have questions about whether you’re eligible how to apply and why you should apply this post is for you.

Who Can Apply?

You can enroll in Medicaid if you are:

A North Carolina resident.

19 to 64 years old.

A citizen (some non-U.S. citizens can get health coverage through NC Medicaid).

Meet the following annual income metrics before taxes:

Single adult – earn $20120 or less

Family of 2 – earn $27214 or less

Family of 3 – earn $34307 or less

Family of 4 – earn $41400 or less

Family of 5 – earn $48493 or less

Family of 6 – earn $55586 or less

About 300000 people already enrolled in the state’s Family Planning Medicaid program for reproductive health services will be automatically enrolled in the full program. Those automatically enrolled will get a confirmation letter from their local Department of Social Services.

Why Apply?

Medicaid pays for a significant range of healthcare services.

It covers doctor visits preventative care hospital stays maternity care vision and hearing dental services yearly check-ups emergency care mental health care substance abuse treatment and lots of other things. These services come free or at low cost.

Medicaid expansion has saved lives in the other states and prevented many rural hospitals from closing.

How to Apply

The fastest and most convenient way is online. There are a couple of steps but you won’t have to go anywhere in person and claims are usually processed faster this way. You can apply through the state’s secure ePASS website here. (Here’s a step-by-step ePASS guide and you’ll also need a North Carolina ID account which you can set up here.)

You can also apply in person at your local Department of Social Services (find yours here). You can also mail them your paper application but this will take longer of course.

However you apply here’s what you’ll need to provide as part of your application::

Certified birth certificates or other proof of citizenship/immigration status

Social Security cards or valid numbers. (If you applied for a number but don’t yet have it you can provide proof of the application.)

Two separate proofs of residency

Pay stubs from the last month

All existing medical or life insurance policies

A list of all vehicles owned by members of the household including make model year and VIN

Your most recent bank statements

Complete list of any property owned

Documents from all sources of income including Social Security and other federal benefits

If you don’t have all the information officials with the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services say to sign and submit the application anyway. They will follow up in a couple of weeks.

The total process can take about 45 days officials said.

If you don’t hear back within that time frame you can call 1-888-245-0179.

What took so long?

President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act opened the door for Medicaid in 2010. Ninety percent of the costs of expansion are paid for by the federal government but North Carolina was one of only 10 states to refuse to opt into the expansion.

State Republicans blocked any expansion efforts despite widespread support from medical groups Democrats and Gov. Roy Cooper.

The popularity of expansion became too big to ignore however especially in many conservative rural areas and many state Republicans buckled this year titling the momentum

An incentive in President Biden’s 2021 American Rescue Plan tipped things the rest of the way.

The law offered additional financial support for the states that had still not expanded Medicaid including a “signing bonus” the states could use however they wanted.

Republicans signed on and the legislature passed expansion in March even if they tied its implementation to the final adoption of the unrelated state budget which didn’t become law until October.

As of today that resistance and delay are over.

“Many eligible folks work 2 jobs take care of kids and parents and live busy lives” North Carolina Health and Human Services Secretary Kody Kinsley wrote on Twitter on Thursday.

The effort to expand Medicaid was a “marathon” he wrote but the work is not done. Just because someone is eligible doesn’t mean they know they are and hundreds of thousands of residents who are now eligible for coverage—but who won’t be automatically enrolled—will have to apply.

State health officials will increase their communication efforts to reach these individuals Kinsley said.

“This week. Next week. Next year. We’re working with civic orgs and faith leaders to spread the word and get folks covered” Kinsley added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vY2FyZGluYWxuZXdzLm9yZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAxL2ZlZHMtZ2l2ZS1ncmFudC10by1zdHVkeS13aWxkbGlmZS1jcm9zc2luZ3MtaW4tdmlyZ2luaWEtbW9yZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Feds give grant to study wildlife crossings in Virginia; more . . .,"Here’s a roundup of news briefs from around Southwest and Southside.

Feds give grant to study wildlife crossings in Virginia

The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Wildlife Crossings Pilot Program has awarded $604318 to the Virginia Department of Transportation.

The grant will allow VDOT to develop a statewide plan to identify roads with the highest risk of large mammal (such as deer bear and elk) collisions in the state according to a news release announcing the award. The plan will include geographic models to better identify wildlife crossing sites and provide site-specific recommendations.

This is potentially important to Southwest Virginia in particular where there’s now a herd of elk in Buchanan County that is expanding. A hunter in Giles County recently killed an elk that’s thought to have wandered away from that herd. (See our previous story on the elk.)

“This important funding will help the Virginia Department of Transportation create a plan to identify high-risk wildlife crossings and collision sites statewide” Rep. Morgan Griffith R-Salem said in the release. Identifying these potentially dangerous sites and developing improvement recommendations will help make roads safer for Virginians and animals alike.”

Virginia Veterans Care Center in Roanoke to be renamed

The Virginia Department of Veterans Services will host a renaming ceremony of the Virginia Veterans Care Center in Roanoke at 11 a.m. Dec. 12.

The Virginia Veterans Care Center will be officially renamed in honor of two military heroes with connections to Virginia. The names will be revealed during the ceremony according to a news release from the department.

Dedicated on Nov. 11 1992 —Veterans Day — the Virginia Veterans Care Center is a 224-bed comprehensive nursing facility offering short-term rehabilitative and long-term care options to qualified military veterans.

Since the opening of VVCC in 1992 DVS has also opened and is operating the Sitter & Barfoot Veterans Care Center in Richmond (January 2008) and the Jones & Cabacoy Veterans Care Center in Virginia Beach (November 2023). Plans are to open the new Puller Veterans Care Center now under construction in Fauquier County in 2024. Each of these centers is named in honor of military heroes and with the renaming so will be the Roanoke center.

A $1.53 million loan to be used to construct a new 20000- to 30000-square-foot shell building at Southern Gap was closed recently between the Virginia Coalfield Economic Development Authority and the Buchanan County Industrial Development Authority.

The IDA is currently without a single industrial type building to market according to a news release announcing the loan. The last industrial building constructed by the IDA was an 80000-square-foot shell building built in 2019 as part of Phase II of the Southern Gap industrial park. It was immediately taken by a local manufacturer Paul’s Fan Co.

“As leads for new projects and expansions are developed having available and ready industrial property to market is very important” Jonathan Belcher VCEDA’s executive director/general counsel said in a statement. “The current lack of marketable industrial buildings is causing Buchanan County to lose out on many opportunities and requests for proposals from prospective businesses. We are pleased to see the IDA take this step forward to build a new marketable building.”

The building will be expandable to 50000 square feet which is the largest size the site currently can accommodate. The proposed location for the building is on approximately 5 acres near Paul’s Fan Co. less than a half-mile from the U.S. 460/U.S. 121 (Coalfields Expressway) Southern Gap intersection.

The cruise industry faced unprecedented challenges during the height of the pandemic prompted by widespread travel restrictions and safety concerns. As a result revenue dried up and stock prices sank across the industry.

Despite the significant drops from pre-pandemic highs some investors see cruise stocks as potential bounceback candidates. One cruise stock Carnival Corporation (CCL) (CUK) is up roughly 80% in 2023. Let's look at whether it is a temporary uptick or if the performance signals a legitimate recovery for the cruise line operator.

Carnival's revenue is growing again

Revenue is the top line of the income statement because it is the first financial metric displayed representing the money a company generates from its primary business before any deductions or expenses. Most companies expect their revenue to increase by at least the rate of inflation each year or it might signal a fundamental problem with the business potentially leading to reduced profitability.

In the case of Carnival it wasn't necessarily a fundamental problem with the business that caused its revenue to crater; instead it was a once-in-a-century pandemic.

For Carnival's fiscal 2019 (the full year prior to the pandemic) the cruise line operator generated $20.8 billion in revenue. That number took a nosedive to $5.6 billion for its fiscal 2020 before bottoming out to $1.9 billion for its fiscal 2021. Then in Carnival's fiscal 2022 the turnaround story began. The company produced $12.2 billion in revenue as travel restrictions loosened.

Carnival has kept the momentum rolling during its fiscal 2023 generating $16.2 billion through its first three quarters. Notably the company recently reached a new fiscal third-quarter record of $6.3 billion in customer deposits surpassing its previous Q3 record of $4.9 billion in 2019.

Looking ahead President and CEO Josh Weinstein recently said he is ""pleased with [Carnival's] revenue trajectory heading into next year"" as the company's bookings are ""as far out as we've ever seen it.""

Carnival has a mountain of debt

Naturally as Carnival's revenue disappeared during the height of the pandemic the company was operating at a loss and needed to take on additional debt to stay afloat. As a result the company's net debt (total debt minus cash and cash equivalents) skyrocketed from $11 billion at the end of its fiscal year 2019 to $28.5 billion as of its most recent quarter or an increase of about 159%.

With rising interest rates Carnival's debt is becoming expensive to service. Specifically management expects Carnival to pay $1.9 billion in interest expenses for its fiscal year 2023. Additionally management said it expects to end its fiscal 2023 year with less than $31 billion of debt meaning Carnival's net debt could increase as much as $2.5 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter.

As a result of this massive debt Carnival's credit rating isn't investment grade. This means future debt will likely be much more expensive as it may need to find alternative ways to take out debt once its current loans come due. Management set a goal for the company to reach investment grade in 2026 but admits it ""still [has] a ways to go.""

The state of the cruise operators

Carnival is in the crowded industry of cruise line stocks so let's look at its competitors Norwegian Cruise Line (NYSE: NCLH) and Royal Caribbean (NYSE: RCL) for a comparison.

First looking at net debt both competitors are better positioned than Carnival with Norwegian's net debt recently coming in at $13.2 billion and Royal Caribbean's net debt at $19.4 billion. Royal Caribbean has been the most efficient at paying down its debt with management reducing it by 11% from its highs.

Next let's look at the valuation of each stock. The traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is a valuation metric that looks back at the trailing 12 months of earnings which is a useful tool for comparing similar companies. Considering each of these companies just recently returned to profitability the P/E ratio metric doesn't work. Instead the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio offers a better comparison given that people have returned to many pre-pandemic habits over the past 12 months. Royal Caribbean has the highest P/S ratio at 2.2 followed by Carnival at 0.9 and Norwegian at 0.8.

Put it all together the market is currently favoring Royal Caribbean likely due to its healthier balance sheet and demonstrating its ability to pay down a significant portion of debt.

Carnival Corporation Norwegian Cruise Line Royal Caribbean Ships 25 19 26 Market capitalization $19.1 billion $6.2 billion $27.2 billion Net debt $28.5 billion $13.2 billion $19.4 billion Revenue (TTM) $20 billion $8.1 billion $13.2 billion Price-to-sales ratio 0.9 0.8 2.2 Net income (most recent quarter) $1.1 billion $346 million $1.0 billion

Is Carnival Cruise Lines a buy?

Despite Carnival stock's run-up in 2023 it is still down roughly 80% from its all-time high and management is unlikely to reinstate its dividend anytime soon. While the cruise line operator shows signs of positive momentum with rising bookings and revenue the looming challenge lies in its escalating debt which will become progressively more costly to manage.

The company's journey back to prosperity might resemble turning around a cruise ship in a bathtub -- requiring time and encountering choppy waters along the way. With that in mind Carnival investors should consider holding its stock for now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFsYmlvbi5lZHUvZXMvZXZlbnQvd2ludGVyLWNhcm5pdmFsLTIwMjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SAAC Annual Winter Carnival,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNydWlzZWhpdmUuY29tL2Nhcm5pdmFsLWNydWlzZS1saW5lLW1ha2VzLXNpZ25pZmljYW50LXBhY2thZ2UtcHJpY2UtaGlrZS8xMTcxOTXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Carnival Cruise Line Makes Significant Package Price Hike,"Carnival Cruise Line has announced changes to its Wi-Fi package pricing with rates increasing from Friday December 8 2023. Booked guests do have a few days to lock in lower rates if they pre-pay for an internet package before the rate increase takes effect.

Internet Prices Increasing on All Carnival Cruise Ships

Carnival Cruise Line has emailed booked guests and affiliated travel partners to alert them to an upcoming increase in Wi-Fi internet packages across the Carnival fleet with new pricing starting on Friday December 8 2023.

All package prices will increase for both pre-cruise and onboard purchases. The rate changes are as follows (all in USD):

Social Plan

This is Carnival’s least expensive plan allowing guests to stay connected to family and friends back home via social media and apps including Facebook Snapchat Instagram and several others. This plan also includes access to the most popular airline websites in case travelers need to check in for flights or make travel arrangements.

Current pricing is $12.75 per day when purchased before sailing or $15 per day when purchased onboard. From December 8 the rate will increase to a pre-cruise price of $15.30 per day and $18 per day when purchased onboard an increase of 20% regardless of when the package is purchased.

Guests should note that the Social Plan does not include access to email streaming services video chats or most websites.

Value Plan

The most popular Wi-Fi plan is the Value Plan which includes not only social media and airline websites but also news sports weather banking and entertainment sites – though not streaming services. The speed for the package is faster and guests can easily post pictures using the Value Plan.

Cruise Wi-Fi

Before the increase this plan is $17.00 per day when purchased pre-cruise or $20.00 per day when purchased onboard. After December 8 the price will increase to $19.55 per day when bought before sailing or $23.00 per day when bought onboard after embarkation. This is an increase of 15% over the current pricing.

Premium Plan

The fasted internet speeds with the most access to social networking email websites and apps including several types of video calling and conferencing the Premium Plan is a great option for passengers who must stay connected while at sea either for their own enjoyment or for some work requirements or other obligations though video and music streaming are still not supported.

Currently Carnival’s Premium Wi-Fi Plan is available for $18.70 per day before cruises or $22.00 per day onboard. From December 8 the new pricing will be $21.25 per day for pre-cruise purchases or $25 per day when purchased onboard the ship. Either way this is a 13.6% increase for the package price.

Savings Can Be Locked In

Booked guests – or those who complete a booking prior to Friday December 8 – can still lock in the lower rates by pre-paying for internet packages before the rate increase goes into effect regardless of when their cruise sets sail.

“Make sure to add your Wi-Fi package early to lock in the current package price for your upcoming cruise” the notification email read.

Pre-booking before the price increase can be a significant savings depending on the package travelers choose and the length of their sailing as longer cruises and stronger internet packages command higher savings.

These price increases follow similar price increases Carnival Cruise Line implemented in mid-October for Australia cruises.

Guests interested in booking internet packages should note that all packages must be purchased for the full length of a cruise and are not available on a day-by-day basis.

Furthermore no internet plan is necessary to use the Carnival Hub App which is essential for keeping up with onboard activities menus showtimes and announcements during each cruise.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vY3J1aXNlaW5kdXN0cnluZXdzLmNvbS9jcnVpc2UtbmV3cy8yMDIzLzEyL2Etc2hvcnRlci1jYXJuaXZhbC1wYW5vcmFtYS1oZWFkcy10b3dhcmQtZHJ5ZG9jay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Shorter Carnival Panorama Heads Toward Drydock,"A shorter Carnival Panorama with a shaved funnel can now squeeze under any air restrictions as the ship sails the Columbia River for the Vigor Shipyard in Portland.

Carnival cancelled a number of cruises on the ship to fix a propulsion issue having secured a shipyard slot in Portland and OEM manufacturer help and logistics.

Meanwhile to get to the Portland shipyard the 2019-built Panorama first had to visit Victoria Canada to have most of its funnel removed.

Following the drydock in Portland the ship will then head back to Victoria to have its funnel re-installed and then be ready to resume revenue service from Long Beach later this month with a Dec. 23 holiday cruise.

(Photo/Screenshot from China Central Television)

China's third aircraft carrier the Fujian is holding mooring tests and will progress its construction steadily according to plan the Chinese Ministry of National Defense (MOD) revealed on Thursday amid speculations by foreign media reports saying that the Fujian recently tested its electromagnetic catapult system with a test vehicle in preparation for its upcoming maiden voyage.

Senior Colonel Wu Qian an MOD spokesperson disclosed the information at a regular press conference on Thursday in response to a question from the Global Times.

Mooring tests aim to check the completeness and reliability of the building and construction of the hull the propulsion system the mechanical equipment the electrical devices and other devices and to make necessary adjustments to ensure the ship can sail Zhang Xuefeng a Chinese military expert told the Global Times on Thursday.

When the mooring tests are completed the navigation tests or sea trials may begin Zhang said.

Citing a video recorded from an airplane flying over the shipyard facilities in Shanghai where the carrier is currently berthed US media outlet Newsweek reported on Monday that the Fujian has trialed its catapult aircraft launch system.

The video showed the launch and subsequent drop of a test vehicle from one of the catapult positions on the Fujian Newsweek said.

The report also said that the testing marked another significant step toward the carrier's full completion.

Fu Qianshao another Chinese military expert told the Global Times on Thursday that the Fujian is the first Chinese aircraft carrier to be equipped with electromagnetic catapults and arresting devices. He said that this is a new and complex technology that requires testing during the mooring tests before the navigation tests.

Launching test vehicles can examine the catapults' parameters including power and acceleration which will provide bases for the Fujian to eventually host aircraft takeoff and landing tests during future navigation tests Fu said.

The Newsweek report also speculated that the Fujian could soon make its maiden voyage for sea trials citing recent satellite imagery analysis that implied the carrier had been relocated from its original position.

Chinese military expert and TV commentator Song Zhongping agrees that the maiden voyage for the Fujian is approaching.

The presence of a carrier support ship near the Fujian was reported by US-based think tank Center for Strategic & International Studies on November 21.

Song said it indicates that the carrier's sea trial is not far away.

Experts said that navigation tests will usually examine comprehensively the warship's subsystems including the propulsion radar communications weapons aviation and catapult systems at sea.

Usually sea trials for aircraft carriers take about one year and as the Fujian features many new technologies it cannot be ruled out that its testing could be longer than that of China's first domestically developed carrier the Shandong observers said.

With a full displacement of more than 80000 tons the Fujian is China's first carrier equipped with electromagnetic catapults and arresting devices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vYmlsZXdvcmxkbGl2ZS5jb20vZGlzaC1uZXR3b3JrL2Rpc2gtbmV0d29yay1jbGFpbXMtZ2xvYmFsLTVnLXZvbnItbGVhZGVyc2hpcC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dish Network claims global 5G VoNR leadership,"Dish Network claimed to have the greatest coverage for a commercial 5G Voice over New Radio (VoNR) service in the world after expanding availability to 12 additional areas as it seeks to step-up competition with established US operators.

Certain members of that expedition spent the better part of a year on this remote Siberian island after their ship was crushed by ice and Captain Bob Bartlett played Chopin’s “Funeral March” on his Victrola to accompany its sinking. Those who survived their lengthy stay on Wrangel were rescued by the Canadian schooner King and Winge in September of the following year.

Near Cape Litke I happened to see not a tattered glove from one of the Karluk’s castaways but an arctic woolly bear caterpillar (Gynaephora groenlandica) basking on a small rock and looking like it didn’t have a care in the world. This isn’t the same species as the temperate woolly bear (Pyrrharctia isabella) which is commonly thought to predict winter weather — the thicker its brown stripes the warmer the winter will be. Rather it was an endemic High Arctic species that doesn’t predict winter weather so much as triumph over it.

I kneeled to get a closer look at this tan-brown thumb-sized creature. The temperature was slightly below freezing and like me it was wearing a parka. Or I should say it was covered with the equivalent of a parka — thick bristly hairs called setae that provide it with external insulation and help it absorb as well as retain heat.

A clever sunbather

Speaking of heat retention the caterpillar can raise its body temperature 42˚C (75˚F) above the air simply by basking in the sun. It does this basking much of the time when it’s not feeding or searching for food. No high-intensity workouts for it! As the summer progresses it becomes increasingly chubby since chubbiness is a good survival morphology in the Arctic.

Quite a few members of the Karluk Expedition suffered from hypothermia

during their time on Wrangel. If an arctic woolly bear caterpillar could talk it

might have said “Try to synthesize some glycerol guys” to these shivering men. Glycerol is a compound that the caterpillar manufactures to keep its body cavity from freezing.

Several members of the Karluk Expedition also ended up with Hypervitaminosis A from eating polar bear liver. As a result they suffered from fatigue and nausea along with bits of their skin peeling off. If the caterpillar had been able to talk it might have said “Eat arctic willow leaves” to these distressed individuals. For the buds and leaves of this creeping shrub (Salix arctica) are its primary food from June until mid-July after which the buds are gone and the leaves turn yellow and lack nutrients.

Voluntary hypothermia

In late summer the caterpillar heads down to a sheltered site close to the permafrost and creates a silken hibernaculum as its winter home. Then it undergoes what Olga Kukal the world’s leading G. groenlandica expert calls “voluntary hypothermia.” Frozen solid like a popsicle it has no worries except for the occasional parasitoid wasp or fly that overwinters as a larva inside it and while doing so feeds on it.

Come spring the caterpillar thaws itself out and again begins to eat arctic willow buds and leaves or if none of these are around on purple saxifrage leaves. By contrast I suspect that if Sir John Franklin’s doubtless frozen body is ever found and thawed out the result would be a foul-smelling heap of carrion incapable of eating a ship’s biscuit or even an Arctic willow leaf.

The first person to spend any time studying arctic woolly bears was James Ross (1800-1862) the naturalist on his uncle Sir John Ross’s 1829 Arctic expedition. Best known for his discovery of the Magnetic North Pole James Ross collected a number of frozen woolly bears on Fury Island in the Gulf of Boothia. He brought them into the expedition’s warm cabin where (he wrote) “every one of them returned to life and continued walking about…”

Survives for 14 winters

Ross probably didn’t realize that the caterpillar freezes and thaws each

year for a remarkable 14 years. And whatever the lowest temperature might have been on his uncle’s expedition it wouldn’t have been nearly as low as the temperature the woolly bear is able to tolerate. What would that temperature be you might wonder? At least -71˚C (-95˚F)!

After 14 years the caterpillar has gotten enough resources to pupate and become an arctic woolly bear moth. Compared to a luna moth or a monarch butterfly this grayish-black moth isn’t a particularly attractive lepidopteran. But what matters to it is not beauty but sex — it must find a mate and lay eggs in a short time because its life span is no more than two weeks. That the moth unlike the caterpillar isn’t frost-proof makes it all the more eager to find a mate.

Back to the caterpillar. You would expect it to be present in Inuit folklore given its seemingly folklorish behavior. Might there be a story about a woman who marries a G. groenlandica because it’s much braver than any man she knows? I never heard such a story nor did I hear any lore about arctic woolly bear quklurriat (caterpillars) during my meetings with Inuit.

Actually I did hear one tidbit of lore. In Upernavik West Greenland I once met an Inuk who told me his father wore a neck amulet with an arctic woolly bear encased in it. Since the caterpillar can survive extremely frigid conditions his father figured this amulet might help him do so too. And it worked the fellow said with a grin. For shortly after he created the amulet the government moved his father from a poorly heated turf hut to a well-heated home for elders.

In the end I didn’t find a single relic from the Karluk Expedition. But I did find something perhaps more interesting than a relic — a furry little creature far better adapted to the cold than almost any other insect not to mention most members of my own species.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy53bGZpLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2NhdC1zbWFydC1mb3VuZHJ5LWlzLWJyaW5naW5nLW5ldy1vcHBvcnR1bml0aWVzLXRvLXB1cmR1ZS9hcnRpY2xlXzA2NzJlZDZhLTkwMmMtMTFlZS04ZDEwLWQzZjJlMjQ0ZTA3Yy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CAT Smart Foundry is bringing new opportunities to Purdue,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

Fuel flexibility is one of the pillars of decarbonization that is being embraced by genset OEMs. Fuel efficiency a second pillar goes hand in hand with that because new fuels will be more expensive but these concerns come in addition to the on-going drive to reduce CapEx and OpEx for shipowners.

MAN Energy Solutions introduced its auxiliary MAN 35/44DF CD engine in June 2023. It is designed to be future-proof and will be ready for methanol operation by 2026. Sephardim Koblenz Head of Licensing MAN Energy Solutions notes though: “Both shipyards and shipowners greatly appreciate auxiliary engines that are easily installed and maintained while reliability and cost-optimization are also key.”

MAN also recently received its first order for small-bore seven-cylinder MAN 21/31DF-M methanol-burning gensets for six PCTCs being built by China Merchants Heavy Industry for China Merchants Energy Shipping. The 21/31DF-M is based on a simple port fuel-injection concept that optimizes reliability while simultaneously minimizing capital outlay.

“The foundation for the new L21/31DF-M genset is the existing L21/31 genset which has accumulated more than 55 million operating hours with thousands of engines in service” says Bjarne Foldager Senior Vice President and Head of Two-Stroke Business. “The L21/31DF-M power range spans 1000-1980kW which makes it suitable for most merchant vessels.”

Foldager expects methanol to figure prominently as a future fuel across all vessel segments. “The new genset benefits from the high reliability high performance and fuel flexibility of the 21/31 engine platform while the possibility to operate on green methanol as a drop-in fuel increases its fuel-flexibility. Simultaneously it also increases methanol's potential as an option for genset power generation aboard large marine merchant vessels.”

Other OEMs also have new fuel developments on-going. HHI-EMD has developed a 4-stroke HiMSEN methanol engine and Caterpillar Marine is designing alternative-fuel gensets with a current focus on methanol. Yanmar Power Technology is concurrently developing hydrogen ammonia and methanol engines and has commercialized a hydrogen fuel cell system.

Volvo Penta and CMB.TECH have collaborated to create dual-fuel hydrogen engines and CMB.TECH’s collaboration with DBR has seen the development of dual fuel hydrogen gensets. The core of the technology is the proven MAN V12-24l engine. The genset has a maximum output of 940kVA / 752 kWe at 60 Hz (1800 rpm) and can operate on diesel or in dual fuel mode where emission savings of up to 83% can be achieved. The genset is also available in 50Hz (1500rpm) which can deliver 822kVA of power.

Wärtsilä announced in August that it will supply methanol-fueled Wärtsilä 32M auxiliary gensets for six 15000 TEU container ships which are being built at the Dalian Shipbuilding for CMA CGM. Future fuels development is a key part of Wärtsilä’s decarbonization strategy but when asked what the most important developments in gensets were Janne Klemola General Manager Product Management – Wärtsilä Marine Power said: maximizing fuel efficiency.

“That’s why one of the most important developments in gensets is around improving the reliability of the power - this can support with driving higher fuel efficiency and in turn lowering overall emissions from a vessel. What’s more if you can also extend the time needed between overhauls and/or major repairs - through using cutting edge artificial intelligence and advanced diagnostics – this can help vessel owners improve asset efficiency and reduce both operating costs and emissions.”













Janne Klemola: One of the most important developments in gensets is around improving the reliability of the power. Image courtesy of Wärtsilä.





Klemola sees this as part of a larger endeavor to continue to refine and enhance genset technology. Another part is the ongoing development of genset automation and integration of controls with other systems such as energy storage systems.

Mark Harrison Product Strategy Manager for Caterpillar Marine says: “The most important developments that we are seeing in gensets at the moment is how they are being applied differently in modern power systems. How can we best utilize batteries hybrids and gensets in harmony to achieve our objectives? Can those benefits overcome the inherent CapEx and OpEx challenges? At Caterpillar we are focusing on overall system efficiency: Are our generators optimally sized? Are those generators operating at peak efficiency? Can we start or stop a genset to operate at a more efficient point from an overall vessel perspective? Are we optimizing the usage of electrons versus fuel molecules for the best blend of reliability and efficiency?”

The days of simply specifying in gensets seems to be fading quickly he says. “Customers now need to decide more than ever if larger gensets for reliability are more important than smaller more power dense ones based on how they are expected to operate in real life. One specific change we are expecting is the generators of the future (integrated into hybrid systems) will operate at much higher load factors. Have we optimized the gensets for this new reality?”

A modular hybrid and fuel-flexible approach to onboard power has the potential change thinking about gensets and ship design and it is becoming evident in newbuilding orders. Dutch shipping company Transtal Shipping has signed a contract with Thecla Bodewes Shipyards for the construction of a 5100-dwt diesel-electric multi-purpose vessel. Fuel flexibility is key to the design which incorporates three gensets and two electric motors. The vessel is ready for future fuels such as methanol or hydrogen with space reserved on board for alternative energy sources without having to replace the electric propulsion system.

Sam Gombra co-founder of ÈTA Shipping came up with a highly flexible solution for a coastal cargo ship. The design ÈTA 6700 is initially diesel-electric but is designed so that it can sail on methanol ammonia or hydrogen in the future. There is no main engine. Initially power is provided by three 600kW Mitsubishi generators each installed in its own container but it is possible to incorporate any containerized sustainable power source. Gombra estimates that it will take less than a day to remove the existing power generation system and replace it without the need for a shipyard. The company has already partnered with Mercuria on a series of vessels expected to be delivered starting in 2025.

Transtal Shipping and Mercuria are demonstrating the desire for fuel flexibility shipowners have as they endeavor to balance regulation with technology developments and economics. Genset OEMs are working to ensure their CapEx and OpEx can be minimized as well.

JPMorgan analysts said slow growth of Canadian ETFs shows how overblown the US hype is.

Analyst Eric Balchunas disagrees and explains why ""it looks pretty good"" for the US.

Canada stamped itself as a pioneer when it approved the world’s first spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund — the Purpose Bitcoin ETF — back in February 2021.

There have been hiccups since but the funds have seen a resurgence in 2023.

The Canadian ETF explosion can be used as a proxy for what will follow in the “massive” US market Eric Balchunas an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence told DL News.

Assets under management at the Purpose Bitcoin ETF the world’s largest spot Bitcoin exchange traded fund soared 60% to over 947 million Canadian dollars this year according to Cboe Global Markets’ Canadian arm. In US dollars that’s almost $700 million.

Balchunas noted that the US ETF market is 32 times that of Canada’s.

“Based on Canada if you extrapolate it looks pretty good” he said.

Canada’s spot Bitcoin ETF market share sits at 48% of all global spot crypto ETFs at around $2 billion in assets according to CoinGecko.

The global market is worth about $4.2 billion. South of the border Balchunas has been tracking fund giants BlackRock Fidelity Ark Invest and the handful of other firms awaiting spot Bitcoin ETF approval — expected in January.

Optimism surrounding a Securities and Exchange Commission nod has helped drive Bitcoin 126% higher this year.

ETF performance

Canadian spot ETFs were initially predicted to be a game-changer but when the Purpose Bitcoin ETF launched in 2021 its performance was underwhelming.

Expected to rise to over $1 billion in assets under management within a week inflows to Purpose in early weeks went slower than anticipated.

By April 2022 the ETF had amassed a record $1.7 billion in assets but that figure was quickly washed away by the Terra collapse in May.

Like many crypto markets ETFs wallowed through 2022 and only started to recover this January.

In June JPMorgan said there was “little interest” in Canadian ETFs using it as an example to why the US ETF hype might be overblown.

Others reject that analysis — including Balchunas and Canadian regulators.

The Ontario Securities Commission wrote in a 2023 report that “much of the decline in AUM is due to the declining value of cryptocurrencies rather than significant fund outflows.”

Balchunas noted that crypto ETF flows accounted for 5% of all flows in Canada this year. The increase in assets under management in the market adds up to 23% organic growth a number Balchunas said is undeniable.

“The JPMorgan thing baffled me” Balchunas said.

Canada’s ETF-friendly past

Canada has a history of pushing out ETFs well ahead of the US as far back as the world’s first ETF called the TIPs 35 Fund which launched in 1990.

The US followed up with the SPY ETF in 1993. Balchunas cites Canada’s first cannabis ETF launched in 2017 as another example where Canada beat the US to the ETF punch — it took the US nearly four years to approve a similar product.

Balchunas cites “conservative” regulators in the US compared to Canada’s “more liberal” regime.

Still Balchunas says the tendency has been for US approval to follow.

“Once the first ETF in the asset class breaks through the rest will be approved” he said.

Road to SEC approval

Performance of Canada’s ETFs isn’t the whole story.

The road to spot ETF approval has not gone smoothly — the SEC has rejected every application to date and on Tuesday delayed approval of Franklin Templeton’s proposed ETF.

The SEC has raised concerns that spot ETFs may be vulnerable to market manipulation and fraud. It has asked the public to express its concerns with such issues.

Canada on the other hand approved the crypto ETFs in short order and has arguably stricter regulatory controls — the country rolled out a series of rules in 2022 which saw several major crypto firms exit the country including leading global exchange Binance.

“The most important difference between Canada and the US right now is regulatory certainty in Canada” Laure Fouin partner at Canadian law firm Osler Hoskin & Harcourt wrote in an email to DL News.

Fouin pointed to explicit crypto-related guidance issued by the Canadian Securities Administrators which included agency expectations for crypto asset funds.

Crypto firms in the US have long advocated for the SEC to produce explicit guidance for crypto assets.

SEC Chair Gary Gensler has insisted that existing securities regulations are sufficient.

The SEC has so far only approved Bitcoin-related funds tied to futures contracts.

At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.20% per year. These returns cover a period from January 1 1988 through April 1 2024. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can and often do change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available pricing information was not collected or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations. Zacks may license the Zacks Mutual Fund rating provided herein to third parties including but not limited to the issuer.

The transaction comes on the heels of an $8.5 million deal in Hoboken also handled by CBRE for Airn.

The 30000-square-foot land parcel in North Bergen located on the Hudson River waterfront was acquired by a private local developer based in Hudson County.

The CBRE team of Fahri Ozturk Richard Gatto and Zach McHale along with Jeff Babikian spearheaded the marketing campaign for the site which is part of seven-property 450-plus-unit portfolio along the New Jersey Gold Coast that CBRE has been appointed to sell on behalf of a court-appointed restructuring management team. The CBRE team was also responsible for procuring the buyer.

“The buyer fully recognized the unique development opportunity the site presented and acted quickly to secure the deal resulting in a hard contract at signing” Ozturk said. “We are excited to see how the new development reshapes that section of River Road.”

Gatto added: “This sale comes on the heels of our recent closing in Hoboken for the seller. The closing of this deal further proves the strong appetite we are seeing from investors for both entitled/unentitled development opportunities in prime locations such as River Road in North Bergen.”

The site is located across from Edgewater Harbor a lifestyle center featuring top restaurants and retailers including Moe’s Southwest Grill Dunkin’ Haven Riverfront Restaurant & Bar Five Guys HomeGoods CVS and Pier 115 among others.

""The fear of a seizure's unpredictability is sometimes more debilitating than the seizures themselves impacting not just patients' lives but also their mood relationships and opportunities. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy—accounting for approximately 40% of deaths in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy—adds a haunting layer to the constant worry of injury and death that lingers with continued seizures.”

Epilepsy stands as a prevalent neurological condition on a global scale constituting a persistent challenge in daily life for those impacted by seizures. Patients with epilepsy often contend with heightened comorbidities notably experiencing elevated rates of depression anxiety and cognitive impairment. Also factors such as frequent seizures adverse treatment effects and employment uncertainties contribute to a lower quality of life in patients with epilepsy. Thus the research in this area underscores the impact of illness and unmet needs especially among those with drug-resistant epilepsy and suggests a need for attention to novel treatments for this condition.1

SK Life Science is hosting a symposium at the 2023 American Epilepsy Society Annual Meeting held December 1-5 in Orlando Florida titled “Impact of Continued Seizures and Strategies for Seizure Reduction/Freedom” that will be led by a group of experts in epilepsy.2 The company noted that the symposium will discuss currently available strategies for reducing and achieving seizure freedom and the need to better understand unmet needs for achieving seizure freedom the impact of continued seizures on patients. Additionally in the symposium experts will speak on evidence-based treatment adjustments before patients consider surgery and the various treatment options available to support patients in their epilepsy journey.

Prior to the upcoming symposium one of the speakers Danielle Becker MD MS FAES division director of epilepsy and associate professor of neurology at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center had a brief conversation with NeurologyLive® to provide an overview of the main points she planned to speak of in the presentation. She talked about how the fear of seizures even for those seemingly seizure-free can affect patients' lives and mental well-being. Becker also spoke about the role that the ongoing worry of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy may play in the psychological landscape of individuals with drug-resistant epilepsy. In addition she explained how societal factors such as limitations on driving and employment could compound the challenges faced by individuals grappling with persistent seizures.

Lyda Hill the 81-year-old granddaughter of wildcatter H.L. Hunt has funneled millions of philanthropic and investment dollars into developing the industry in her hometown. In September her marquee project an office campus modeled after the Kendall Square innovation district near MIT scored a big win when it was named one of the three headquarters for the federal government’s new health research institutes.

Hill is extending a family tradition in helping shape Dallas. Her grandfather and assorted relatives were instrumental in turning the city into a center for oil and gas and she’s now seeking to usher in what she hopes is its next era.

Her biotech push is coming up against the city’s geographic sprawl and a relative lack of capital compared with hubs like Boston or San Francisco. But it echoes efforts by cities including Chicago and Salt Lake City which are trying to cash in on a windfall of public and private funding for biomedical manufacturing and research in the aftermath of the pandemic.

Winning the research institute caps a successful start for Hill’s 30-month-old campus known as Pegasus Park. It beat out Massachusetts to lure the headquarters for a $1 billion “de-extinction” startup called Colossal Biosciences that is seeking to revive the woolly mammoth along with the Tasmanian tiger and other long-gone species. Just this week the company announced an agreement with the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation to host dodo birds if it’s successful in reviving them.

BioLabs a co-working company focused on the life sciences industry has its only US location outside the coastal states at Pegasus Park. And now it will have the new federal research hub that will focus on project management for biotech studies and trials.

Hill who declined a request for an interview is from one of the most prominent Dallas dynasties though she zealously guards her privacy. Her grandfather an avid gambler who grew up on an Illinois farm turned a $50 loan into what eventually became one of the largest US oil companies with Life Magazine calling him the richest man in the US in 1948.

He had 15 children including Hill’s mother Margaret Hunt Hill who has an iconic bridge named after her over the Trinity River in Dallas. Lamar Hunt founded the American Football League and created the Super Bowl.

Many of the descendants of H.L. Hunt have gone on to be influential figures mostly in Dallas but also Kansas City and Chicago. They’ve built skyscrapers and bought sports teams and used their fortunes to give back. Clark Hunt chief executive of the Kansas City Chiefs leads the Hunt Family Foundation that focuses on providing basic necessities for those in need. Luxury hotel magnate Caroline Rose Hunt who died in 2018 joined with her grandchildren to donate $5 million to United Way of Metropolitan Dallas in 2015.

“There’s a reputation for wealth building but there’s also a reputation for setting that aside in favor of community building and doing something that’s gonna benefit the city long term” said Cal Jillson a professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.

Hill has done just that in the life sciences industry partly motivated by her own battle with breast cancer. Her charitable donations include $50 million to the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center’s Moon Shots Program; $50 million to the UT Southwestern Medical Center that was partly used to create the Lyda Hill Department of Bioinformatics; $20 million to the Hockaday School a private all girls school in Dallas to fund science-focused programs; and $30 million to the Dallas-based Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute.

On the investment side she provided early funding to Peloton Therapeutics which was acquired by Merck & Co. in 2019.

For now most of her attention is going to Pegasus Park which seeks to overcome one of Dallas’s most vexing challenges to becoming a biotech hub. Cities like Boston San Francisco and New York enjoy a concentration of capital entrepreneurs and academia in a small area. Dallas struggles with dispersion — while the city’s population is 1.3 million the sprawling Dallas-Fort Worth metro area boasts some 8 million residents.

“Metros that are the size of DFW historically have challenges finding a way to keep these companies clustered together in the same neighborhood” said Travis McCready the head of the life sciences practice in the Americas at JLL a $7 billion global real estate company.

The 26-acre campus sits near the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center a research institute that employs six Nobel laureates. Several of the professors work on startups that operate out of BioLabs. And the campus is expanding — construction has started on a new wing that will be a laboratory facility.

Steve Case the billionaire co-founder of AOL said during a visit to Pegasus Park in September that such hubs can fuel innovation just by bringing together people from different companies and institutions who wouldn’t normally collaborate.

“The very beginning of what’s happening here is quite encouraging and I think bodes well for this next chapter” said Case who now runs investment firm Revolution which focuses on investments in places outside of traditional venture hubs like San Francisco and Boston.

What Dallas lacks and what Case’s firm is trying to solve is access to capital. Venture capital funding in Dallas was $157 million in the third quarter versus $10.2 billion in San Francisco and $3.5 billion in Boston according to PitchBook data.

BioLabs has been hosting informal meetings at Old Parkland an office park in Dallas that houses asset management firms to tout investment opportunities at Pegasus Park. Gabby Everett a scientist and director of the Dallas Biolabs site said there are ongoing discussions between some founders and investors.

Hill’s representatives say her involvement in Pegasus Park includes a mix of philanthropic efforts and for-profit investments but declined to provide a detailed breakdown.

Another developer is looking to cash in on the biotech industry in North Texas. NexPoint founder James Dondero has proposed a $4 billion project that would convert Ross Perot’s former Electronic Data Systems campus in the Dallas suburb of Plano into a life sciences hub. NexPoint received rezoning approval from the Plano city council in November.

The region is already home to major life science firms including Irving-based McKesson Corp. and Galderma which has its US headquarters in Fort Worth. The DFW airport was one of the first in the country to support cold chain cargo for pharmaceutical shipments.

Texas economist Ray Perryman said North Texas has all the ingredients for a thriving life sciences community including a large and expanding population skilled workforce quality health care systems research and education centers and a vibrant financial sector.

“Dallas-Fort Worth has tremendous potential to be a biotech life sciences hub of global significance” he said. “The industry has been growing very rapidly and it’s viewed favorably by the investment community.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vc2NpdGVjaGRhaWx5LmNvbS9jb3NtaWMtY2FydG9ncmFwaHktbWlzc2lvbi1uYXNhcy1pbWFwLXRvLXNldC1zYWlsLWZvci1pbnRlcnN0ZWxsYXItbWFwcGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cosmic Cartography Mission: NASA's IMAP To Set Sail for Interstellar Mapping,"IMAP set for launch in late April to May 2025 marks a key phase in space exploration focusing on mapping solar wind interactions and the heliosphere’s boundary. This NASA-led mission with broad international collaboration also features a unique public live feed of its development.

The Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) has successfully completed Key Decision Point D (KDP-D). This milestone allows the mission to move from development and design to the assembly testing and integration phase. IMAP’s planned launch date which was no earlier than February 2025 was also reevaluated during the KDP-D and was moved to a target launch window from late April to late May 2025 to ensure that the project team has adequate resources to address risks and technical complexities during system integration and testing.

Role and Impact of IMAP

IMAP will function as a modern-day cartographer and will help us understand what happens when the solar wind (a constant stream of particles from the Sun) collides with materials from interstellar space. This will help researchers map the boundary of the heliosphere the magnetic bubble created by the solar wind and better understand how this magnetic bubble protects Earth from large amounts of harmful cosmic radiation. IMAP will be positioned about one million miles from Earth and its instruments will collect and study the particles that make it through the heliosphere.

Collaborative Efforts and Public Engagement

Principal investigator and Princeton University professor David McComas leads the IMAP mission which has an international team of more than 20 partner institutions. Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) is managing the development phase is building the spacecraft and will operate the mission. IMAP is the fifth mission in NASA’s Solar Terrestrial Probes (STP) Program portfolio. The Explorers and Heliophysics Projects Division at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland manages the STP Program for the agency’s Heliophysics Division of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.

The public can watch the spacecraft come together in real-time via a live feed from APL’s clean room which is now available to watch at any time on the IMAP mission website. Viewers can watch the continuous stream to see exactly how IMAP develops from a bare-bones structure to a complex fully operational spacecraft.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vb2lscHJpY2UuY29tL0VuZXJneS9FbmVyZ3ktR2VuZXJhbC9OZWFyLVJlY29yZC1EaXNjb3VudC1Gb3ItRVUtRXF1aXRpZXMtSXNudC1Fbm91Z2gtRm9yLUludmVzdG9ycy5odG1s0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly9vaWxwcmljZS5jb20vRW5lcmd5L0VuZXJneS1HZW5lcmFsL05lYXItUmVjb3JkLURpc2NvdW50LUZvci1FVS1FcXVpdGllcy1Jc250LUVub3VnaC1Gb3ItSW52ZXN0b3JzLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Near-Record Discount For EU Equities Isn't Enough For Investors,"Even a near-record discount for European stocks relative to the US isn’t proving enough to entice investors worried about a slowing economy and weakening profits.

After starting the year well ahead of the S&P 500 the Stoxx Europe 600 lost ground from May onward as the buzz around artificial intelligence fired up technology stocks across the Atlantic. Worries about a regional recession have also fueled an exodus from European stock funds and the index is back to underperforming US stocks in dollar terms for the full year.

That’s a frustrating turn of events for equity bulls who were banking on a 35% discount in Europe’s price-to-earnings ratio — almost the lowest on record — to rekindle investor interest. Wall Street strategists say the gap isn’t closing any time soon.

Forecasters from Bank of America to Deutsche Bank expect the S&P 500 to hit a record high in 2024. The outlook for European benchmarks is a lot more timid with earnings expected to rise just 6.7% versus an 11% gain in the US according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.

“We expect European stocks to underperform the US” says Marija Veitmane senior multi-asset strategist at State Street Global Markets. “We are already in a global manufacturing downturn and it’s really weighing on cyclical exporter markets like Europe.” While she agrees European stocks are relatively cheap “unfortunately value tends to underperform in a recession” she says.

Veitmane is not alone. A multi-asset portfolio team at Societe Generale says European stocks are likely to show no gains at all next year amid an economic slowdown. They see the region’s stocks potentially slumping nearly 10% early in the year — a starkly bearish stance compared with the US where they expect the S&P 500 to flirt with its all-time peak.

The gloom has also been reflected in the investor exodus from the region this year. European stock funds had outflows for 37 straight weeks according to a Bank of America note citing EPFR Global. Even Goldman Sachs’s Sharon Bell who expects the Stoxx 600 to rise next year says the main buyers will come from within Europe via corporate buybacks.

Not that the discount doesn’t matter. Part of Bell’s optimism stems from Europe’s “reasonable valuations.” And while JPMorgan’s Mislav Matejka is staying underweight on the euro zone versus the US for now his team say they could potentially change that call through the first half of 2024 “given the increasingly attractive valuations.” Oliver Collin co-head of European equities at Invesco says that “European equities are one of the few equity markets to still be attractively priced relative to bonds.”

But that’s not enough for bears like BofA’s Sebastian Raedler who expects the Stoxx 600 to slide 15% halfway through the year. “We see scope for a meaningful deterioration in growth momentum ahead on the back of a weakening credit cycle” he says.

COR,Cencora,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jZW5jb3JhLW55c2UtY29yLXNoYXJlaG9sZGVycy1lYXJuZWQtMTI1MzM3NDI1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cencora (NYSE:COR) shareholders have earned a 21% CAGR over the last five years,"The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price you can gain well over 100%. One great example is Cencora Inc. (NYSE:COR) which saw its share price drive 142% higher over five years. On top of that the share price is up 17% in about a quarter. This could be related to the recent financial results released recently - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report.

So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.

See our latest analysis for Cencora

To quote Buffett 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.

During the last half decade Cencora became profitable. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain just as we have seen here.

The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).

We know that Cencora has improved its bottom line over the last three years but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling Cencora stock you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.

What About Dividends?

When looking at investment returns it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens Cencora's TSR for the last 5 years was 161% which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!

A Different Perspective

It's good to see that Cencora has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 19% in the last twelve months. Of course that includes the dividend. However the TSR over five years coming in at 21% per year is even more impressive. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight we need to consider other information too. Take risks for example - Cencora has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.

This week Cencora announced its newly-launched AB Marketplace powered by Mirakl a one-stop shop for independent pharmacies to efficiently source front of store and prescription orders. Built and launched in just six months with the Mirakl Marketplace Platform and Mirakl Payout AB Marketplace expands the company’s existing ABC Order eCommerce platform adding thousands of new products to an eCommerce experience already used and loved by the company’s B2B buyers. Jay Dombi Cencora’s SVP of Strategic Solutions shared:

“Selecting the Mirakl Marketplace Platform and Mirakl Payout was an easy choice – their technology enables us to maintain the seamless experience our buyers and suppliers expect and aligned with the needs across our business technology and innovation teams.”

4 Benefits of Cencora’s B2B eCommerce Marketplace

Dombi took the stage with Mirakl CEO Adrien Nussenbaum at Mirakl’s 2023 Platform Pioneer Summit in Chicago to unpack the ins and outs of Cencora’s marketplace strategy and how it’s delivering value to both the company’s customers and third-party partners.

1. Simplified logistics

Pharmaceutical wholesalers like AmerisourceBergen contend with a range of regulations and compliance measures. A marketplace solution makes it possible to offer more products to buyers without compromising existing approaches to logistics.

“There are other things sold in pharmacies that we don’t want in our distribution centers whether it’s a Snickers bar or some of the large bulky medical equipment” said Dombi. “For us it was about ensuring we could meet our customers’ needs while also easing the overall procurement process.”

Cencora SVP of Strategic Solutions Jay Dombi explains why Cencora launched a marketplace.

2. Customer convenience

Above all a B2B marketplace is about improving the customer experience. AmerisourceBergen customers spend nearly $1 billion per day on the company’s eCommerce platform; introducing a marketplace model will allow these customers to address more of their needs in a one-stop experience.

“We have the eyes of these customers” said Dombi. “It becomes a natural opportunity for our partners to provide the rest of their assortment catalog and make it readily available to our customers.”

3. Partner potential

For AmerisourceBergen’s marketplace sellers the platform approach allows them to grow alongside one of the world’s largest companies.

“There’s a lot of excitement and interest particularly from our existing first-party suppliers” said Dombi. “It’s opened up a lot of opportunity in terms of new suppliers looking at how we can service these customers mutually grow our businesses together and ultimately see success.”

4. Straightforward payouts

Partnering with an industry leader like AmerisourceBergen can be complicated for smaller suppliers. An efficient marketplace payout tool is essential to streamline onboarding and manage the seller relationship. Dombi appreciated the simplicity and flexibility of Mirakl Payout which can be tailored to the requirements of each marketplace operator. “The team has been wonderful in adapting to some of our needs” said Dombi.

Jay Dombi explains why Cencora is using Mirakl Payout.

Limitless Opportunities for B2B Marketplace Expansion

What’s next for a pharmaceutical supplier that’s already one of the country’s largest companies? Anything is possible with a digital marketplace. Dombi sees opportunities in expanding into new geographies different health systems and even adjacent industries like animal health. “We will grow through all those areas and we’ll hopefully eventually have opportunities to service all of our customers through a marketplace in various ways” said Dombi.

December 01 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--CF Industries Holdings Inc. (NYSE: CF) today announced that it has closed its acquisition of Incitec Pivot Limited’s (""IPL"") ammonia production complex located in Waggaman Louisiana.

Under the terms of the agreement CF Industries purchased the Waggaman ammonia plant and related assets for $1.675 billion subject to adjustments. The companies allocated approximately $425 million of the purchase price to a long-term ammonia offtake agreement under which CF Industries will supply up to 200000 tons of ammonia per year to IPL’s Dyno Nobel subsidiary at production economics. CF Industries funded the remaining purchase price with cash on hand.

""We are pleased to grow our industry-leading ammonia production capabilities with the addition of IPL’s Waggaman ammonia production facility and team"" said Tony Will president and chief executive officer CF Industries Holdings Inc. ""This transaction deploys our capital efficiently delivering immediate profitable growth by adding one of the newest ammonia production units in North America into our existing network while advancing our long-term strategic focus on low-carbon ammonia as a clean energy source.""

Along with its offtake agreement with IPL CF Industries will continue to fulfill medium- and long-term offtake agreements with two customers that were in-place prior to the acquisition. The Company estimates that these agreements will generate gross margin per ton commensurate with its existing ammonia segment prior to the greater capacity utilization and operational and logistics optimization CF Industries expects to achieve with the site’s integration into the Company. Additionally CF Industries anticipates implementing carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies at the site on an accelerated timeline increasing its network’s low-carbon ammonia production capability while earning 45Q tax credits for sequestered carbon dioxide.

Credit: Andrzej Rostek via Shutterstock.

The mining industry was the main driver behind slight growth in total new capital expenditure (capex) in Australia official figures show.

Capex in mining was up 5.6 points in the third quarter (Q3) of 2023 offsetting a 1.3% fall in non-mining industries the Australian Bureau of Statistics said.

Overall capex rose by 0.6% in Q3 2023 to be 10.7% higher than a year ago.

Robert Ewing ABS head of business statistics said an increase of 5.4% in building and structures investments was driven by mining.

He said: “This industry raised its spending on iron-ore projects and battery-related mineral developments. It was offset by a fall in non-mining industries down 2.2%.

“The construction industry was the largest contributor to the rise in equipment and machinery capex. It grew by 15% as supply chain disruptions continued to ease. This allowed businesses to take delivery of new vehicles and heavy machinery.”

Western Australia (WA) had the largest rise of the states and territories increasing 7.5% in Q3. This was offset by a large fall in Queensland down 10.8% following large rises in Q1 and Q2.

Ewing said that new capex by states has been “very mixed” over the past 12 months with WA and Victoria out in front with growth of 24% and 20.1% respectively.

“Growth in Western Australia was dominated by the mining industry while growth in Victoria reflects a continuing recovery from steep declines during the pandemic” Ewing said.

Overall businesses revised up their capex expectations by 8.5% in current prices since the previous estimate three months ago.

We start with an update and details about the F-14 Tomcat by Indiafoxtecho and Heatblur which is still undergoing final testing and the certification process at Microsoft. It won't be released this week despite some speculation to that effect.

The best-case scenario is a release on December 7 but the developers can't promise that as it will depend on test results.

The final price will have some variance due to different countries' VAT but the current estimate is $34.99 + VAT.

We also learn that it'll be available on the official in-sim marketplace on Heatblur's store SimMarket Orbx and possibly other stores.

The developers are still waiting for Xbox test results to confirm availability and release on consoles. In the best-case scenario it'll launch on Xbox at the same time as the PC version but this has not been promised.

Next is an update on the Fokker F100 and F70 from Just Flight. Significant improvements have been made to the modeling and textures of both the interior and exterior on top of the coding of the systems. It'll include the following variants.

However Schwab’s stock price is down about 35% year to date and its earnings and revenue were significantly lower than they were in the same quarter a year ago. Will Schwab bounce back or is this a stock to avoid? Let’s take a deeper dive.

An improving deposit picture

While Schwab beat earnings estimates its revenue and net income totals were down precipitously from the same period a year ago. Schwab posted $4.6 billion in revenue for the quarter down 16% while its adjusted net income excluding restructuring and acquisition costs dropped 30% to $1.5 billion or $0.77 per share.

There were a few major reasons for the drop starting with net interest income (NII). As Schwab also has a banking arm it saw a 29% drop in NII due to significantly higher interest paid out on deposits due to the higher interest rates. Additionally deposit balances were down 31% to $291 billion and this drawdown on deposits has been a concern.

The decrease in deposits has contributed to higher net interest expenses as some customers moved their money to higher interest-generating accounts like money markets. It also reduces the amount of capital Schwab can use to invest in other higher interest-earnings products. Both issues result in a drag on earnings.

However it appears that one of the catalysts for Schwab’s post-earnings spike was an improving deposit scenario. Bank deposits were only down 7% from the second quarter which is far less than the year-over-year decline. It was buoyed by an increase in bank sweep deposits which are unused cash from brokerage accounts that are swept into deposit accounts. Schwab recorded increasing bank sweep deposits for the first time since March 2022.

The firm also received a boost from its asset management business as the rising stock market lifted its asset management fees by some 17% year over year to $1.2 billion. In addition it gained $46 billion in net new client assets in the quarter including $27 billion in September alone.

“Year to date we have attracted $248 billion of core net new assets from accounts originally opened at Schwab — an annualized Schwab-originated organic growth rate of over 6%. As of Sept. 30 investors have entrusted us with a total of $7.82 trillion in client assets across 34.5 million accounts” Co-chair and CEO Walt Bettinger said.

Some positive momentum

It has been a difficult year for Schwab but investors were no doubt pleasantly surprised by the positive momentum and growth the company exhibited with its deposits and new client acquisitions. However Schwab should also stand to benefit from the integration of the TD Ameritrade business which it acquired a couple of years ago.

Over Labor Day weekend Schwab systems were hard at work transitioning $1.3 trillion in client assets from TD Ameritrade to the Schwab brokerage platform. This included some 7000 registered investment advisors (RIA) and 3.6 million retail accounts. Schwab has now shifted 80% of TD Ameritrade assets and accounts to its platform.

Once fully integrated next year the firm expects to realize $1 billion in annual expense savings through increased efficiencies and streamlined operations while providing added scale for one of the nation’s largest brokerage firms. We’re seeing the integration benefits already as Schwab announced this week that its combined Think or Swim advanced trading platform is now available to traders.

As mentioned earlier Schwab has struggled this year with its stock down by about 35% and it has averaged an 8.4% annualized return over the past 10 years as of Oct. 17. Both numbers trail the S&P 500 in those respective periods.

However the stock is reasonably valued with a price-to-earnings ratio of 15 down from 23 a year ago at this time. Further it has a forward P/E ratio of 13.

Thus while Schwab has faced some headwinds with the TD Ameritrade integration near completion interest rates plateauing and a recession looking less likely than many experts previously expected it’s in a great position as the market’s dominant player to bounce back.

Video Transcript

SEANA SMITH: Liz Ann I think a lot of investors out there are trying to figure out exactly the best ways to play this market given the uncertainty around the Fed given the fact that we obviously don't know when exactly the rate cuts are going to start. We've seen some excitement. When you take a look at some of those [? beaten ?] down names like the Russell 2000 and the small-caps over the last several weeks are you seeing some tailwind there as we look ahead to 2024? And where else are you seeing those best opportunities?

LIZ ANN SONDERS: It is interesting. Because over the past month the Russell 2000 is actually outperforming the S&P 500. And I think that that is indicative of some money that is looking to move into areas other than just the Magnificent 7 in the interest of seeing a broadening out.

However within that I think you want to fade to use trader lingo the lower quality names that have done well but continue to lean in up the quality spectrum. And one thing that's interesting about the Russell 2000 as an index it's the most common small-cap benchmark that's used. But there's also the S&P 600 as an index.

The only reason why I mention those two is that Russell doesn't use a profitability filter. There's close to 40% of stocks in that index that are not profitable. 31% of stocks in that index are zombie companies versus the S&P 600 that has a profitability filter.

And as a result it's trading at a multiple about I don't know eight or nine points lower than the Russell 2000. So I'm not recommending the index. But if you're looking for an index as a source for ideas inherently you have a higher quality index with the S&P 600 because of that profitability filter.

Story continues

BRAD SMITH: Liz Ann just lastly while we have you here we're in the holiday spirit. I mean we're getting close to the end of the year. We're trying to put together some New Year's resolutions. Mine is to just say [? serenity ?] now just a little bit less next year. And for that I need a top idea. What is your top idea of kind of getting into 2024?

LIZ ANN SONDERS: Discipline. I think this is the time for discipline risk management. And it's about diversification and rebalancing. That's the best way to navigate through an uncertain environment.

BRAD SMITH: Liz Ann Sonders Charles Schwab chief investment strategist great to have you here this morning.

LIZ ANN SONDERS: Good to see you.

BRAD SMITH: We appreciate the time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5ibG9vbWJlcmdsYXcuY29tL2luLWhvdXNlLWNvdW5zZWwvbW9yZS1qb2ItYWRzLWluY2x1ZGUtcGF5LXJhbmdlcy1idXQtY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1tdW0tb24tc2NvZmZsYXdz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,More Job Ads Include Pay Ranges But California Mum on Scofflaws,"Employers have largely embraced a 2022 California law that requires disclosure for job salaries for open positions but there remains a lack of compliance along with questions over enforcement.

About 70% of California job postings on the website Indeed included salary information as of this summer up from about 33% just one year earlier before the law took effect Jan. 1 the company says. While the pay transparency trend has been most pronounced in California it is also reflected in job listings around the country as larger employers embrace pay transparency policies to navigate what has become a patchwork of rules across the six states that have passed such laws. Still the trend is most pronounced in the Golden State.

More than half of all job openings on Indeed now include salaries according to the company.

Still it is common to see job advertisements in California that don’t include salary information and regulators appear to have less of a priority in enforcing the new rules compared to pursuing other labor violations such as large wage theft cases.

Backers contend such laws can help combat pay inequity by providing a measure of fairness for job applicants bringing information about employment practices into the open and challenging yet another convention of the pre-Covid workplace.

State Senator Monique Limón (D) who authored the California law said she still wants to expand pay transparency but argued that proof the policy is working can be found in job listings.

“The impact of this legislation is evidenced in the increase in salary ranges that are popping up in almost every sector in multiple states giving employees and employers an opportunity to negotiate salaries” she said.

New Laws Tight Market

When Colorado legislators passed the first such pay transparency law in the country which went into effect in 2021 some employers pushed back by excluding applicants from Colorado. Regulators there have also cracked down on companies by levying fines including big brands such as Tesla Inc. and Charles Schwab Corp .

But as other states have passed similar laws including New York Washington Illinois and California employers do not seem to be avoiding pay transparency requirements in the same way as when Colorado’s law first went into effect said Helena Almeida vice president and managing counsel at the payroll processing firm ADP.

That reflects not just a growing number of states passing pay transparency laws but also a labor market where workers are increasingly expecting employers to disclose salary information.

“We have the legal push and we have employees who are expecting more transparency” she said.

Laws vary by state but California’s measure (S.B. 1162) requires any employer with more than 15 employees to include a pay range in job advertisements. The law expanded on an existing state requirement that employers provide the pay range for a job at the request of an applicant.

The state labor commissioner is tasked with investigating complaints about violations of the law and has the power to mete out civil penalties of up to $10000 per infraction.

But those searching LinkedIn for jobs in the Sacramento area where the commissioner’s office is headquartered can find plenty of postings that do not include a salary range and job boards don’t tend to require such information.

While clearly advertised pay grades have long been common practice in the public sector the law marked a bigger shift for the private sector.

A casual search for job postings potentially violating state law turns up listings. They include a midsize regional accounting firm; a company that provides environmental site assessments; and a firm that handles hazardous waste inspections for government agencies.

The California Department of Industrial Relations which includes the labor commissioner’s office did not provide information about the number of complaints it has received under the new law nor how many violators it has fined.

While it may also be too soon to determine if the California law is succeeding in narrowing wage inequality Almeida said the measure and similar state legislation has at least given job applicants more leverage.

“There’s these different things that change who has the power” she said."

Network Buildout is Part of Spectrum’s $5 Billion Multiyear Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) Investment in Rural Broadband

CASS COUNTY Mo. — Spectrum the #1 rural internet provider in the nation* today announced the launch of Spectrum Internet Mobile TV and Voice services to more than 600 additional homes and small businesses near the communities of Harrisonville and Pleasant Hill plus other parts of rural Cass County Missouri. Spectrum’s newly constructed fiber-optic network buildout in Cass County is part of the company’s approximately $5 billion RDOF-related investment in unserved rural communities partly offset by $1.2 billion in the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) RDOF auction.

The company’s RDOF expansion will provide broadband access to approximately 1 million customer locations as estimated by the FCC across 24 states in the coming years. Spectrum has also won more than $700 million in state broadband expansion subsidies which combined with Spectrum investment will connect another 300000 homes and small businesses.

“Spectrum is bringing gigabit broadband to unserved communities in Missouri and across America through RDOF” said Matt Brown Vice President of Construction. “Our investment is making it possible to deliver the high-value broadband mobile TV and voice services now available in more parts of rural Cass County. We are providing local residents and small businesses superior connectivity at highly competitive prices backed by a team of skilled local technicians and 100% U.S.-based customer service.”

Broadband Speeds up to 1 Gbps Plus Money-Saving Mobile Options and 85000 On Demand Choices

Spectrum Internet delivers speeds up to 1 Gbps and Advanced WiFi for residential and small business customers featuring starting speeds of 300 Mbps with no modem fees data caps or contracts. Spectrum Business Internet offers customers 1 Gbps download speeds with 300 Mbps and 600 Mbps options. The company has also begun a network evolution that will provide gigabit upstream speeds and multiple gigabit download speeds across its entire 41-state service area.

Spectrum Internet exceeded advertised download and upload speeds for all tiers measured — even during peak weeknight usage between 7 and 11 p.m. — according to the FCC’s most recent “Measuring Broadband America Fixed Broadband Report” issued in January 2023.

“Ensuring all constituents in Missouri’s 4th Congressional District have access to reliable fast and affordable internet has been one of my top priorities” said Rep. Mark Alford. “Charter’s recent RDOF expansion helps close the remaining access gaps and brings internet accessibility to more families and businesses in Cass County. Not only will I continue to support private efforts to increase internet access but I will continue to diligently push for solutions at the Congressional level.”

Spectrum also was a day one participant in the Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP) which makes quality high-speed internet service available at a low — or even at no — cost to eligible families in financial need. All Spectrum Internet plans are eligible for ACP credits and because customers are not locked into a contract families can always choose the right broadband plan to meet their changing needs.

“In today’s modern economy businesses and their employees need a reliable internet connection both at home and in the office” said State Rep. Mike Haffner. “That is why Spectrum’s high-speed internet expansion through the RDOF program is welcomed news for Cass County residents and businesses that are looking to grow and offer flexibility.”

Along with multiple broadband options Spectrum services now available also include Spectrum Mobile™ and Spectrum TV®. Spectrum Mobile is the nation’s fastest-growing mobile provider** and combines with Spectrum Internet and Advanced Home WiFi to provide seamless connectivity inside and outside the home. Spectrum Mobile provides customers access to nationwide 5G at great value with Unlimited lines starting at $29.99 a month as well as By the Gig options.

“It’s disappointing but certainly not surprising that TEGNA is just the latest to perpetuate what’s become the status quo for American broadcasters by using its territorial exclusivities and blackouts to extort ever-increasing rates for programming that remains free over-the-air” said Rob Thun chief content officer of DIRECTV in a prepared statement. “We just can’t do this anymore–these price increases are unsustainable for the average consumer. It’s a badly broken model that erodes trust eliminates choice and keeps delving deeper into the wallets of our already overtaxed customers.”

TV services have been battered in recent years by cord cutting as people turn to other means – primarily streaming – to get their entertainment shows.

In 2016 DirecTV had more than 21 million customers. Not including DirecTV Stream and U-Verse that number is down to approximately 12 million as of this past August. The service lost 750000 viewers alone in the first half of this year according to reports.

When might there be movement between the parties?

Customers might want to dig in for the long haul. DirecTV’s dispute with Nexstar which owns Fox 8 (WJW Channel 8) lasted most of the summer and wasn’t resolved until after the football season began.

Where does this leave consumers?

For those looking for NBC programming locally WKYC can be viewed on NBC's streaming app Peacock or depending on location and the television owned picking the station up over-the-air is entirely reasonable.

The field is estimated to hold 4.2 trillion cubic feet of gas.

The agreement is “mutually beneficial"" for both Cyprus and the company the Cypriot official told The Associated Press but did not disclose further details.

It was not immediately clear when the deal was reached. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the agreement publicly.

The Cypriot energy ministry said in a statement Friday a letter from Chevron affirmed that both sides are in “alignment” regarding the “wider framework of the field's exploitation.” The ministry added that they would “intensify discussions” in the coming weeks on the agreed-upon development plan “for the mutually beneficial exploitation” of the site.

Chevron wanted to send the gas to Egypt through a pipeline but Cyprus preferred to process it on a floating production facility because it would be more economically beneficial for the Cypriot government and would lend more flexibility to supplying other markets.

The agreement ends protracted negotiations that stalled development of the field for years and now paves the way for extraction of the hydrocarbon after a dozen years since the deposit was discovered.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAxL29jY2lkZW50YWwtcGV0cm9sZXVtLWNvdWxkLXNvb24tZm9sbG93LWV4eG9uLWFuZC1jL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Occidental Petroleum Could Soon Follow Exxon and Chevron by Making a Needle-Moving Acquisition,"Occidental Petroleum could make a needle-moving deal.

Occidental Petroleum (OXY 0.12%) could be nearing a deal to buy privately held oil producer CrownRock. The Wall Street Journal reported that the oil giant was in the lead to buy the Permian Basin producer. The deal could be worth more than $10 billion.

The potential deal would be the latest in a wave of merger activity in the oil patch. ExxonMobil (XOM -0.07%) and Chevron (CVX -0.48%) closed multibillion-dollar acquisitions this year and have since agreed to even larger transactions. That's spurring rivals to consider deals of their own to keep up with those energy giants.

In the lead to buy a prized producer

Occidental is one of several oil companies linked to CrownRock in recent weeks. Reuters reported last month that ConocoPhillips was weighing an offer for CrownRock. Meanwhile Devon Energy Diamondback Energy Marathon Oil and Continental Resources have all looked into buying CrownRock. Given the intense interest talks with Occidental might not lead to a deal if one of those rivals or another suitor swoops in at the last moment.

The big draw with CrownRock is its sizable position in the Permian Basin. The company owns more than 80000 acres in the northern part of the Midland Basin. It currently produces about 150000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) from that position. Buying CrownRock would enable the acquirer to meaningfully increase their scale in the resource-rich Permian. That would allow them to spread costs over a larger position increasing their profit margin.

Occidental is already one of the largest players in the Permian. The company holds 2.8 million acres. Overall it produces 588000 BOE/d from its position in the Permian. Acquiring CrownRock would enable Occidental to further increase its scale in the region and leverage its existing position to reduce costs.

Getting bigger and better

Scale has been the main driver of the current wave of mergers in the oil patch. Exxon is paying over $60 billion to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources to boost its scale in the Permian. The deal will more than double Exxon's acreage position in the region (adding 850000 net acres to its existing 570000 net-acre position). It will also more than double its Permian production to a combined 1.3 million BOE/d. Exxon believes its enhanced scale will enable it to earn double-digit returns as it recovers more resources more efficiently.

Scale also drove Chevron's $7.6 billion deal for PDC Energy. It significantly enhanced Chevron's position in the DJ Basin where it added 275000 net acres. Meanwhile it added 25000 acres to its position in the Permian. That increased scale drives Chevron's expectation it will capture about $100 million in cost savings while adding about $1 billion in annual free cash flow. Meanwhile the company's $60 billion deal for Hess should enable it to capture around $1 billion in cost savings.

An acquisition of CrownRock could enable its acquirer to achieve meaningful cost savings by streamlining development plans leveraging existing infrastructure and spreading costs over a larger position. That's why so many oil companies are interested in CrownRock.

Only one oil company will emerge victorious in the bidding for CrownRock. That will likely lead its other suitors to look elsewhere for a needle-moving deal. Some could seek to join forces -- Devon and Marathon have reportedly held merger talks -- while others will likely look at another private producer potentially circling back to see if Endeavor Energy Resources is now ready to sell.

The next wave is about to hit

Occidental Petroleum is reportedly in the lead to acquire CrownRock. A potential tie-up between the two would enhance Occidental's already strong position in the Permian further increasing its scale. The conclusion of that auction process would likely lead other suitors to look elsewhere for a deal so that they don't lose out on the opportunity to participate in what's becoming a major consolidation wave in the sector.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vY2FyYm9udHJhY2tlci5vcmcvcmVwb3J0cy9jaGV2cm9uLWV4eG9ubW9iaWwtYW5kLW94eS1tYS1hbmQtdGhlLWVuZXJneS10cmFuc2l0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chevron ExxonMobil and Oxy: M&A and the Energy Transition,"In this note Neil Quach Senior Corporate Research Analyst – North American Oil & Gas drills down into the financial and economic implications of recent moves by North American oil and gas companies.

Carbon Tracker has examined corporate alignment with climate targets transition risk incentives and corporate climate targets in other work. In this piece we focus on the economic and financial dimensions of three recent developments in the North American oil and gas space: (1) lithium extraction (2) carbon dioxide removal (CDR)/carbon capture & storage (CCS); and (3) large scale consolidation activity.

Two companies that appear to be ahead of the group in terms of these ET activities are: Occidental Petroleum (in CDR/CCS) and ExxonMobil (in CDR/CCS & lithium extraction).

The US IRA (Inflation Reduction Act of 2022) and the relentless drive toward electrification of the global passenger car fleet provide support for potentially strong returns in lithium & in CDR/CCS. While some engineering challenges remain our preliminary analysis suggests that returns for these ET businesses are very competitive with traditional oil & gas activities given the tax incentives available.

Lithium in particular could see strong tailwinds with double digit demand growth far surpassing that of oil & gas. Lithium is a cornerstone of the ET benefitting from both economics and the decarbonization impulse.

The $85/ton section 45Q IRA tax credit could generate a strong return profile for point source CCS project partners.

Though low-carbon investments remain a fraction of their overall investments we are seeing a rising rate of change in ET activities with these businesses potentially becoming a meaningful part of company portfolios in the medium term.

Also there’s large scale consolidation in the traditional oil & gas space epitomized by: (1) ExxonMobil’s $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer a Permian pure play and (2) Chevron $53 billion acquisition of Hess whose core assets are long cycle offshore Guyana Stabroek Block.

From a risk-weighted economic and financial standpoint we believe short cycle shale is less risky than long cycle conventional oil & gas developments in a declining hydrocarbon demand scenario as shale has a lower risk of becoming stranded.

We also note the importance of being the low-cost producer in the energy transition as we have stated here and here with larger oil & gas fields generally having a lower cost.

Longer term we expect industry consolidation could lead to a more limited pace of oil & gas development since there’s a tendency toward supply restraint in concentrated industries.

The company's Chairman and CEO Brian Niccol sold 1093 shares of the company on December 1 2023. This transaction has prompted a closer look into the insider activities and the potential implications for the stock's performance.

Who is Brian Niccol?

Brian Niccol has been at the helm of Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc as the Chairman and CEO steering the company through a period of significant growth and transformation. Niccol joined Chipotle in 2018 bringing with him a wealth of experience from his previous roles including President at Taco Bell a division of Yum! Brands. Under his leadership Chipotle has embraced digital innovation expanded its menu and improved its operational efficiency all of which have contributed to the company's robust financial performance and elevated market position.

Analysis of Insider Buy/Sell and Relationship with Stock Price

Insider transactions can provide valuable insights into a company's health and future prospects. Over the past year Brian Niccol has sold a total of 20960 shares and has not made any purchases. This pattern of insider selling with 31 insider sells and no insider buys over the same timeframe could be interpreted in various ways. While some may view this as a lack of confidence in the company's future growth it is also common for executives to sell shares for personal financial planning or diversification purposes.

On the day of the insider's recent sell shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc were trading at $2199.81 giving the company a substantial market cap of $61.31 billion. The price-earnings ratio stands at 52.98 which is above the industry median of 23.12 but below the company's historical median. This indicates that while the stock is trading at a premium compared to the industry it is relatively in line with its own historical valuation.

Story continues

The relationship between insider selling and stock price is not always straightforward. However in the case of Chipotle the stock's valuation seems to be holding steady despite the insider sells. With a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.04 the stock is considered Fairly Valued based on its GF Value. This suggests that the market has already priced in the company's growth prospects and current financial metrics.

Reverend Bill Lawson a civil rights icon and the founder of Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church in Third Ward died Tuesday morning at the age of 95.

HOUSTON Texas (KTRK) -- Reverend William A. Lawson a civil rights icon who was also known as Houston's pastor and the founder of Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church died Tuesday morning at the age of 95.

Rev. Lawson was a father of four including ABC13's Melanie Lawson but generations of Houstonians knew him as a preacher and as a trailblazer for equality.

Over the course of seven decades Rev. Lawson helped shape Houston into what it is today coming here from Kansas City in 1955 to work at Texas Southern University.

""I would love to say that I marched heroically into the civil rights movement but that wasn't the way it was at all"" Rev. Lawson said.

From TSU he helped found Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church in Third Ward. It started with 13 members in 1962.

A humble man with a soft voice he was not the kind to shout or wave a fist calling for change. It was his wife Audrey who encouraged him.

""'Honey you cannot have a church with just preaching and singing. You're going to have to reach out into the neighborhood and somehow be involved with the problems of people in the neighborhoods.' So I thought of this new church as being a church that was going to be both religion and social movement"" Rev. Lawson said.

He and Audrey were married for 61 years when she died in 2015.

They had four children together -- a son Eric and three daughters: Cheryl Roxanne and Melanie.

The children grew up in a house that saw visits from other civil rights icons including Martin Luther King Junior who tried to recruit Lawson to come to Atlanta.

He declined choosing to collaborate with King and others from here in his adopted hometown where he was building his church.

""I chose to stay here because of the people who had started out as 13 and who by the time were probably several hundred"" Rev. Lawson previously told ABC13.

That church now has more than 12000 members today.

It's a testament to the lasting legacy of Bill Lawson the soft-spoken giant of a man who led Houston through tumultuous change with grace and humility.

""If the young people I can leave behind are people who likewise will have something to believe in and something that is going to drive them to do what is best for the underclass that is what I'd like to pass on"" Rev. Lawson said.

In a revelation that appeared to some as almost as unusual as his announcement of the suicide of his wife Mica Miller Pastor John-Paul Miller of Solid Rock at Market Common in Myrtle Beach South Carolina said he tried to raise her from the dead but it didn’t work.

The grieving pastor made the revelation as he eulogized his late wife during a May 5 memorial service at the church.

“As Christians of course we know she’s not here. [She’s] in Heaven worshiping and enjoying and probably haven’t [sic] had time to look down here yet” Miller said in a 35-minute recording of the service posted by the church on YouTube over the weekend.

“But I’ve been down to the body about four times this week and each time it still didn’t hit me [that she was gone]” Miller said. “I thought she was gonna wake up. I even tried to raise her from the dead one time this week.”

Miller then explained that he genuinely thought he had raised his wife from the dead at one point but the person he thought was Mica was her sister.

“I went to the mall. … She [Mica] had bought me this dog tag. The chain broke so I went to the mall to get it fixed. And I saw a female about 20-30 feet in front of me. And she was wearing one of Mica’s dresses and she has the same tattoo Mica has on her arm and the exact same hair and out of just instinct I screamed Mica!” he said. “The girl turned around; it was one of her sisters. And I thought I raised her from the dead. She’s alive you know. But I can’t wait to see her one day.”

Pastor Miller’s mentor and spiritual advisor the Rev. Charles Randall recently announced to congregants at Solid Rock at Market Common that Miller had been relieved of all ministerial duties ""for a time of healing counsel and guidance pursuant to our governing instrument.” Randall told The Christian Post that he has no plans to permanently remove Miller from the pulpit because God has not told him to do so.

Despite allegations against Miller painting him as an abusive manipulative church leader whose lifestyle disqualifies him as a pastor Randall insists that Miller will remain pastor of the church until he hears from God that he should be removed and God hasn’t told him to remove him yet.

And this would not be Pastor Miller’s first time weathering a scandal.

In a 2017 affidavit highlighted by the Daily Mail Miller’s first wife Alison who's the mother of his five children accused him of engaging in sex acts with minors younger than 16 and having an addiction to prostitutes. She also alleged that Miller was caught in an affair with Mica in 2015 while she was working as their babysitter and married to his then-best friend Jeremy Deas.

“Our marriage and my husband’s career were less than stable at the time because at the time my husband’s affair was discovered he had previously admitted to both me and our congregation that he had an addiction to prostitution” Alison wrote in the affidavit seeking alimony.

“He had also confessed to me and other staff members of the church that he had sexual encounters with young females from the church who were under the age of sixteen” she added.

Instead of removing Miller as leader Alison stated that church officials demanded he get counseling for his sex addiction but he refused to get counseling which caused many of the members to leave.

“When he refused the majority of our church left the congregation” Alison wrote.

Miller previously acknowledged the affair with Mica and being forced to start over at his church in an interview with CP but he did not share the details alleged by Alison.

In one of the latest allegations against the pastor according to News Nation Miller confessed to posting a nude photo of his late wife on social media as she tried to divorce him.

“I’m sorry for putting a picture of you on the internet” he said in an apology email cited by the news outlet. “It was for less than one hour and immediately taken down. I was hurt that you are telling everyone horrible intimate details of my past sin and I just wanted to try and hurt you. Please forgive me. It was evil of me to do that.”

When asked about the allegation the office of Pastor Miller’s attorney Russell B. Long said he had no comment.

Court records cited by The New York Post show that Mica Miller filed for divorce from her husband in October 2023 but the reasons were not stated. The case was eventually dismissed in February but a few days later Pastor Miller filed for “Separate Support and Maintenance” seeking financial support. Mica Miller would file for similar support in April. A hearing was scheduled for June 5. On April 27 two days after she served Miller with divorce papers Mica Miller was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to her head in Lumber River State Park in Orrum North Carolina.

Miller told CP that shortly after he and Mica got married in 2017 she was diagnosed with “bipolar II schizophrenic and dependent personality disorder.”

Since then he says they have been trying to manage her mental illness with lithium and significant support. As long as she took her medication Miller said his wife would be fine. Mica however had a roller coaster relationship with the medication.

He alleged she would complain how the medication would make her gain weight or cause her to slur. And earlier this year the wife of a well-meaning pastor friend who had no understanding of mental illness offered to pray and believe that Mica Miller’s mental illness would go away. That incident he said stuck with Mica and she started to believe that she no longer needed the medication.

Miller did not reveal that he too had mental health struggles and had also been medicated.

A dated video posted on Facebook by Ty Longerbeam on May 10 shows Miller experiencing what some claim appears to be drug-induced psychosis. He explains in the video to an unidentified person that his medication was changed and he felt like ants were crawling all over him even though no ants were visible crawling over him.

In the video Miller is laying on a lawn next to a truck with an open door mumbling almost incoherently. Neighbors offer him water and try to comfort him while gently trying to figure out the best way to help him.

When asked if he wanted his mother to come help he said “I don’t want my mom” because she is always trying to get him on medication and “this is what it does.”

“I can’t eat I can’t sleep I can’t do nothing” he said.

Longerbeam did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CP. But in commentary he shared with the video he said he wanted to show that Miller also struggled with his mental health.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR3LmNvbS9lbi90YXlsb3Itc3dpZnQtc2VydmljZS1maWxscy1nZXJtYW4tY2h1cmNoL2EtNjkwNTg2ODjSAUlodHRwczovL2FtcC5kdy5jb20vZW4vdGF5bG9yLXN3aWZ0LXNlcnZpY2UtZmlsbHMtZ2VybWFuLWNodXJjaC9hLTY5MDU4Njg4?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taylor Swift service fills German church,"A 600-year-old church in southern Germany may not be the place one would expect to hear Taylor Swift songs but that is what happened Sunday. Some 1200 people attended the unexpectedly emotional gathering.

Heidelberg's famous Church of the Holy Spirit a 600-year-old edifice in the town's historic city center was the scene of an unusual religious service on Sunday where some 1200 congregants came together to pray and contemplate (and enjoy) a performance of US pop star Taylor Swift's songs as part of a special liturgy.

Staged under the name ""Anti-Hero — Taylor Swift Church Service"" organizers at the Protestant church said the event was conceived to attract younger people as well as to focus on the profound religious convictions expressed in many of Swift's songs.

Swift — who was not at the service but rather on her latest European tour — was raised in the American ""Bible Belt"" and has never hidden her Christian beliefs often integrating these into her music.

This was what inspired church organizers. ""The Church of the Holy Spirit has always been a place of encounter and exchange. That's why a pop-music religious service fits so perfectly"" said Heidelberg Pastor Christof Ellsiepen. ""With it we are giving space to the questions and issues that occupy the younger generation.""

A contemplation of the gospel according to Tay-Tay

Though the idea might suggest a wild concert atmosphere it was largely one of quiet devotion.

Parish Pastor Vincenzo Petracca quoted numerous lyrics and traced Swift's biography emphasizing her attachment to and understanding of Christianity in everyday life.

Petracca acknowledged that Swift's songs are open to numerous interpretations but highlighted the strong Christian — and political — messages she integrates into her songs which address the subjects of women's rights racism and gender equality among others.

The pastor noted however that such topics have made Swift the object of criticism in conservative Christian circles especially among Evangelicals in the US who have branded her ""anti-Christian.""

Swift herself has chastised ""hypocritical faith"" that puts dogma before people. The pastor emphasized as well that ""her faith knows doubt and inner-conflict.""

""Theologically speaking she points to the justness of God"" says Petracca adding ""For her faith and action are inseparable.""

A congregation moved to tears and dancing in their pews

Throughout both Sunday services — two were staged in order to accommodate the large number of people who attended — the congregation which was notably younger and and more female than is often the case were treated to live performances of six Swift songs.

These were performed by Tine Weichmann — a singer from Hamburg and now a professor of popular church music in Heidelberg — and her band. Behind them a rainbow-colored sign reading ""Everybody is welcome!""

Tine Weichmann and her band moved churchgoers to tears and had them dancing in their pews during the service Image: Uwe Anspach/dpa/picture aliance

One of the most emotionally stirring moments of the service came when Weichmann and her band performed ""Soon You'll Get Better."" Swift wrote the song for her mother who had been diagnosed with cancer.

The lyrics she penned speak to desperation and the healing powers of medicine — and of prayer: ""Holy orange bottles each night I pray to you / Desperate people find faith so now I pray to Jesus too.""

Pastor Petracca who admitted the Church of the Holy Spirit was ""built for Gregorian liturgical music and not for Taylor Swift"" said of the service ""I stared into beaming faces — and during the song that Taylor wrote for her cancer-stricken mother many had tears in their eyes.""

PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- Philadelphia police are investigating after a vandal spray-painted swastikas and anti-LGBTQ messages around St. John's Lutheran Church in the Mayfair section last week.

Whoever did it also targeted a flag meant to promote inclusivity authorities say.

Members and employees of St. John's Lutheran Church arrived Friday morning to find hateful homophobic messages spray-painted on several walkways outside the church.

Pastor Daniel Eisenberg told Action News in an exclusive interview that the vandal didn't stop there.

""It was shared with me that the progress flag that we have hanging that was not only ripped down but also the same message was spray-painted on it"" he said.

Investigators also reported that what appears to be two swastikas were spray-painted on the pavement outside the church.

The pastor says that while this act of hatred has him rattled the response from the community has given him hope.

""Five or six people showed up with pressure washers and ready to go"" he said. ""And like within 12 hours after these messages of hate were put up they were gone.""

On Monday detectives unveiled surveillance images of the vandal which unfortunately are not very clear.

Now investigators are looking for more surveillance video along the 3100 block of Tyson Avenue from last Thursday night.

In the meantime Eisenberg says he hopes the person who did this realizes that acting on your hatred is never a good idea.

""I wish that whoever did this could see all of us as siblings of God. See us as people worthy of dignity and respect"" he says.

If anyone recognizes the person in the surveillance images or if anyone has information on this case they are urged to contact the police.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDI5LmNvbS9uZXdzL21hbi1iYXJyaWNhZGVkLWluLWNodXJjaC1zdGVlcGxlLWFmdGVyLXBvaW50aW5nLWd1bi1hdC1wb2xpY2Utb2ZmaWNpYWxz0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94MjkuY29tL25ld3MvbWFuLWJhcnJpY2FkZWQtaW4tY2h1cmNoLXN0ZWVwbGUtYWZ0ZXItcG9pbnRpbmctZ3VuLWF0LXBvbGljZS1vZmZpY2lhbHMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man barricaded in church steeple after pointing gun at police: officials,"A church in Kensington has become a scene of fear as a man is said to be barricaded in the steeple.

Earlier this year a federal judge in Washington state unsealed a whistleblower lawsuit I haven’t been able to stop thinking about. The plaintiff was a nurse practitioner named Maxwell Ollivant who worked from 2019 to 2020 for Optum the physician services subsidiary of the health insurance giant UnitedHealthcare as a primary care practitioner. Ollivant’s patients were nursing home residents insured by a UnitedHealth Medicare Advantage plan. In theory his job was to monitor their symptoms proactively enough to keep them from being admitted to the hospital unnecessarily. In practice many of his patients desperately needed hospitalization: One had a stroke and later gastrointestinal bleeding; another needed a blood transfusion. But Optum bosses according to the lawsuit did everything in their power to stop Ollivant and his colleagues from hospitalizing patients suffering from obvious emergent life-threatening conditions instead directing its employed nurse practitioners to see their “mission” as convincing patients to essentially waive their rights to medical treatment by signing do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders or “comfort care” agreements.

On Tuesday the former Cigna executive turned health care whistleblower Wendell Potter broke the news that his former employer was planning a merger with HMO giant Humana which would create an insurance behemoth with nearly $300 billion in revenue in 2023. Both Cigna and Humana have been under fire recently for alleged efforts to deny reimbursement claims for routine and often urgent medical care. A ProPublica/Capitol Forum investigation earlier this year revealed Cigna was using an algorithm called PXDX to illegally issue blanket denials on hundreds of thousands of claims that would have previously been reviewed by physicians (and in all likelihood approved). Similarly Humana has been under congressional scrutiny over its massive “prior authorization” bureaucracy which requires doctors to obtain up-front permission to treat its Medicare Advantage customers at a rate of 2.8 times per patient per year  the second-highest in the business.

At UnitedHealth which employs or contracts exclusively with 90000 physicians and untold thousands of physician assistants and nurse practitioners like Ollivant bosses can skirt the messiness of prior authorization and denial and the attendant litigation and regulatory scrutiny involved by simply pressuring its clinical workforce to deny care out of the gate. Such are the perks of “vertical integration” through which the country’s largest insurer has turned itself into a one-stop walled garden for health care and increasingly for its denial.

It’s a brilliant business model . UnitedHealth is now the fifth-biggest company in America by revenue with operating income approaching $25 billion and a market capitalization of a half-trillion dollars largely on the strong growth of its Optum medical empire and the one-stop shop for Medicare Advantage patients they serve. And it’s also pretty obviously what Cigna and Humana are hoping to replicate with their merger so long as antitrust authorities don’t get in the way. The two companies are likely betting that whatever resistance Biden’s DOJ exercises to the deal will be undone by a future Trump administration.

THE LAST TIME CIGNA AND HUMANA ATTEMPTED to pull off insurance mega-mergers eight years ago it wasn’t with each other. Cigna proposed to merge with Anthem and Humana with Aetna. In response the Obama Justice Department leaned on UnitedHealth to hand over a large trove of competitive information  which it deployed to successfully argue that the mergers would stifle competition and cause premiums to rise. The mergers were successfully blocked.

In the aftermath Cigna and Aetna agreed to merge with pharmacy benefit managers instead (Express Scripts and CVS Caremark respectively) while Humana teamed up with two private equity firms to buy the then-sprawling senior care empire Kindred Healthcare which Humana had cofounded and spun off decades earlier. The goal of all the transactions was vertical integration. As the business of selling health insurance policies to corporations was perceived as mature and competitive insurers figured they could maximize their profits by insourcing the most profitable segments of the health care supply chain.

This isn’t exactly a new strategy: Humana got its start as a nursing home operator that morphed in the 1980s into an integrated HMO-hospital chain then divested the hospitals to Rick Scott’s Columbia Hospital Corp. in the 1990s and former Cigna executive Robert Patricelli told the Chicago Tribune way back in 1985 that “moving up the ‘food chain’ [of patient services] into ownership of ambulatory care facilities and down in the other direction into ownership of after-care programs” was the “key to survival” in the insurance business.

But positions on the health care food chain are constantly shifting in response to market dynamics and regulator crackdowns. In 2018 Cigna bet big on morphing into a pharma middleman—much it’s worth noting to the chagrin of shareholder Carl Icahn who predicted that its “ridiculous” $67 billion purchase of Express Scripts would go down as one of “the worst acquisitions in corporate history” once the federal government eradicated the PBM business. Humana for its part focused on acquiring assets that would complement its booming Medicare Advantage business.

Regulators displayed little resistance as UnitedHealth rolled up the biggest medical empire of them all.

But only UnitedHealth had the foresight to do something insurance companies had never really done: use its leverage as a dominant payor to thousands of hospitals and medical practices to buy out the practices outright. The move was counterintuitive since individual doctors—especially primary care physicians—have perhaps never sunk as low as they are today on the proverbial “food chain.” But UnitedHealth bought practices primarily as a means of convincing their patients to enroll in their Medicare Advantage plans. Numerous whistleblower lawsuits have alleged that the mechanics by which UnitedHealth induced patients to sign on to its MA plans were illegal violations of anti-kickback statutes but they have done little to slow the dizzying growth of United’s MA business which now insures nearly 30 percent of the nation’s 30.8 million seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage.

Since 2011 when Optum bought out a massive 2300-physician practice in Southern California called Monarch HealthCare it has rolled up urgent care clinic and surgery center chains massive independent medical practices in Texas New York Massachusetts and Connecticut and a sprawling (and by many accounts dysfunctional) hospital physician staffing firm that was recently the subject of an investigation by The Oregonian. According to a presentation Optum CEO Amar Desai delivered Wednesday to investors United now employs or is “affiliated” with 90000 physicians close to one-tenth of the active physicians in the nation.

Notably while UnitedHealth was crisscrossing the nation on this frenzied clinic shopping spree its lobbyists and lawyers were positioning the insurance behemoth as a watchdog. The company supplied data along with the expertise of its executive Ted Prospect to researchers who published a series of landmark studies on the billing practices of private equity–owned emergency room staffing agencies EmCare and TeamHealth which became the defining health care policy issue of the 2020 election. The company’s legal battles with private equity–backed medical mega-practices from Radiology Partners to American Renal Associates to U.S. Anesthesia Partners brought much-needed public attention and regulatory scrutiny to the scourge of private equity firms using debt financing to roll up vast numbers of specialized medical practices then using their market dominance to gouge patients defraud insurers and shortchange physicians.

But while regulators began flailing around to respond to private equity’s terrifying conquest of health care they displayed little resistance as UnitedHealth rolled up the biggest medical empire of them all. Sadly UnitedHealth’s own incentives could prove substantially more harmful than what it was fighting against.

Maxwell Ollivant’s lawsuit—which he voluntarily dismissed last week after the DOJ declined to intervene—suggests that once it’s absorbed their patients UnitedHealth may not actually need that many physicians. Over the course of his employment Ollivant barely interacted with a single M.D. according to the lawsuit. (A message left with Ollivant’s parents was not returned.) His supervisor was a nurse practitioner as were all the other primary care providers in the Institutional Special Needs program. His interim director of clinical operations was a nurse practitioner his director of medical clinical operations was a physician assistant and two other people with similar titles who coached him in using “patient-tested language” to convince patients identified by Optum’s “mortality risk assessment tool” to lower their “aggressive expectations of care” and accede to signing DNRs were also nurse practitioners.

There is nothing inherently wrong with deploying nurse practitioners to perform duties traditionally done by physicians of course. But it is culturally more difficult for companies like Optum to bully doctors who have invested seven or eight years of their lives (and a half-million dollars) in medical school into abandoning their medical judgment in favor of a profit-maximizing algorithm and I suspect for that reason Optum deliberately keeps physicians away from their sickest patients. A Washington state emergency physician with whom I shared Ollivant’s lawsuit said that while some of its allegations read to him “like some dystopian movie” other details—like the role of emergency room staffing agency TeamHealth which allegedly maintains an agreement to notify Optum before its employees agree to hospitalize any of its Medicare Advantage patients—struck him as plausible.

COULD A MERGED HUMANA-CIGNA EVER HOPE to rival United’s brilliant dystopian business model? Cigna has failed miserably to gain traction in the Medicare Advantage business in which it claims only a 2 percent market share. Recently Cigna agreed to pay the DOJ $172 million and enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement to settle a whistleblower suit filed by a vendor alleging the company falsely claimed thousands of its Medicare Advantage recipients had complex and obscure illnesses on the basis of little to no legitimate diagnostic evidence in a bid to game the “risk scoring” system that determines the size of the monthly payment insurers receive for a particular patient. In November it reportedly put its Medicare Advantage business up for sale  possibly to avoid the burden of complying with the settlement. But Cigna is a lobbying juggernaut that has successfully fended off meaningful PBM reform despite overwhelming bipartisan support for the cause of ending PBMs altogether.

Humana on the other hand is the second-biggest Medicare Advantage insurer in the nation and the undisputed heavyweight throughout much of the Sun Belt where state regulations are more lax and cash-starved health systems have always been easier for corporations to boss around. The company also just hired former Optum president James Rechtin as its new CEO. And he probably doesn’t need it but a federal antitrust lawsuit filed against Optum last week by a small California hospital system offers something like an instruction manual for exploiting dominant market share to rule over the medical marketplace.

According to the complaint United in 2021 threatened to impose a unilateral 30 percent rate cut on the hospitals unless it agreed to dismantle its affiliated physician practice and cede all its patients to Optum. When the practice refused to play ball United began steering its Medicare Advantage patients to a for-profit hospital ten miles away causing the hospitals’ volumes to plunge by as much as 80 percent in some specialties. As the biggest Medicare Advantage insurer in Virginia Louisiana Mississippi Alabama Kentucky Arkansas the Carolinas and most enviably Florida Humana could similarly move to monopolize medical care in many of those markets. And conveniently Humana earlier this year announced it would be exiting the commercial insurance business entirely meaning it will have no overlapping business lines with Cigna and thus be unlikely to increase the market concentration as gauged by the Herfindahl-Hirschman index a boon with any federal judge in case the DOJ tries to block the merger.

That said far less aggressive antitrust agencies in past presidencies sharply rejected this very bid to whittle down the small group of major U.S. insurance companies; it doesn’t seem like this far more aggressive group at DOJ would suddenly welcome such consolidation. The market certainly seems to believe that the Biden administration will block the merger; the stocks of both Humana and Cigna plunged after the announcement.

But a former antitrust researcher who briefly worked for UnitedHealth speculated that antitrust regulators might be too preoccupied digging into that insurer—whose acquisition of the hospice and home health care provider Amedisys is the subject of a current antitrust probe—to have the bandwidth to block a Cigna-Humana deal. “Without any particular knowledge of the situation I think they’re hoping the DOJ is so unprepared to tackle UnitedHealth that the combined Cigna/Humana might seem appealing to regulators” he said.

And then there’s the possibility that corporate America is betting on a friendlier Trump antitrust regime to replace Biden’s aggressive enforcers Lina Khan and Jonathan Kanter in 2024. Merger reviews often have very long timelines and it’s very possible that there’s a change of power in Washington before any merger resolution is finalized. That’s something to look for in the coming months: Will CEOs begin to make a bet on a Trumpian restoration by divvying up the economy among themselves?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vYWJjMTEuY29tL2luc3VyYWNlLWNsYWltLWR1a2UtaG9zcGl0YWwtc3VwcGxlbWVudGFsLWluc3VyYW5jZS1jaWduYS8xNDEyODU5Mi_SAVlodHRwczovL2FiYzExLmNvbS9hbXAvaW5zdXJhY2UtY2xhaW0tZHVrZS1ob3NwaXRhbC1zdXBwbGVtZW50YWwtaW5zdXJhbmNlLWNpZ25hLzE0MTI4NTkyLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Troubleshooter helps Roxboro widow get $10000 insurance claim,"Troubleshooter helps Roxboro widow get $10000 insurance claim

ROXBORO N.C. (WTVD) -- A Roxboro widow tried for nearly a year to get results when it came to a supplemental insurance claim.

Since Angela White lost her husband Michael in November of 2022 she said she's been trying to get Duke University Hospital to file the necessary documentation with his supplemental insurance company.

""They were trying to tell me he doesn't have medical insurance and I'm like well I have told you multiple occasions this is not a medical claim"" White said. ""This is a supplemental insurance claim that pays out when a person's hospitalized.""

White said the insurance company tried to help and she spent months emailing Duke the information requested to file with his insurance. You can see one claim was processed but when it came to the other three claims for Michael it said the claim was still pending.

""From April May June called email back and forth and then I said well I need some help and that's when I reached out to you"" White said to Troubleshooter Diane Wilson.

Wilson got everything off to Duke University Hospital and White says things started happening. It didn't take long; the insurance company got what it needed and sent White a check for $10000 to cover the claims.

Duke Health officials provided this statement:

""We requested the policy number from the patient but it took several exchanges to receive it. Our inquiries to Cigna were also not fruitful until we could provide the policy number. We are always happy to help patients with billing questions and concerns and work to address inquiries promptly.""

As for White she's happy that after nearly a year of trying to get results the case is closed.

""I'm very happy with your results"" she told Wilson. ""If there's anybody out there that has any kind of issue and they come to their wits end do not hesitate to contact you because you work wonders for me. I've been going around eleven months with this situation.""

Meanwhile Kroger and Albertsons continue to act like the merger will be approved by the end of the first quarter in 2024. During Kroger’s third quarter earnings call on Thursday CEO Roger McMullen said integration planning with Albertsons is going well and the two grocers continue to make progress towards the first goal which is to assure continuity with workers and shoppers at closing.

Kroger has made financial moves which show the Cincinnati-based retailer is confident the merger will be approved soon. Share buybacks have been put on pause in an effort to reserve enough capital for the action and Kroger is also saving to pay down debt associated with the merger.

“We continue to work cooperatively with the FTC in its review of the transaction” McMullen said during the call. “We are confident that we have fulfilled all the commitments we set out in the original merger agreement including the comprehensive divestiture plan announced with C&S Wholesale Grocers.”

That deal involves the selling of 413 Kroger and Albertsons stores to C&S which could buy as many as 650 locations. If more must be divested Kroger and Albertsons could back out of the deal without penalty.

Opposition of the merger has been ongoing with states holding several town hall meetings over the last several months. Many of the gatherings have been attended by FTC Chair Lina Khan including the latest one in Colorado where several store workers and community members spoke out against the merger.

The tone was so negative Albertsons and Kroger provided statements to Supermarket News defending the deal.

“It was unfortunate that yet another listening session gave such a prominent platform to blatant mistruths about the merger” a spokesperson for Albertsons told Supermarket News. “Albertsons Cos. merging with Kroger will expand competition lower prices protect union jobs and enhance customers’ shopping experience in Denver and across the country.

“This merger would also ensure that our neighborhood supermarkets some of which have been serving communities for over 100 years can better compete with larger non-union retailing giants such as Walmart and Amazon.”

Kroger offered a similar assessment.

“Only non-unionized retailers like Walmart and Amazon will benefit if this merger is blocked” they said. “In fact Kroger joining with Albertsons will mean lower prices for customers secure union jobs and more food directed to hungry families with 10 billion meals committed to people in need across America by 2030.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqaGwuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvc2V0dGxlbWVudC1yZWFjaGVkLWluLWxhd3N1aXQtb3Zlci1jb2xsYXBzZWQtYnJpc3RvbC1ob3RlbC_SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy53amhsLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3NldHRsZW1lbnQtcmVhY2hlZC1pbi1sYXdzdWl0LW92ZXItY29sbGFwc2VkLWJyaXN0b2wtaG90ZWwvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Settlement reached in lawsuit over collapsed Bristol hotel,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wjhl.com/news/local/settlement-reached-in-lawsuit-over-collapsed-bristol-hotel/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndqaGwuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvc2V0dGxlbWVudC1yZWFjaGVkLWluLWxhd3N1aXQtb3Zlci1jb2xsYXBzZWQtYnJpc3RvbC1ob3RlbC_SAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy53amhsLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL3NldHRsZW1lbnQtcmVhY2hlZC1pbi1sYXdzdWl0LW92ZXItY29sbGFwc2VkLWJyaXN0b2wtaG90ZWwvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3NyZWNvcmQub3JnL2ZlYXR1cmVzL3N0dWRlbnQtdGVhY2hlcnMtYXQtdWMtcGV0aXRpb24tZm9yLXBheS9hcnRpY2xlX2U3MjQ4NTAyLTkwNjQtMTFlZS04ZGJhLWRmYTcwNDY0YzkyOS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Student teachers at UC petition for pay | Features | newsrecord.org,"Cincinnati OH (45221)

That is up to ESPN the network covering the game. Lyndsay Rossman the team’s director of business communications said similar technology has been used in other NFL stadiums and appeared in the background of pregame broadcasts.

Will it be set to holiday music?

No. The light show is set to a custom symphonic soundtrack.

Will the light show do ""The Wave"" and other patterns?

Rossman said the program the team is using will light all participating phones at once and cannot do section-by-section activations.

How does the app know what seat I am in?

It doesn’t. The system will use the stadium’s sound system to send a tone to every phone in the seating bowl that has the app activated. If you’re in the wrong seat it will still work (but you still may have to answer to the ushers).

Will the Jaguar light show work in the parking lot or restroom?

No it will only work on phones that have activated the app and are located in the stadium’s main seating bowl. It will not work on phones in the parking lot at home in the restrooms or in the stadium concourses.

Is there a charge to participate?

Downloading the app is free but you must have a ticket to the game to participate.

What happens if I go to the game and don’t download the app?

Nothing. The program only works if the app is downloaded and activated.

Will advertising appear on my phone?

Rossman said that the show will use phones’ microphones to listen for the activation tone and phones’ flashlights or camera flashes for the light show. There will be Jaguars’ content shown on the phone screen during the show she said.

Will the light show drain my phone’s battery?

Yes but not much. Rossman said the program will use about the same amount of power that users would consume watching a video with the flashlight activated. There are charging stations near gates 1 and 4 in the Bud Light Party Zone and on the fan deck.

What if I get a call during the light show?

Your phone should still function as a phone. But come on you're in the middle of a packed stadium and kickoff is imminent — do you really want to take that call anyway?

Will the program continue to use my phone’s microphone and flash after the light show is concluded?

Rossman said the app will only be active while the ultrasonic tone is being broadcast through the stadium. When it’s over the app will redirect phones to the Jaguars website. Fans can manually revoke access through their phones’ privacy settings or delete the app if they are concerned about privacy.

Is the light show dangerous in any way?

The Jaguars’ website includes the following disclaimer: “A flashing light display will be occurring during pre-game and at halftime. Any persons who are susceptible to photosensitive seizures or other light sensitivities should not participate and should avoid exposure to the flashing light display.”

CUE Audio the company that created the app says the audio tones it uses are also proven safe: ""CUE Audio is safe for babies; it's also safe for animals. The frequencies are entirely natural; we simply apply a pattern to them which the phone interprets as a message.""

What about the Baltimore game?

The Jaguars have another home night game coming up against the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday Dec. 17. The team plans to do a similar pregame light show at that game but will issue filters to fans that will turn the lights from white to teal."

Penyebabnya karena pengantin wanita di hadapan pendeta saat acara pemberkatan mengaku tidak mencintai calon suaminya.

Kronologi

Video saat calon mempelai menjawab pertanyaan pendeta tersebut diunggah di akun Facebook Fitra Dame Silitonga dan membuat kehebohan di depan pelaminan dan para tamu undangan.

Dalam video tersebut terlihat pihak keluarga histeris setelah ucapan pengantin wanita yang menyebut dirinya tak mencintai mempelai laki-laki.

Pengantin wanita tersebut mengatakan hal itu ketika ditanya Pendeta Binton Simanjuntak saat pemberkatan.

""Apakah kamu mencintai pasanganmu"" tanya pendeta dilansir dari TribunMedan.com.

Wanita tersebut menjawab pertanyaan tersebut dengan kata tidak.

Pendeta tiga kali menanyakan pertanyaan itu namun jawaban pengantin wanita tetap sama bahwa tidak mencintai calon suaminya.

Menurut pengunggah ia menyebut bahwa kejadian tersebut baru pertama kali terjadi di Kecamatan Sipahutar.

""On pe adong na masa di sipahutar on songonon (baru kali ini ada kejadian seperti ini di Sipahutar). Bubar pemberkatan disaat pendeta bertanya pada pengantin perempuan apakah engkau mencintai pasanganmu? Si pengantin perempuan menjawab tidak"" tulisnya.

Akibat pengakuan pengantin wanita tersebut keduanya akhirnya gagal menikah.

Penjelasan pendeta HKI

Pendeta Binton Simanjuntak pendeta yang memimpin acara pemberkatan pernikahan kedua pengantin menjelaskan duduk perkara kejadian tersebut.

Ia meyakini pernikahan bersifat sakral sehingga memilih tak mau melanjutkan pemberkatan tersebut.

""Saya sebagai pendeta tidak berani melanjutkan pemberkatan pernikahan"" ujar Pendeta Binton Simanjuntak Jumat (1/12/2023).

Selanjutnya ia menjelaskan secara detail alasan pembatalan pemberkatan pernikahan tersebut.

Tiga kali ditanya mempelai perempuan tetap menjawab dirinya tak mencintai mempelai laki-laki tersebut.

""Alasannya sudah pasti bahwa perempuan itu tidak mencintai laki-lakinya dan tidak ada unsur yang lain"" ungkapnya.

""Pertanyaan pendeta begitu jelas saya bertanya sampai tiga kali apakah engkau mencintai dan menyayangi calon suamimu? Tidak. Sampai tiga kali"" tuturnya.

Baru dijodohkan 3 bulan

Selain itu Pendeta Binton juga menyampaikan perihal perkenalan kedua mempelai yang masih seumur jagung.

Bahkan hal itu ia tanyakan juga kepada mempelai saat acara pernikahan di dalam gereja.

Mempelai laki-laki mengakui dirinya berteman dengan mempelai perempuan masih tiga bulan.

Di film itu dia tak cuma berakting tetapi juga bernyanyi. Tahun ini dia mulai menekuni dunia tarik suara.

Nuansa bunyi pada lagu ”Menanti” ini bergaya pop romantik yang pernah populer di dekade 1980-an. Vokal Tatjana yang ringan dan halus menggambarkan penantiannya pada pujaan hati. Iringan musik besutan Aradea Banendra ini bisa bikin menari-nari kecil sembari menatap kaca jendela yang tersiram air hujan bulan Desember.

Pemain film Tatjana Saphira belakangan ini merambah dunia tarik suara. Pada pertengahan tahun tepatnya 24 Agustus dia melepas lagu perdana ”Ke Manakah Cinta”. Pekan lalu Jumat (24/11/2023) lagu keduanya meluncur berjudul ”Menanti”. Kesenduan lagu ini rasanya pas mengiringi cuaca bulan Desember yang cenderung adem.

Bagi Tatjana ”Menanti” adalah romantisasi hasrat dan angan-angan. ”Cinta itu hal yang kompleks tidak selalu menyenangkan tapi juga bisa membuat kita merasa utuh dan bahagia” ujar perempuan berusia 26 tahun ini. Pada lagu itu terasa bahwa Tatjana mengeksplorasi wilayah abu-abu; antara gembira dan risau.

Lirik lagu ini ditulis Adinda Dwidamasari. Namun selama proses produksinya Tatjana hadir di antara produser dan pemusik. Mereka mendiskusikan bentuk suara yang diinginkan dan mengarahkan imajinasi lagu. Lagu-lagunya bernaung di label Anukara Records. Beberapa bulan mendatang Tatjana siap melepas lagu baru yang bernuansa sedih.

Di layar lebar penampilan Tatjana bisa disimak pada film Sweet 20 (2017). Dia menjadi bintang utama. Aktingnya diganjar nominasi Pemeran Utama Wanita Terbaik FFI 2017. Di film yang diadaptasi dari film Miss Granny (2014) itu Tatjana juga menyanyi empat lagu yakni ”Bing” ”Payung Fantasi” ”Layu Sebelum Berkembang” dan ”Meraih Asa”.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rcmpvZ2phLmNvbS9wZXJpc3Rpd2EvMTI0MzM1MDY5MC9maWxtLWNpbnRhLXRhay1wZXJuYWgtdGVwYXQtd2FrdHUtYWRhcHRhc2ktbm92ZWwtYmVzdC1zZWxsZXItZGlhbmdrYXQta2UtbGF5YXItbGViYXLSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua3Jqb2dqYS5jb20vcGVyaXN0aXdhL2FtcC8xMjQzMzUwNjkwL2ZpbG0tY2ludGEtdGFrLXBlcm5haC10ZXBhdC13YWt0dS1hZGFwdGFzaS1ub3ZlbC1iZXN0LXNlbGxlci1kaWFuZ2thdC1rZS1sYXlhci1sZWJhcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Film 'Cinta Tak Pernah Tepat Waktu' Adaptasi Novel Best Seller Diangkat ke Layar Lebar - Krjogja,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.krjogja.com/peristiwa/1243350690/film-cinta-tak-pernah-tepat-waktu-adaptasi-novel-best-seller-diangkat-ke-layar-lebar on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rcmpvZ2phLmNvbS9wZXJpc3Rpd2EvMTI0MzM1MDY5MC9maWxtLWNpbnRhLXRhay1wZXJuYWgtdGVwYXQtd2FrdHUtYWRhcHRhc2ktbm92ZWwtYmVzdC1zZWxsZXItZGlhbmdrYXQta2UtbGF5YXItbGViYXLSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua3Jqb2dqYS5jb20vcGVyaXN0aXdhL2FtcC8xMjQzMzUwNjkwL2ZpbG0tY2ludGEtdGFrLXBlcm5haC10ZXBhdC13YWt0dS1hZGFwdGFzaS1ub3ZlbC1iZXN0LXNlbGxlci1kaWFuZ2thdC1rZS1sYXlhci1sZWJhcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vYmVuZ2t1bHUuYW50YXJhbmV3cy5jb20vYmVyaXRhLzMyMTQ4MC91bml2ZXJzaXRhcy1iZW5na3VsdS1iZXJkdWthLW1haGFzaXN3aS1idW51aC1kaXJpLWRpZHVnYS1rYXJlbmEtcHV0dXMtY2ludGHSAX1odHRwczovL2JlbmdrdWx1LmFudGFyYW5ld3MuY29tL2FtcC9iZXJpdGEvMzIxNDgwL3VuaXZlcnNpdGFzLWJlbmdrdWx1LWJlcmR1a2EtbWFoYXNpc3dpLWJ1bnVoLWRpcmktZGlkdWdhLWthcmVuYS1wdXR1cy1jaW50YQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Universitas Bengkulu berduka mahasiswi bunuh diri diduga karena putus cinta,

Training and running advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models requires more than just powerful graphics processing units (GPUs). Those GPUs do the heavy lifting but feeding the ultra-powerful chips with data can become a bottleneck. A cluster of servers with tens of thousands of GPUs linked together requires some heavy-duty networking gear to make it all work.

Cisco Systems (CSCO -0.42%) is the longtime leader in the switching and routing markets with its proprietary products maintaining dominant market shares. Across the entire enterprise network infrastructure market the company managed a 41% share in 2022 quadrupling that of its nearest competitor.

Cisco's model of bundling its proprietary hardware and software isn't appealing to everyone. A more flexible approach makes sense for the major cloud providers which build data centers at incredible scale and have very specific networking needs.

Cisco competitor Arista Networks which builds its networking gear using merchant silicon from third parties and layers a fully programmable operating system on top has had great success in winning business from some of the cloud giants.

Going after the AI market

Given that the major cloud providers are scooping up the bulk of powerful GPUs to build out their AI capacity Cisco would be missing out on a huge market without a change in strategy. The company hasn't had much of a presence among the major cloud providers in recent years but its Silicon One family of networking chips is changing the picture.

""We regained our footing there because we listened and we showed flexibility with our willingness to disaggregate if they wanted to do so"" said Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins during the latest earnings call speaking of the major cloud providers. ""So I think that the disaggregation and the flexibility and us listening to them and understanding what they wanted was the reason that we got back in"" Robbins continued.

Cisco's Silicon One chips can power ultra-fast switches and routers allowing cloud providers to build the networking architecture they need in their massive data centers. The chips are fully programmable and support massive data throughput making them ideal for AI networks.

Cisco is having some early success with its AI-focused products and expects significant revenue down the road. The company's Ethernet AI fabric is deployed at three major hyperscale companies and it expects to receive more than $1 billion in orders for AI infrastructure from major cloud providers in fiscal 2025. So far the company has booked about $500 million in orders. By 2027 the market for AI switching is expected to top $10 billion.

Cisco will be going up against Arista which is growing rapidly thanks in part to a heavy dependence on Microsoft and Meta Platforms. Cisco's market share doesn't yield any advantages in winning business from major cloud providers so its products must stand on their own. So far the company appears to be gaining meaningful traction.

Is Cisco stock a buy?

Cisco generates more than $50 billion in revenue annually so AI-related revenue will be a minor contribution for the foreseeable future. Even if demand for Cisco's AI products grows rapidly the company's overall results are still heavily tied to the state of the economy. During times of economic uncertainty Cisco's customers can pull back on tech spending and delay orders.

Cisco stock looks reasonably priced trading for about 12 times the company's guidance for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings. However the company is facing some headwinds as customers work through products delivered as Cisco was bringing its backlog down to normal levels. Cisco expects one or two quarters of lower revenue before growth rebounds to more normal levels.

There's a risk that this slowdown will become more drawn out as customers pull back in an uncertain economic environment which would put pressure on Cisco's profits. Still a reasonable valuation coupled with a long-term opportunity to tap into the AI infrastructure market makes Cisco stock an interesting proposition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ldHdvcmt3b3JsZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xMjUwMTAzL2Npc2NvLWpvaW5zLTEwbS1mdW5kaW5nLXJvdW5kLWZvci1hdml6LW5ldHdvcmtzLWVudGVycHJpc2Utc29uaWMtZHJpdmUuaHRtbNIBfWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ldHdvcmt3b3JsZC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xMjUwMTAzL2Npc2NvLWpvaW5zLTEwbS1mdW5kaW5nLXJvdW5kLWZvci1hdml6LW5ldHdvcmtzLWVudGVycHJpc2Utc29uaWMtZHJpdmUuaHRtbC9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cisco joins $10M funding round for Aviz Networks' enterprise SONiC drive,"Cisco is part of a new round of investing – which has now reached $10 million – aimed at making Aviz Networks’ SONiC-based operating system more mainstream.

Top Analyst Reports for Exxon Mobil Oracle and Cisco Systems

The Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks including Exxon Mobil Corp. Oracle Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.



You can see all of today’s research reports here >>>



Shares of Exxon Mobil have underperformed the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - International industry over the past year (-4.4% vs. -2.9%). The company’s dividend yield is lower than the composite stocks belonging to the industry. Thus ExxonMobil is lagging its peers when it comes to shareholders’ returns.



Moreover the integrated company reported weak third quarter earnings primarily resulted from the oil equivalent production decline and lower realizations of crude and natural gas prices. Nevertheless ExxonMobil's bellwether status and an optimal integrated capital structure that has historically produced industry-leading returns make it a relatively lower-risk energy sector play.



In the Stabroek Block located off the coast of Guyana ExxonMobil has made many major discoveries that significantly improve its production outlook. The advantaged growth projects of Guyana have lower greenhouse gas intensity than most of the oil and gas-producing resources across the globe.

Oracle shares have gained +44.3% over the year-to-date basis against the Zacks Computer - Software industry’s gain of +57.3%. The company is benefiting from the ongoing momentum across its cloud business driven by the strong uptake of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and Autonomous Database offerings. Solid adoption of cloud-based applications comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Fusion ERP bodes well.



Oracle’s Gen 2 Cloud is delivering better performance at a lower cost due to high bandwidth and low-latency RDMA networks. Partnerships with VMWare and Microsoft are helping Oracle win new clientele. ORCL is launching a generative AI cloud service for enterprise customers. Its share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy.



However higher spending on product enhancements especially toward the cloud platform amid increasing competition in the cloud domain is likely to limit margin expansion.

Shares of Cisco Systems have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Networking industry over the year-to-date basis (+4.0% vs. +2.1%). The company is riding on the growing demand for its security artificial intelligence and cloud products. Its security portfolio is benefiting from the launch of new data loss prevention firewall and zero trust capabilities.



Zero Trust portfolio is riding on strong demand for its Duo offering. Optimized application experience is benefiting from strong demand for ThousandEyes. Its investments across security business focusing on cloud-based and AI-driven offerings is expected to drive growth.



Expanding growth opportunities for low-power-consuming technologies including IoT Silicon One and Power over Ethernet bodes well for Cisco. Acquisitions including Lightspin Technologies Smartlook and Armorblox are expected to benefit top-line growth.

Citigroup discrimination lawsuit overview:

Who: Ardith Lindsey filed a lawsuit against Citigroup Global Markets Inc.

Why: Lindsey claims Citigroup tolerates a work environment where women like herself allegedly face sexual harassment sexual assault and gender discrimination.

Where: The lawsuit was filed in New York federal court.

A managing director at Citigroup who is currently on a leave of absence claims she has faced “horrifying” sexual harassment sexual assault and gender discrimination while working for the bank since 2007.

Plaintiff Ardith Lindsey — who has worked for Citigroup for more than 16 years — claims many senior male executives at the bank have created an environment that is “openly and notoriously hostile to women.”

Lindsey argues this alleged hostility is known about and tolerated by Citigroup which she claims has in some instances “encouraged a locker room environment on its trading floor” where male employees have “treated women as sexual objects and denigrated their accomplishments.

“In many instances Citi did nothing to stop the egregious legal violations despite Lindsey and other women making complaints” the Citigroup lawsuit states.

Male executives at Citigroup ranked rated appearance of female coworkers says suit

Lindsey claims male executives at Citigroup would rank and rate the appearance of their female coworkers openly discuss which ones they wanted to have sex with mock sexual harassment trainings and exclude women from professional opportunities among other things.

“In this environment numerous male executives in the Equities division regularly flouted the anti-discrimination and harassment laws without consequences” the Citigroup lawsuit states.

Lindsey argues she was repeatedly subjected to “extreme sexual harassment” and despite fear of retribution she claims executives warned her of ultimately decided last year that she had “no choice” but to confront Citigroup.

“As a result of defendant’s unlawful acts plaintiff has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable injury emotional distress reputational injury and other compensable damages” the Citigroup lawsuit states.

Lindsey claims Citigroup is guilty of negligent hiring negligent retention and/or negligent supervision and of discrimination under New York City Human Rights Law.

The plaintiff is demanding a jury trial and requesting declaratory relief along with an award of compensatory and punitive damages.

In other news involving Citigroup a class action lawsuit was filed against it and three additional major banks in June over claims they conspired in online chatrooms and on electronic devices to fix the price of British pound sterling denominated UK government bonds.

In 2015 196 parties adopted the breakthrough Paris Agreement at the COP15 meeting creating a legally binding international treaty focused on keeping the rise in the mean global temperature below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.

At the COP26 meeting in 2021 world leaders assembled again to lay out a global agenda for a path to net-zero emissions and they established an actionable framework around the promises made in the Paris Agreement. Once the plan was put together the next challenge was figuring out how to pay for global action on climate change. Between 2016 and 2020 climate-related projects mobilized between $600 billion and $900 billion on average annually. However to reach the IEA Net Zero by 2050 Scenario an estimated $125 trillion is required over the next 30 years. Despite global finance flows more than doubling in 2022 to $1.4 trillion from 2020 the estimated annual climate finance gap between 2030 and 2050 is nearly 7x 2022 flows.

Investment progress in the energy transition is being made — in developed markets via private capital financing and in emerging markets primarily from public sector capital and supranational organizations. To achieve already-established global climate goals much of the climate finance in the coming decades will be in emerging markets. The challenge is to mobilize private capital with lower risk profiles to invest in higher-risk emerging markets that need funding for climate projects.

In this report we lay out a framework for the development of “bankable projects” that relies on stakeholders to building an understanding of the challenges facing each party by creating an enabling environment looking at projects through an investment prism developing a project lifecycle and delivering successful outcomes.

What this means in practice is each stakeholder doing their part to bring very much needed climate finance to emerging and developing markets. For public sector this means developing a stable and predictable political and economic backdrop while also intentionally setting a climate agenda. Government officials should work with multilateral development banks (MDBs) development finance institutions (DFIs) and importantly the private sector to prepare complete feasibility studies that further their climate agendas. MDBs and DFIs know that they are a major contributor to the mitigation of risk and their ability to reform their frameworks for capital deployment among other calls will be key to the success of scaling in new markets or technologies. Private sector corporates and financial institutions also play a role; their ability to understand risks markets and the immense opportunities ahead is imperative.

The hard part of the energy transition is mostly done — there is a will to invest in projects and there is capital to fund those projects. Bridging the gap and releasing the flow of capital is the next step.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9pbmRpYS1idXNpbmVzcy9iYXJjbGF5cy1jaXRpLXJhaXNlLWluZGlhcy1lY29ub21pYy1ncm93dGgtY2xvc2VyLXRvLTctYWZ0ZXItZ2RwLWJvb3N0L2FydGljbGVzaG93LzEwNTY0NDM3MS5jbXPSAaABaHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvaW5kaWEtYnVzaW5lc3MvYmFyY2xheXMtY2l0aS1yYWlzZS1pbmRpYXMtZWNvbm9taWMtZ3Jvd3RoLWNsb3Nlci10by03LWFmdGVyLWdkcC1ib29zdC9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvMTA1NjQ0MzcxLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Barclays Citi raise India’s economic growth closer to 7% after GDP boost,"What Bloomberg economics says

Economists raised their full-year projections for India’s economy sharply after data on Thursday showed growth outperformed last quarter fueled by a manufacturing boom.Barclays Plc and Citigroup Inc predict the economy will now expand 6.7% in the fiscal year ending in March up from previous forecasts of 6.3% and 6.2% respectively. Several other analysts also bumped up their estimates.The optimism stems from Thursday’s report showing gross domestic product rose 7.6% in the three months to September from a year ago higher than any of the estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists.The figure was also significantly above the Reserve Bank of India’s projection of 6.5%.India is holding onto its position as the fastest-growing major economy in the world with growth remaining resilient in the face of a global slowdown and the Reserve Bank of India’s six interest rate hikes since last year. It’s also a boost for Prime Minister Narendra Modi  who is seeking to retain power in elections next year.Last quarter’s growth beat came from a boost in manufacturing construction and a ramping up of government investment ahead of elections. Modi’s administration is spending billions of dollars to boost the nation’s infrastructure and is providing subsidies for firms looking to set up production in India.Businesses are also expanding operations adding to the strong growth in investment. Growth in gross fixed capital formation a proxy for investment accelerated to 11.04% last quarter from 7.95% in the previous three months.In the services sector which makes up more than half of the nation’s GDP growth slowed last quarter as global demand for financial services moderated. Agriculture also weakened because of below-normal rains which resulted in a weaker summer crop harvest.“The sharp upside surprise to the GDP figures is a welcome sign especially as it comes in the backdrop of a broad-based pickup across most non-agricultural sectors” said Upasna Bhardwaj economist with Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd. “The full year GDP numbers have got a big filip after today’s figures” she said.Strong growth presents a dilemma for the central bank which is trying to keep inflation at its 4% target on a sustained basis. The RBI has left interest rates unchanged for four policy meetings now although it’s maintained a fairly hawkish stance.The RBI is likely to keep interest rates on hold on December 8 with the GDP figures indicating there’s no urgency for the RBI to cut rates yet.India’s better-than-expected third quarter GDP growth supports our call for the central bank to hold-off against rate cuts in the near term. Notwithstanding a slowdown in the agricultural sector stronger industrial activity powered a positive growth surprise. This reflects structural forces that are helping the country accelerate its integration into global supply chains.Abhishek Gupta Bloomberg economics"

More Solutions for I&I Issues

Lysol Pro & BlueDot Forecast Concurrent Rise in Flu RSV & Covid-19

Predictive analysis conducted for Reckitt’s Lysol Pro Solutions by data experts at BlueDot Inc. suggests that US businesses should anticipate a concurrent rise in flu RSV and covid-19 this year but that the onset of respiratory virus season will be closer to typical pre- pandemic timing than last year.



“With flu and RSV expected to hit the US at a similar time businesses should deploy effective germ reduction strategies to help address the spread through both surfaces and air” said Dr. Julie McKinney director of R&D at Reckitt’s Lysol Pro Solutions. “The season has historically shaved off productivity from businesses due to worker and school absenteeism. Early indicators suggest that this year is likely to mirror pre-pandemic trends compared to last year which was highly unpredictable.”



According to McKinney holistic hand and surface hygiene including the use of EPA-approved products such as Lysol Disinfectant Spray or Lysol Disinfecting Wipes as well as a focus on “effective cleaning measures on germ-harboring hot spots can help reduce the spread of germs and support a more productive workforce.”



Last year the flu season began on average seven weeks earlier than pre-pandemic trends. This year signs from the southern hemisphere suggest that the flu season is trending toward pre-pandemic patterns according to Lysol.

Cleaning Curated

The I&I cleaning category has a long history in innovative technologies that keep surfaces sparkling stop the spread of germs and keep bacteria at bay—and there’s a place that pays homage to it all: the Museum of Clean. Attendees at the ISSA Show were able to get a taste of what’s inside the 74000 sq.ft. facility in Pocatello ID through a display on the show floor in Las Vegas last month.



The museum was opened in 2011 by Don Aslett an industry icon with his own storied history in the cleaning industry.

Whirlpool’s In-School Laundry Program Helps Combat Chronic Absenteeism

Whirlpool is embarking on its eighth—and biggest—year of the Care Counts Laundry Program which provides access to washers and dryers in schools primarily located in underserved communities. The idea is to help remove a small but important barrier to attendance: access to clean clothes.



For the 2023-2024 academic year the program has expanded to 154 schools across 40 states including new schools in Connecticut Michigan Montana North Carolina and Oregon.



Whirlpool began installing washers and dryers in schools in 2015. The program now provides an estimated 50000 students with clean clothes. Based on findings from the 2022-2023 academic year nearly 80% of participating high-risk elementary school students where the program is active saw an increase in student attendance.



By 2028 Whirlpool expects to expand the Care Counts Laundry Program to all 50 states.

“You are doing something that really truly matters in the world” ISSA Executive Director John Barrett told an audience assembled last month for “Then Now Forever: Celebrating 100 Years of ISSA”—a special event held just before the doors opened on the 2023 ISSA Show North America Las Vegas. ISSA —the worldwide cleaning industry association—has come a long way since 1923 when its predecessor the National Sanitary Supply Association was formed with seven founding members. A century ago just a handful of manufacturers were part of the membership of the fledging organization.Today ISSA has about 1000 manufacturer members whom Barrett called the “heart and soul of this convention.”They fuel the industry as well.Inside the ISSA North America show which this year was held at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center were manufacturers of disinfectants dish detergents and air care products  as well as makers of tools and devices to dispense wash scrub and dispose. All told ISSA has more than 10500 members spanning distributors manufacturers and manufacturer reps building service contractors (BSCs) in-house service providers residential cleaners and associated services.It is an ecosystem that insures consumers’ most favorite and important spaces are clean. And that in turn protects the health and wellness of everyone—whether a football stadium filled with Swifties a local school packed with students and teachers or a corporate office seeing a steady stream of workers back at their desks and inside conference rooms.Leading cleaning solution manufacturers not only formulate in the lab—they’re tracking flu season collaborating with microbiologists digging into societal needs to deliver improved hygiene for more people and sourcing more sustainable solutions. And if that’s not enough they provide training programs to help their busy customers who remain under great pressure from labor shortages.The pressure cooker atmosphere of the pandemic has subsided but cleaning professionals are still under the gun. Many are burned out according to recent polling from CloroxPro . In the CloroxPro’s 2023 Clean Index report—which reflects the current challenges and perceptions of more than 1700 cleaning professional—nearly nine out of ten (87%) cleaning professionals personally experienced burnout in the past two years.This troubling stat comes as consumer confidence in the cleanliness of public spaces increased 23% during the past year. According to Clorox 59% consumers are confident in the professional cleaning industry’s ability to aid in preventing the spread of illness-causing germs up from 48% in 2022. That confidence stems from important visual and sensory cues that make consumers feel safe—think a clean pleasant smell seeing janitors and staff cleaning shiny floors or bright and clean walls/surfaces and public availability of disinfectant wipes.Despite this Clorox Pro data revealed cleaning professionals feel less confident year-over-year in their ability to prevent the spread of illness-causing germs. In fact cleaning professionals’ confidence fell nearly 5% compared to last year with the largest confidence drop among building-service contractors ( down 15% vs. 2022). The primary drivers of declining confidence were cited as a lack of training programs (22% up 9% vs. 2022) and more public scrutiny of cleaning practices (20% up 6% vs. 2022).According to CloroxPro the data reinforces how much responsibility is placed on cleaning professionals and the need to ensure they have the tools and support to create clean and healthy public spaces.For CloroxPro that can mean delivering ready-to-use (RTU) cleaning and disinfecting products like Clorox EcoClean which includes EcoClean Disinfecting Cleaner which is made with a plant-based active ingredient that kills 99.9% of illness-causing germs in two minutes or less when used as directed. This product garnered The Clorox Company an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 2023 Green Chemistry Award in the “Designing Greener Chemicals” category. The EcoClean product range also includes all-purpose cleaner and glass cleaner.According to CloroxPro 82% of cleaning professional cite killing germs as the most important quality for eco-friendly cleaners. Jordan Bastian senior infection preventionist at The Clorox Company says EcoClean offers facilities managers and professional cleaning staff numerous benefits—from efficacy and versatility to reduced effort and time saved.Similar sentiments were echoed across the show floor at ISSA last month. Collectively the I&I cleaning space is constantly pushing its resources toward solving key pain points for cleaning professionals.Take Ecolab’s entry in the 2023 ISSA Innovation Award competition: Ecolab Rapid Multi Surface Disinfectant Cleaner. With both hard and soft surface claims this “4-in-1” solution is versatile; it can be a hospital disinfectant a streak-free glass cleaner in the office a bactericide for high-touch counters and even sprayed on upholstered chairs in the hotel lobby according to officials. What’s more it can be applied with spray bottles mop microfiber pad bucket auto scrubber and electrostatic sprayer.“Cleaning staff deserve a solution that works in the way they do today” said Amanda Bakken an Ecolab chemist who presented the Rapid Multi Surface Disinfectant Cleaner on the ISSA show floor. “It is a disinfectant that goes where you go.”Improved efficiency in cleaning is increasingly being driven by technology too. While consumers are familiar with touch-free units that provide squirts of soap or roll out a paper towel on demand IoT and connected dispensers provide tangible benefits for cleaning service professionals and facilities managers.“They are contending with labor shortages and they are interested in having smart dispensers that help their skeleton staff be more efficient by sending a ping or notification to janitor/manager’s iPhone or tablet. This way they can spend less time checking dispensers that are full or half-full and focus on the ones that are empty” said Laura Mahecha director of industrial and institutional cleaning practice at Kline & Company. Tork Vision Cleaning uses real-time data from connected dispensers and people counters to help facility managers and cleaning staff know when and where cleaning and dispenser refilling are needed. According to Tork this relates to a 91% reduction in dispenser checks. And as sensors track movement a cleaning manager knows when a conference room sits unused and therefore doesn’t require immediate attention.According to Kline’s Industrial & Institutional Hand Care report  34.3% of respondents in a survey conducted this summer said they used smart (IoT) dispensers at their facility or customer’s facility and 40.4% said they did not but planned to install them. The remainder said they did not and did not plan to install. The survey encompassed 508 respondents across building service contractors healthcare foodservice education retailers industry lodging and sport/fitness.Newer dispensers are also more sustainable.As of October 11 existing Tork brand dispensers in the US (and 15 in Canada) are carbon neutral. Tork says it is one of the first in its class in North America to have reduced and offset carbon for the entire lifecycle of selected soap toilet paper and hand towel dispensers. Carbon emissions have already been reduced by using purchased renewable electricity in the production and the remaining carbon emissions are offset with verified credits from climate projects according to the brand which is part of Essity. SC Johnson Professional’s Proline Wave Dispenser is a one-liter dispenser made with 70% Recovered Coastal Plastic (plastic that is collected on land within 31 miles of an ocean in countries with high volumes of uncollected plastic waste). The dispenser’s recovered plastic materials are sourced through SCJ’s partnership with Plastic Bank. Each dispenser uses the equivalent of 16 16.9 fl.oz. recovered coastal plastic waste plastic bottles.Proline Wave is compatible with SC Johnson Professional’s full line of Refresh Foam soaps which use 30% less product and can reduce average water consumption as much as 45% when washing and rinsing hands compared to traditional lotion soap said the company. Independent tests show that washing hands with foam soap rather than lotion soap can reduce average water consumption by as much as 45% when using a modified hand wash approach of dispensing soap on dry hands and turning the tap on only when rinsing off.Foaming soap is at the heart of Soap2o Ltd a company that exhibited at the ISSA Show for the first time to tout its Super Hydro Pod. According to officials its point of differentiation is its increased sustainability profile and ease of use. One pod creates one gallon of foaming soap when dropped into a gallon container with water and agitated by hand for about a minute. The company plans to expand beyond hand soap offering shampoos and other personal care products in 2024.More sustainable solutions are being sought by endusers of I&I products including the hospitality sector which is pursuing green practices due to both new regulations and customer expectations.“We are starting to see increased usage of amenities dispenser in hotel rooms across the country” said Mahecha of Kline.According to Kline’s Janitorial and Housekeeping Cleaning Products USA study more than 20 states have laws banning single use plastics (SUPs) but the initiative has taken hold on a more widespread nature due to the cost savings afforded hotel operators by using bulk products in dispensers rather than small bottles.Across the ISSA show floor in Las Vegas there were solutions for all types of I&I settings.In addition to offering a sneak peek of its new laundry lineup due out next spring (Tide Professional commercial laundry detergent in pods liquid and powder and Downy Professional commercial fabric softener) P&G Professional showcased new Dawn Professional Heavy Duty Manual Pot and Pan detergent. The proprietary formula made with Dawn Professional’s highest level of proprietary grease-cutting surfactant contains three times more baked-on grease cleaning power to help dishwashers spend less time and energy on greasy cookware and can reduce scrubbing by 50% from active ingredients that do more of the work.“With the time and effort they spend on cleaning greasy pots and pans and other kitchen tools back-of-house kitchen staff have some of the hardest jobs in a restaurant but rarely are celebrated by customers. Restaurant owners want a detergent that saves time and makes the lives of their dishwashers easier” said Paul Edmondson vice president of P&G North America in a statement.Like dirty pots and pans ants are another thing customers don’t want to see when dining out.To that end Henkel this year showcased its Combat brand which provides roach and ant killing solutions for professional kitchens as well as commercial and manufacturing settings offices and more. The newest product in the range is Combat 2-in-1 Ant Bait billed as the first 2-in-1 in the US market according to James Lothrop a Combat brand manager.Ants according to Henkel officials Happi spoke with at ISSA are historically picky eaters but Combat’s 2-in-1 solution is designed to kill 11 kinds of ants by way of two baits: one grease-based the other sugar-based (officials at the show likened it to a “buffet”). Ants take the bait back to the colony eliminating insects at the source.O3 Technologies Inc. Los Angeles showcased its OxiTerminator Mattress Sanitizer a system that allows hotel workers to clean and disinfect mattresses in less than 30 minutes. It would offer an alternative to the cumbersome process of removing a mattress from a room and taking it to a disinfection truck according to Andy Rifkin founder and chief technology officer.According to Rifkin O3’s work centers on the use of activated oxygen or O3 (hence its name). First the mattresses are placed into a sealed leakproof bag. Then activated oxygen is pumped in “pulled through” the layers of material at “safe therapeutic levels” and subjected to UVC light and a series of catalysts. The process is said to kill covid and other disease-causing pathogens as well as mold parasites bed bugs fleas and mites.The mattresses need to be vacuumed after the process according to the company.O3 Technologies also developed a commercial sonic mop adapter that can be attached to existing commercial mops as well as Swiffer-style tools. The OxiTerminator Mattress Sanitizer is set to launch at the end of Q1 2024 with the mop adapter following in Q2 2024.NPD continues around use of natural components in disinfectant technologies. According to Kline 38% of end users view green cleaning products to be as effective as traditional cleaning chemicals. Demand is increasing for products with active ingredients that are plant-based or botanical such as lavender citric acid and thymol notes Kline.Last month Diversey signed a multi-year licensing accord with Virox Technologies to bring its patented disinfectant technology known as Citr-IQ to the healthcare sector and other segments. Diversey will add multiple disinfectant products powered by Virox’s Citr-IQ to its lineup of professional offerings.Citr-IQ is a synergistic blend that effectively kills pathogens by harnessing the natural disinfectant power of citric acid. Citr-IQ maintains the balance of efficacy and safety that Virox antimicrobial technologies are known for while advancing performance in sustainability and material compatibility according to Diversey. Citr-IQ’s synergistic chemistry is said to be powerful enough to eliminate pathogens of concern including SARS-CoV2 ESBLs norovirus and Candida auris. Additionally it is the first citric-acid-based tuberculocidal disinfectant with a one-minute contact time and the first one-minute tuberculocidal disinfectant compatible with fully biodegradable wipes. It is safe for multiple surfaces and devices including plastics and soft metals.Under the terms of the agreement Virox will receive undisclosed license fees and royalties for the use of the formulas covered under the Citr-IQ platform. It will manufacture products containing the Citr-IQ formulas for Diversey’s North American markets.This new accord lengthens a 24-year-long partnership; Diversey had previously licensed accelerated hydrogen peroxide (AHP) chemical disinfectant technology from Virox which Diversey fully acquired in 2019. AHP is the active ingredient in multiple brands including Diversey’s Oxivir and Accel infection prevention platforms.Indie brands are also developing safer solutions for I&I cleaning. Dear Planet Labs Placentia CA exhibited at ISSA for the first time. Its Everyday Disinfectant Spray contains just three ingredients: hypochlorous acid (HOCI) water and salt. The limited-ingredient spray eliminates 99.9% of bacteria and viruses including covid-19 in 60 seconds. It is EPA List-N and List-Q approved and offers an alternative to traditional disinfectant sprays formulated with quats said officials.Safer smarter and more sustainable solutions are the future of I&I cleaning.",,,,,,,,,,,,

(NASDAQ:CME) Before It Goes Ex-Dividend,"Some investors rely on dividends for growing their wealth and if you're one of those dividend sleuths you might be intrigued to know that CME Group Inc. ( NASDAQ:CME ) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning you will need to purchase CME Group's shares before the 7th of December to receive the dividend which will be paid on the 28th of December.

The company's upcoming dividend is US$1.10 a share following on from the last 12 months when the company distributed a total of US$8.90 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions CME Group has a trailing yield of approximately 4.1% on its current stock price of $219.54. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders but only if the dividend continues to be paid. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered and if earnings are growing.

Check out our latest analysis for CME Group

Dividends are usually paid out of company profits so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. CME Group paid out more than half (51%) of its earnings last year which is a regular payout ratio for most companies.

Generally speaking the lower a company's payout ratios the more resilient its dividend usually is.

Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?

When earnings decline dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. Investors love dividends so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. CME Group's earnings per share have fallen at approximately 7.0% a year over the previous five years. However readers should note that the company recognized a significant net tax benefit five years ago potentially influencing the overall assessment.

The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years CME Group has lifted its dividend by approximately 17% a year on average. That's interesting but the combination of a growing dividend despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out more of the company's profits. This can be valuable for shareholders but it can't go on forever.

To Sum It Up

From a dividend perspective should investors buy or avoid CME Group? Earnings per share have been declining and the company is paying out more than half its profits to shareholders; not an enticing combination. These characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance and investors may not be happy with the results of owning this stock for its dividend.

With that being said if you're still considering CME Group as an investment you'll find it beneficial to know what risks this stock is facing. For example - CME Group has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.

Generally we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see. Here's a curated list of interesting stocks that are strong dividend payers.

Indeed the main indexes were mostly lower to start the day but swung higher after Powell took the mic.

Speaking at Spelman College in Atlanta the head of the central bank said it is ""premature"" to say with certainty that the Fed has ""achieved a sufficiently restrictive stance"" or to speculate on rate cuts. Powell added that while recent lower inflation readings – including October's Consumer Price Index (CPI) – ""are welcome"" the Fed's ultimate goal is to reach the 2% target.

Still this morning's data from S&P Global and the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) showed manufacturing activity remained in contraction territory in November. The bad-news-is-good news readings had market participants thinking the economy has cooled to the point where no more rate hikes are needed.

Disney reinstates dividend after three-year hiatus

In single-stock news Walt Disney (DIS) made waves after the entertainment and media giant reinstated its dividend after suspending the payout at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Additionally amid reports that activist investor Nelson Peltz is seeking seats on Disney's board of directors the company said it has added Morgan Stanley (MS) CEO James Gorman and former head of Sky TV Jeremy Darroch to its board.

While Gorman and Darroch ""represent an improvement from the status quo the addition of these directors will not in our view restore investor confidence or address the root cause behind the significant value destruction and missteps that this Board has overseen"" said Trian Fund Management Peltz's investment management firm in a statement . ""Trian intends to take our case for change directly to shareholders.""

Troise and Alex Viega

Associated Press

New York — A broad rally on Wall Street closed out a fifth straight week of gains for the market Friday driving the S&P 500 to its highest level in more than a year.

The benchmark index rose 0.6% eclipsing its previous high for the year set in July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 0.8% higher while the Nasdaq composite added 0.6%. Gainers outnumbered decliners by roughly 6-to-1 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The latest gains followed the market's best month in more than a year. Growing expectations on Wall Street that the Federal Reserve may cut interest rates a soon as early next year have put investors in a buying mood.

“A lot of investors now are accelerating when the Fed is likely to initiate its first cut to the end of the first quarter of 2024 rather than the the prior forecast of some time in the second quarter” said Sam Stovall chief investment strategist at CFRA.

Hope that the Federal Reserve is finally done raising interest rates in its fight to control inflation helped push markets steadily higher through much of November. Recent economic data supports that view.

On Thursday the Fed’s preferred measure of inflation showed a cooling last month. Inflation has been easing overall since the middle of 2022 when the Fed started aggressively raising its benchmark interest rate. That followed mostly encouraging updates on economic growth and consumer confidence that have raised hopes that the Fed will achieve its sought-after “soft landing” which involves cooling the inflation without throwing the economy into a recession.

A government report on Friday showed that construction spending continued rising in October topping economists’ forecasts for growth. Wall Street will get several updates next week on the job market including the government’s closely watched monthly employment report for November.

Speaking at Spelman College in Atlanta on Friday Fed Chair Jerome Powell said “It would be premature to conclude with confidence” that the central bank has raised its benchmark interest rate high enough to fully defeat inflation. He added that it’s not the time to speculate on when the Fed will cut rates.

That didn’t dash Wall Street’s optimism of a Fed rate cut happening as soon as next spring. Investors see a nearly 56% chance of it happening in March up from just a 21% chance a week ago according to data from CME Group.

Treasury yields have been broadly falling amid sentiment that the Fed’s aggressive rate hike policy is finished and potentially heading for a reversal. The trend continued Friday. The yield on the 10-year Treasury which influences mortgage rates fell to 4.21% from 4.34% late Thursday. It was as high as 5.00% in October.

The yield on the two-year Treasury fell to 4.55% from 4.70% late Thursday. Falling bond yields have helped relieve pressure on stocks especially technology stocks.

Investors entered December on track to close out the year with solid gains. The S&P 500 is up 19.7% and the Nasdaq composite is up 36.7% in 2023. Smaller-company stocks have also recently turned higher for the year following the market’s recent rally. The Russell 2000 index is now up 5.8% for the year.

All told the S&P 500 rose 26.83 points to 4594.63 its highest level since March 30 2022. The Dow added 294.61 points to close at 36245.50. The Nasdaq gained 78.81 points to finish at 14305.03.

European markets closed higher and Asian markets finished mostly lower.

Industrial stocks were among the biggest gainers Friday. Construction equipment maker Caterpillar rose 2.4% and railroad operator Union Pacific rose 2.7%.

Elsewhere in the market computer maker Dell fell 5.2% after giving investors a weaker-than-expected revenue forecast. Beauty products retailer Ulta Beauty jumped 10.8% after reporting results that beat estimates.

Oil prices remained relatively steady. They have been broadly easing for several months as have U.S. gasoline prices. That is helping to relieve pressure on American families and businesses from rising prices."

To meet the rapidly growing global demand low-carbon hydrogen is indispensable in addition to green hydrogen. TÜV SÜD has developed a new standard for the certification low-carbon hydrogen and blue hydrogen and for its derivatives (currently ammonia).

At present the chemical industry accounts for the largest share of global hydrogen demand. In the future hydrogen will also be used as storage medium for energy from renewable sources for the decarbonisation of various industry sectors and in the transport sector. “Hydrogen is pivotal in combatting climate change driving the transition to cleaner energy and promoting sustainable economic growth worldwide” said Thore Lapp Business Unit Manager Green Energy & Sustainability TÜV SÜD. “Given that a fully renewable future with green hydrogen and its derivatives will take some time low-carbon hydrogen and its derivatives have to bridge the time until there is enough green hydrogen available to cover the demand” added Bratin Roy Senior Vice President Industry and Sustainability TÜV SÜD South Asia South-East Asia Middle East & Africa Region.

To support and promote the emergence of a low-carbon economy TÜV SÜD has developed the TÜV SÜD CMS 77 standard for the certification of low-carbon hydrogen or blue hydrogen and their derivatives (currently ammonia). Introduced in 2023 the new standard will be continuously adapted to current and future developments and legal and normative requirements. The TÜV SÜD CMS 77 standard is applicable to all companies worldwide seeking to demonstrate their compliance with criteria set in the regulatory frameworks of various countries and regions and to show their commitment to a sustainable future-proof energy supply.

The TÜV SÜD CMS 77 standard sets a maximum threshold for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction potential allowed in the production process for hydrogen and its derivatives to be considered as 'low-carbon products'. According to the standard the greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction of low-carbon hydrogen/blue hydrogen and low-carbon ammonia/blue ammonia must be at least 70% compared to the global benchmark of 94 gCO 2 eq/MJLHV. This corresponds to a GHG value of not more than 28.2 gCO 2 eq/MJLHV. Further the claim of blue hydrogen/blue ammonia the TÜV SÜD CMS 77 standard additionally requires the construction and use of facilities for carbon capture and geological storage with robust proof of permanency of geological storage.

Similarly to the green hydrogen certification standard CMS 70 TÜV SÜD has defined the requirements and guidelines for the quantification and reporting of the carbon footprint of low-carbon hydrogen and blue hydrogen and its derivatives in a way that is consistent with international standards such as ISO 14040 ISO 14067 ISO 27915 and ISO 17029.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvcmVuZXdhYmxlcy9jb3AyOC1pbmRpYS1jaGluYS1yZWZyYWluLWZyb20tc2lnbmluZy1wbGVkZ2UtdG8tdHJpcGxlLXdvcmxkcy1yZW5ld2FibGUtZW5lcmd5LWNhcGFjaXR5LWJ5LTIwMzAvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvMTA1Njg0MjE2LmNtc9IBrgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvcmVuZXdhYmxlcy9jb3AyOC1pbmRpYS1jaGluYS1yZWZyYWluLWZyb20tc2lnbmluZy1wbGVkZ2UtdG8tdHJpcGxlLXdvcmxkcy1yZW5ld2FibGUtZW5lcmd5LWNhcGFjaXR5LWJ5LTIwMzAvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzEwNTY4NDIxNi5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COP28: India China refrain from signing pledge to triple world's renewable energy capacity by 2030,"

Dubai: India and China both on Saturday refrained from signing the pledge at the COP28 climate summit to triple the world's renewable energy capacity by 2030 even though New Delhi already committed to it as part of its G20 presidency. During the UN's climate talks here 118 countries committed to tripling the global renewable energy capacity by 2030 in a highly endorsed initiative.This ambitious goal aims to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels in the world's overall energy production.The countries which backed the pledge included Japan Australia Canada Brazil  Nigeria and Barbados.Although China and India have expressed endorsement for the threefold increase in renewable energy by 2030 neither of them formally supported the comprehensive pledge on Saturday.This commitment involves scaling up clean power alongside a decrease in the utilisation of fossil fuels.The pledge called for phase down of unabated coal power and putting an end to the financing of new coal-fired power plants.""Unabated"" fossil fuels generally refer to the continued use of coal oil and gas without efforts to curtail emissions. Nonetheless a universally accepted and precise definition of this term is currently lacking.The International Energy Agency says the world must triple its renewable energy capacity and double the rate of energy efficiency by 2030 to drive down demand for fossil fuels and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century.India's decision has gauged mixed reactions from Indian experts.Madhura Joshi Senior Associate and India Energy Transition Lead at E3G expressed disappointment over India's decision not to sign the global pledge aiming to triple renewable energy and double energy efficiency by 2030.""These pivotal decisions were initially championed by the Indian G20 presidency and endorsed by G20 leaders in September 2023"" Joshi said.Joshi highlights the significance of transitioning away from fossil fuels particularly coal to achieve net-zero commitments. Despite India's ambitious targets for renewable energy with plans to reach 450GW by 2030 the hope is that New Delhi will endorse these global goals at COP28 leveraging its leadership position in the renewables sector.Vibhuti Garg Director of South Asia at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis notes India's commitment to tripling the renewable energy target as part of the G20 reiterated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at COP28 in Dubai.While India exhibits serious ambitions for renewable energy Garg emphasised the country's silence on coal phase-down.""Achieving India's renewable energy goals will necessitate a tripling of investments prompting the country to advocate for additional funding support from the Global North through blended finance mechanisms including multilateral development bank (MDB) green bonds equity investors and insurance and pension funds"" he added.Ulka Kelkar the Executive Director of Climate at World Resources Institute (WRI) India underscored the global target of tripling renewable energy capacity adopted during India's G20 presidency.She highlighted the magnitude of India's National Determined Contributions (NDC) target requiring the country to build as much renewable capacity as currently exists on the entire continent of South America.Kelkar emphasises the transformative impact on various sectors enabling vehicles buildings cookstoves and industries to run on cleaner electricity.Additionally she recognises energy efficiency as a crucial component of the clean energy transition capable of delivering tangible benefits especially for micro small and medium enterprises.Dr Ajay Mathur Director General of the International Solar Alliance expresses delight at the global commitment to tripling renewable capacity by 2030.He emphasised the dual benefits of fostering development and mitigating climate change emphasising the urgency of accelerating the growth of renewables for a successful transition towards clean energy.

New model launches on the card: The latest in mid-December 2023

Bengaluru-based electric vehicle startup Simple Energy unveiled its maiden product the One electric scooter in August 2021 and had since created a buzz among the potential EV buyers. In fact the product appeared to be an instant hit even before the launch as the company claimed that it had received over 65000 pre-bookings for the model within three months since the wraps were taken off.Fast forward to November 2023 five months after the e-scooter was officially launched there’s a word in the consumer base that the EV maker is planning to shut shop. What has gone wrong? Is it already the end of the road for a promising startup? Well we have the answers.After having dispatched the first batch of the One in June earlier this year the company has managed to only deliver some sub-50 units until now thereby not living up to its promises. In fact quite recently some of the customers who pre-booked the model have received communications from the company that their booking has been cancelled and the amount will be refunded without any deductions.So far even after the cancellation of about 10 percent the company sits at a healthy order book of over 80000 units and a challenge to deal with. Suhas Rajkumar  Founder and CEO Simple Energy spoke at length about the ongoing speculations with TOI Auto and revealed the company's future plans both immediate and distant which includes new product launches.Simple Energy says that there were several fake websites that had started to take orders in the name of the company to dupe the customers of their money. “A lot of websites have cropped up boasting about how they can get you the Simple One quicker. They took orders and pre bookings and a lot of people were given false promises through those websites which were not our official websites. We detected a lot of them across India.” Rajkumar revealed.Speaking about the e-mails the customers received which said that all bookings are being cancelled he said “On that e-mail they (outsourced agency) mentioned that we are refunding all the people so there was a typo error. That went out to 2-3 people once we got the notice from our PR agency we immediately acted on that CRM because it's also not in-house controlled. We stopped those calls last month. This exercise was done roughly about three weeks back.”Several customers were concerned as they had been receiving calls from the company in which they were asked if they wanted to continue their bookings or not thus giving an expression that the company isn’t confident of fulfilling the demand. To which Rajkumar explained that they always ask customers if they want to retain the booking which is a part of legalities. “We have a routine exercise that we do and at the end of the call we always have the same question which is ‘Would you like to retain the booking or you would want to process the cancellation’. This is always done to ensure the customers that we are always there to refund 100 percent of their money because not everyone would read the website or our terms and conditions”The EV maker has fell significantly short from its delivery promises. However it says that the production line has now been streamlined and there’s a large order that’s set to be dispatched very soon. “We mentioned during our launch as well that we would be doing a trial run before we scale to a level and fortunately for us we have streamlined our production lines and our supply chain and we have a large order to go out in December. From January onwards we are going to be regular”“We don't want our customers to cancel their bookings because now that we are beginning to scale I think we would need them now more than ever” he added.“Initially we will target the South and the West Zone in the next four months. We expect to sell 100 units a month in the prominent Southern and Western cities which will propel us to 10000 units a month by the end of the ongoing FY.” noted a motivated Rajkumar.Earlier this year TOI Auto broke a story that Simple Energy just like its rivals Ola Electric and Ather Energy will be launching an affordable iteration of its One electric scooter. Well it’s time. Rajkumar told us that the EV maker will be launching the Dot One in mid-December with the deliveries set to begin in the third week itself. The company said that it will be calling up their pre-booked customers and will offer them the option to buy a lower variant.While the scooter gets no cosmetic or feature upgrades its cost has been brought down as it will only be offered with the fixed battery option and four colour variants on offer as against the six with One. The upcoming Dot One will be equipped with only the fixed battery delivering 151 km of certified range and 160 km in IDC. The performance and specs of the model will remain the same as One. The Dot One can achieve 40 kmph from a standstill in just 2.77 seconds.It will come equipped with a battery capacity of 3.7 kWh. Furthermore the familiar 8.5 kW electric motor employed in the Dot will generate a peak torque of 72 Nm. It is also equipped with CBS and disc brakes. The scooter has more than 30 litres of under-seat storage. Other features include a touchscreen instrument cluster that controls various functions and gets app connectivity as well.Besides that the company plans to launch a family scooter based on the Simple One platform sometime next year. “We have also completed our Alpha stage of testing for what we call a ‘family scooter’. It is based on the same platform. Two years back we started off this program in-house.

Hydrogen is poised to become a central player in the global effort to combat climate change and drive the transition towards sustainable energy. As a versatile energy carrier and storage medium hydrogen is expected to address the surging global demand with a particular emphasis on low-carbon and blue hydrogen alongside the already established green hydrogen. TÜV SÜD recognizing the crucial role of hydrogen in the energy landscape has unveiled a groundbreaking standard designed for the certification of low-carbon hydrogen blue hydrogen and their derivatives with a current focus on ammonia.

Currently the chemical industry stands as the largest consumer of hydrogen globally. Looking ahead hydrogen is anticipated to play a pivotal role not only in the chemical sector but also as a storage medium for renewable energy facilitating the decarbonization of various industries and contributing to the transformation of the transportation sector. Thore Lapp Business Unit Manager for Green Energy & Sustainability at TÜV SÜD underscores the significance of hydrogen in combating climate change steering the shift to cleaner energy and fostering sustainable economic growth worldwide.

In alignment with the goal of fostering a low-carbon economy TÜV SÜD has developed the TÜV SÜD CMS 77 standard specifically tailored for the certification of low-carbon and blue hydrogen along with their derivatives like ammonia. Introduced in 2023 this innovative standard is designed to remain adaptive continuously evolving to align with current and future developments legal frameworks and normative requirements. It extends its applicability to companies globally offering a mechanism for them to showcase compliance with criteria outlined in the regulatory frameworks of diverse countries and regions affirming their commitment to a sustainable and future-ready energy supply.

The TÜV SÜD CMS 77 standard introduces a crucial parameter setting a maximum threshold for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction potential within the hydrogen production process. To attain the classification of 'low-carbon products' the standard stipulates that low-carbon hydrogen blue hydrogen and low-carbon ammonia must achieve a minimum GHG reduction of 70% compared to the global benchmark of 94 gCO2eq/MJLHV. This corresponds to a specific GHG value not exceeding 28.2 gCO2eq/MJLHV. Additionally for the claim of blue hydrogen and blue ammonia the TÜV SÜD CMS 77 standard mandates the construction and operation of facilities for carbon capture and geological storage with robust evidence ensuring the permanency of geological storage.

Drawing parallels with TÜV SÜD's green hydrogen certification standard CMS 70 the CMS 77 standard outlines specific requirements and guidelines for the quantification and reporting of the carbon footprint associated with low-carbon and blue hydrogen along with their derivatives. These guidelines align with internationally recognized standards such as ISO 14040 ISO 14067 ISO 27915 and ISO 17029 ensuring a consistent and credible approach to carbon footprint quantification and reporting.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvcmVuZXdhYmxlcy9odWwtdG8tcGFydG5lci1icm9va2ZpZWxkLWZvci1ncmVlbi1lbmVyZ3ktdG8tbWVldC1uZXQtemVyby1jb21taXRtZW50L2FydGljbGVzaG93LzEwNTY1OTQ5NC5jbXPSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L3JlbmV3YWJsZXMvaHVsLXRvLXBhcnRuZXItYnJvb2tmaWVsZC1mb3ItZ3JlZW4tZW5lcmd5LXRvLW1lZXQtbmV0LXplcm8tY29tbWl0bWVudC9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvMTA1NjU5NDk0LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HUL to partner Brookfield for Green Energy to meet Net Zero commitment,"It seems like you're already an ETPrime member with

A charismatic soda and the branding to match Coca-Cola is more than just a beverage. Today the Coca-Cola Company is one of the largest food and beverage corporations reporting nearly $10 billion in profits in 2023. But as historian Bartow J. Elmore argues in a 2013 article in Enterprise & Society the company and its signature product’s rise to dominance from its relatively humble origins in 1886 in the hands of a broke Atlanta pharmacist was no coincidence. Instead it resulted from a deliberately calculated plan to extract and acquire natural and social resources at minimum cost for maximum profit.

Elmore tracks how in the early days of the company Coca-Cola established key relationships in the supply chain ranging from public commodities to Monsanto to the Federal Bureau of Narcotics to drive down production costs. Ultimately Elmore writes Coca-Cola’s secret formula was a particular brand of capitalism based on the company’s “ability to embed itself in technological supply and distribution systems built maintained and financed by others.”

Though the recipe for Coke is famously proprietary Elmore easily traces the environmental history of the company and beverage’s widespread success through a handful of well-known ingredients such as water sugar caffeine and coca. Elmore argues that Coca-Cola savvily siphoned resources from public and private entities to cheaply procure these key ingredients and establish a lean mean global supply chain and market for their product.

Coca-Cola’s tactics began with an ingredient as fundamental as water which we now experience as freely and widely available. But in the early twentieth century in America public commodities such as waterworks were just starting to emerge—and Coca-Cola seized the opportunity to prop up the systems through its franchised bottling model and conveniently offload upfront costs of bottling and shipping their “water-dense” product. Beginning in 1900 the company recruited local businessmen to rouse up $3000 to establish regional franchises that would serve as regional bottling plants. Elmore recounts that many bottlers took out loans to start and consequently relied on the expanding public water systems to save on costs. This cost savings was then passed on to Coca-Cola “broaden[ing] its bottling empire at low cost.” Indeed Elmore notes that “as public water systems expanded into less-densely populated areas of the country by the 1910s so too did Coke’s franchisees.”

Later in the twentieth century Coca-Cola used a similar tack to expand business abroad. Elmore writes that the company secured foreign assistance loans by “argu[ing] that it could bring hydration to communities lacking basic water infrastructure” such as in the Middle East Southeast Asia and Africa through its earlier experience supporting American water infrastructure. Reviewing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) records though Elmore found that “these projects often helped Coke sell bottled water and other products rather than encourage the development of large-scale public water works.”

The story of Coca-Cola told from a natural resources perspective demonstrates how…food and beverage production at scale was and is an extractive enterprise with substantial social and environmental impact.

Most iconically Coca-Cola used coca leaf extract in their secret recipe—sourced early on from a partnership with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. This as Elmore puts it “exposes yet another federal-corporate partnership that enabled Coke to purchase a key ingredient at low cost.” DEA-declassified documents in the National Archives show how Coca-Cola “secure[d] exclusive access to legal coca imports” after coca imports were criminalized in 1914. The FBN gave Coca-Cola “special exemptions” that allowed the company to purchase decocainized coca leaf extract while denying exemptions for the same ingredient to other buyers.

“By restricting buyer access to coca leaves” Elmore writes “the federal government helped to create a monopsony for Coca-Cola” ensuring they were the only buyers for the “exotic ingredient” and forever linking the substance with the brand.

Elmore outlines how Coca-Cola established similar low-cost and low-commitment relationships to source ingredients like caffeine—initially from agricultural giant Monsanto then from decaf coffee maker General Foods—or to abdicate social responsibility such as the endless plastic and aluminum waste their products generate. More broadly the story of Coca-Cola told from a natural resources perspective demonstrates how like consumer goods and agriculture food and beverage production at scale was and is an extractive enterprise with substantial social and environmental impact.

For Elmore with its emergence at the turn of the twentieth century Coca-Cola heralds “a new type of corporation that emerged in the Gilded Age” with few fixed assets but extraordinary market reach. Indeed a product like Coca-Cola—and many of our processed foods today—“gained life by finding a way to market the excesses of mass-producing industrial firms” Elmore writes further distancing consumer habits from their resource-intensive origins.

Meanwhile the industry is shifting towards a model focusing on higher prices smaller packs and premium brands.

Refranchising​

Coca-Cola has announced it is accelerating its refranchising plans:​​ it will now refranchise 100% of Company-owned North American bottling territories by the end of 2017 including all cold-fill production facilities. This is three years ahead of the original target date.

It also announced this week that it has entered into a non-binding letter of intent to refranchise bottling operations in China to existing partners China Foods Limited (part of COFCO Ltd) and Swire Beverage Holdings Ltd.

This follows the announcement of the new Coca-Cola European Partners​​ for Western Europe last year (the world’s largest independent Coca-Cola bottler formed by the merger of Coca-Cola Enterprises Coca-Cola Iberian Partners and Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetränke). In partnership with SABMiller a new bottler for Africa - Coca-Cola Beverages Africa​​ – was created at the end of 2014.

Coca-Cola CEO and chairman Muhtar Kent said the company will “look very different” ​once the refranchising transformation is complete. The strategy will allow the company to focus its efforts on building strong valuable brands. ​

Telford said: “The intention of refranchising is to shed expensive global bottling operations to make Coca-Cola a more nimble less capital intensive and more profitable beverage business. But this is not simply about profitability.​

“Widespread changes in consumer consumption of soft drinks – seeking new healthier functional and natural drinks – necessitate a companywide focus on the creation and marketing of its brands as well as aggressive new product development to satisfy these changing consumer needs.​

“The company (and investors) are happy to leave bottling and distribution of finished products to reliable independent partners while Coca-Cola works on improving and expanding its future product portfolio.” ​

Higher prices premium brands​

Coca-Cola – and other large soft drinks companies – have been developing a new model: higher prices smaller packages and premium brands delivering modest volume growth but greater profitability said Telford.

This can be through mini-cans smaller bottles single-serve occasions functional waters and energy drinks.

Trend-watching Howard Telford will be taking part in Beverage Innovation 2016 a free-to-attend online event from BeverageDaily and FoodNavigator-USA. Telford will be on the trend-watching panel on February 18: find out more here.​​

“Bottled water tea and juice are the growth areas in Q4 and FY2015” ​said Telford. “Globally bottled water is the main driver of soft drinks volume growth for Coca-Cola in almost all markets as Euromonitor’s latest data for 2015 confirms. ​

""Coca-Cola has benefited from this category shift but seeks a stronger leadership position with investments in brands like Smartwater Dasani and Aquarius.” ​

Carbonates remain more of a challenge added Telford but notes Coca-Cola’s ‘Taste the Feeling’ campaign​​ which seeks to integrate all Coke trademark brands in its marketing efforts. This campaign does have the potential to help introduce low calorie brands to new consumers he said.

North America​

Coca-Cola Company CEO Muhtar Kent has championed the results from Coca-Cola’s flagship North America market which had its strongest annual performance in three years.

“In a recent interview with MSNBC Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent recently called the US his 'favourite emerging market' – a tongue in cheek comment that nevertheless reflects opportunities arising from the fundamental shifts in consumption we are seeing in North America and other higher income regions” ​said Telford.

This could include growth in higher value functional beverages like Smartwater or healthier premium beverages like tea cold pressed juice or sparkling flavored water.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vcmVzdGF1cmFudHMvY29jYS1jb2xhLXByZXNpZGVudC1zaGFyZXMtd2h5LWl0LWtpbGxlZC1hLXBvcHVsYXItYmV2ZXJhZ2UtYnJhbmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Coca-Cola president explains why it killed a popular beverage brand,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/restaurants/coca-cola-president-shares-why-it-killed-a-popular-beverage-brand on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vcmVzdGF1cmFudHMvY29jYS1jb2xhLXByZXNpZGVudC1zaGFyZXMtd2h5LWl0LWtpbGxlZC1hLXBvcHVsYXItYmV2ZXJhZ2UtYnJhbmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vYmxvb2xvb3AuY29tL2JyYW5kcy1pcC9uZXdzL3NvbG9tb24tZ3JvdXAtc2NlbnQtZGlzY292ZXJ5LWxvY2FsLXByb2plY3RzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Solomon Group | collaborates with Local Projects,"Solomon Group an award-winning leader in exhibit fabrication AV systems integration and live event production has collaborated with Local Projects a multi-disciplinary design studio to reimagine the Scent Discovery experience at the World of Coca-Cola.

The World of Coca-Cola welcomes over a million visitors each year. Its new immersive Scent Discovery exhibition offers a fresh perspective on the relationship between aroma flavour and memory. This is partly inspired by Coca-Cola founder Asa Candler who identified Coke’s original secret formula ingredients by smell.

Michelle Moorehead vice president global licensing retail and attractions The Coca-Cola Company explains: “We know that scent is a powerful trigger for memory and emotion. World of Coca-Cola’s Scent Discovery offers guests the opportunity to experience the attraction – and the world – in an entirely new way to create new scent-based memories while infusing fresh insight into existing memories and emotions.”

Designed for high-volume traffic

Solomon Group are Coca-Cola’s owner’s representation scenic fabrication and AV integration firm and together with Coca-Cola appointed Local Projects to develop the design for the Scent Discovery experience.

Over its 20 years in culture educational and corporate experience design Local Projects has amassed a wide range of accolades including the Cannes Gold Lion Fast Company’s Design Studio of the Year and Best Design in North America Award the National Design Award and the Overall Excellence in Exhibitions from the American Alliance of Museums.

The project sought to reimagine a Scent Discovery experience that would be exciting and engaging without long lines or overcrowding. The team devised a design strategy that carefully addressed how each section of the experience could circulate visitors around the area at a constant and intuitive speed informed by an analysis of the current visitor flow and pain points.

Solomon Group then developed and built out Local Projects’ design and in only four months created a new interactive experience. This drew on the expertise of the Solomon NEXT and Solomon HERE teams in Orlando to work on technical design A/V design prototyping and testing a durable experience that would withstand high-volume traffic from curious adults and children.

Interactive gamified experience

Amelia Falco Local Projects designer says: “The new Scent Discovery Experience at the World of Coca-Cola takes each visitor on an exploration of Coca-Cola’s brand history and human memory transforming an existing 1000 square foot space into a stimulating journey where scent becomes the vehicle for visitors to unlock personal memories create new ones and broaden their understanding of Cola-Cola’s unparalleled past present and future.”

The experience begins in The Scent Library an interactive installation offering over 20 aroma profiles from around the world (both familiar and unusual). Visitors’ senses are transported to unexpected corners of Coca-Cola’s brand history and product line as they take in each aroma and guess its unique origins. Each aroma also provides visitors with the opportunity to relive olfactory memories from their own life prompting them to contemplate the role scent plays in our personal history.

Upon entering Scent Discovery visitors learn how “topographies of scent” have played an important part in brand history beginning with Coca-Cola originator Candler. According to legend Candler would remove the labels from the ingredient bottles used in Coca-Cola’s secret formula and blend the contents using only his sense of smell – his own topography of scent.

Next visitors enter the iconic Coca-Cola bottle. Here they will breathe in the fragrance of a freshly opened Coca-Cola while standing inside smooth glass walls underneath a sparkling chandelier of carbonated bubbles. The sensory experience of drinking a Coke becomes tactile and tangible in the room allowing guests to appreciate it in an unexpected way.

Guests complete their journey by entering an interactive gamified experience that enables them to put their newly developed senses to the test. Friends family and strangers come together at interactive gaming stations to play a smell guessing game led by a Coca-Cola ambassador. Each correct response reveals a vibrant expressive and bizarre visual scene that encourages guests to be transported to new imaginative realms by fragrance.

Graphics in the Scent Discovery exit hallway present the diverse aroma profiles of many beverages as attractive gradients. Guests are encouraged to visit the beverage-tasting experience in the following gallery and compare the flavour profiles of each beverage to the scent profiles presented in the Scent Discovery exhibit.

With excellent social media traffic and positive reviews for the new exhibit Scent Discovery 2.0 enhances visibility and value to the overall World of Coca-Cola experience and retains its position as one of the leading attractions in Atlanta and the world.

Solomon Group announced a rebrand earlier this year following its continued growth in 2022. The firm’s three specialities are now known as SolomonNOW (Live Events) SolomonHERE (Themed Environments) and SolomonNEXT (Experiential Technology).

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt when you think about how risky any given stock is because too much debt can sink a company. Importantly Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation (NASDAQ:CTSH) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.

What Risk Does Debt Bring?

Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off either with new capital or with free cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. While that is not too common we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course plenty of companies use debt to fund growth without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.

Check out our latest analysis for Cognizant Technology Solutions

How Much Debt Does Cognizant Technology Solutions Carry?

The chart below which you can click on for greater detail shows that Cognizant Technology Solutions had US$647.0m in debt in September 2023; about the same as the year before. However it does have US$2.37b in cash offsetting this leading to net cash of US$1.72b.

How Strong Is Cognizant Technology Solutions' Balance Sheet?

Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data we can see that Cognizant Technology Solutions had liabilities of US$3.19b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$2.01b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations it had cash of US$2.37b as well as receivables valued at US$3.81b due within 12 months. So it actually has US$978.0m more liquid assets than total liabilities.

This surplus suggests that Cognizant Technology Solutions has a conservative balance sheet and could probably eliminate its debt without much difficulty. Succinctly put Cognizant Technology Solutions boasts net cash so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!

But the other side of the story is that Cognizant Technology Solutions saw its EBIT decline by 3.5% over the last year. If earnings continue to decline at that rate the company may have increasing difficulty managing its debt load. When analysing debt levels the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings more than anything that will determine Cognizant Technology Solutions's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.

Story continues

Finally while the tax-man may adore accounting profits lenders only accept cold hard cash. Cognizant Technology Solutions may have net cash on the balance sheet but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow because that will influence both its need for and its capacity to manage debt. Over the most recent three years Cognizant Technology Solutions recorded free cash flow worth 77% of its EBIT which is around normal given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.

Summing Up

While we empathize with investors who find debt concerning you should keep in mind that Cognizant Technology Solutions has net cash of US$1.72b as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$2.0b being 77% of its EBIT. So we don't think Cognizant Technology Solutions's use of debt is risky. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Cognizant Technology Solutions you should know about.

When all is said and done sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt. Readers can access a list of growth stocks with zero net debt 100% free right now.

Global headwinds weigh

BFSI vertical declined in Q2 in growth terms

High interest rate not likely to come down soon

Mortgage capital market most impacted segments

Bengaluru: Financial services vertical of global and Indian IT firms is facing the maximum stress owing to macroeconomic uncertainties and it’s unlikely to change till the next year. Experts are of the opinion that despite contributing the maximum share to most IT firms’ revenues BFSI (banking financial services and insurance) vertical may not see much revival in the US and European geographies.

“BFSI is most prone to macroeconomic fluctuations. That is the reason that the growth in BFSI vertical remains low as compared to other verticals like healthcare or manufacturing” Pareekh Jain an IT outsourcing advisor & founder Pareekh Consulting.

Reflection of such performance came from Cognizant which announced its results on November 1. BFSI which is the largest vertical for the Nasdaq-listed IT firm saw four per cent decline in the revenue from this vertical on year-on-year basis.

“Within financial services revenue declined four per cent reflecting the softer demand environment across regions and sub-industries. This decline was partially offset by the benefit from the resale of third-party products in connection with our integrated offering strategy” Jan Siegmund Chief Financial Officer of Cognizant said during conference call.

Such trend was earlier seen among Indian IT firms. Infosys saw a decline of 7.3 per cent YoY basis in its revenue during the second quarter from its BFSI vertical. Similarly Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) witnessed a decline a 0.5 per cent in its BFSI revenue during this period.

Management of various IT firms have said that within BFSI vertical; mortgage and capital markets have been facing slowdown. Higher interest rate regime ruling in the US and European Union (EU) has dented growth in the mortgage segment of the BFSI vertical.

Many experts also said that the slowdown in BFSI vertical however is leading to more cost takeout deals coming to the market place. That is the reason that many large deals have been won in recent quarters from BFSI segment. Infosys won around five large deals from the BFSI vertical in the September quarter.

According to sources in the know things may not improve in the coming two quarters given the high interest rate regime in the developed economies.

“Inflation has definitely come down both in the US and Europe. However central banks are not comfortable enough to reduce interest rates as inflation is still not in their comfortable zone. That is the reason that rates are not likely to come down in the near future” V Balakrishnan chairman Exfinity Ventures & former CFO of Infosys told Bizz Buzz.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vanVzdHdvbWVuc3Nwb3J0cy5jb20vcmVhZHMvdWNvbm4tYmFza2V0YmFsbC1pbmp1cmllcy1henppLWZ1ZGQtcGFpZ2UtYnVlY2tlcnMtYXlhbm5hLXBhdHRlcnNvbi0yMDIzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Timeline of UConn’s injury woes from Paige Bueckers to Azzi Fudd,"UConn basketball has had no shortage of injuries over the last three seasons.

Aubrey Griffin missed the entire season with a back injury for which she underwent surgery in January 2022.

On Dec. 1 Fudd suffered a foot injury forced her out of the lineup for 11 games. It was the first major injury of Fudd’s career at UConn though she had torn the ACL and MCL in her right knee in high school. And just four days later UConn star Paige Bueckers suffered a tibial plateau fracture that kept her out of 19 games for the Huskies.

While the team remained relatively healthy through January and February. But come the postseason Dorka Juhász fractured her wrist in the Elite Eight which kept her out of the Final Four. UConn made the national championship game but lost to South Carolina.

2022-23 season:

UConn’s injury problems during the 2022-23 season can be summed up with one incident: The Huskies had to postpone their game against DePaul in early January due to a lack of healthy players.

It all started in August when Bueckers tore her ACL which caused her to miss the entirety of the season. Then in October freshman Ice Brady dislocated her patella tendon which ended her season before it started.

Mere months after fracturing her wrist Juhász suffered a broken thumb on Nov. 19 which kept her out of seven games. Then on Dec. 4 Fudd suffered a knee injury that initially kept her out of nine games. She made her return in January only to reinjure the same knee on Jan. 15 and miss an additional 13 games.

Meanwhile Caroline Ducharme missed 14 games due to a concussion suffered on Jan. 3. Given that the team struggled with injuries all season UConn never could find a groove and bowed out of the NCAA tournament in the Sweet 16 – the Huskies’ first time not making the Elite Eight since 2005.

2023-24 season:

To start the new season UConn is still without Patterson who had surgery on her knee in the offseason. And both El Alfy and Fudd are out for year. Plus Caroline Ducharme has missed the team’s last two games with neck and back spasms with no timeline for her return as of Dec. 1.

The No. 11 Huskies are 4-2 to start the season with a top-25 battle against No. 10 Texas up next at 3 p.m. ET Sunday on ABC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vYnVpbHRpbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvc29mdHdhcmUtY29tcGFuaWVzLWluLWJhbmdhbG9yZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,25 Software Companies in Bangalore to Know,"Bangalore or Bengaluru is often referred to as the Silicon Valley of India due to all of the software and IT companies that have chosen to operate in the city.

That Loss & Damage Fund which has secured US$420 million in pledges will be hosted at the World Bank for four years – with money used to help emerging economies repair damage and improve their defences against drought flooding and rising sea levels.

A US$30 billion climate fund was announced by the COP28 Presidency backed by global asset managers BlackRock TPG and Brookfield. Called ALTÉRRA the fund will focus on scaling climate change solutions and hopes to mobilise US$250 billion by 2030.

Staying with finance The UAE Declaration on a Global Climate Finance Framework was launched looking to make climate finance more accessible and affordable.

According to the OECD developed countries have finally met their US$100 billion pledge on climate financing – albeit three years later than originally planned.

While these pledges and commitments are welcome there is a growing sense that it could be too little too late. COP28 is the first Global Stocktake and results are worrying.

KENT Wash. — Haizar Nassir has been running Kent’s Byblos Mediterranean Market for about a year and a half. The market serves a critical need for the city’s Arabic community he says and customers with ties from across the Middle East are able to pick up a little reminder of home.

“A lot of people come here they say 'Oh we’ve been looking for this stuff!'” he said.

However the market relies on the internet for many of its functions from taking sales to running the security cameras. So when the market lost internet access on Thursday Nassir said it was a big deal.

“When we opened up the store when we saw the internet is down…I was like we’re going to have a really hard time today” he said.

According to Comcast a cable wire was vandalized cutting service just before 5 a.m. Thursday morning and leaving more than 2000 customers without internet access.

Service wouldn’t be restored until 3 a.m. Friday morning.

Nassir said the outage cost him a lot of business because many of his customers don’t carry cash on hand. Customers had to either leave or take food without paying.

“Some of them don’t understand and say 'go get internet!' We do have Internet but it’s down” he explained. “We had a lot of leftover food yesterday because … it’s the end of the day and lot of people don’t have cash.”

Nassir said this isn’t the first time his shop has lost internet access and hopes Comcast can do more to provide reliable service.

He also said that after 15 years of living in Kent he’s noticed an increased police presence and wonders if Kent Police Department officers will be able to track down the vandals.

“Two months ago two shootings happened at the same time one in this place and one in the plaza across the street. Two shootings! So sometimes it’s really hard for them to catch everything” he said. “I think they’re doing their job but it’s so messy here.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZS1uZXR3b3JrLmNvbS90ZWxlY29tL2FsdGljZS11c2EtYXBwb2ludHMtZXhlY3MtbmV3LWNvbnN1bWVyLWFuZC1idXNpbmVzcy1kaXZpc2lvbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Altice USA appoints execs for new consumer and business divisions,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.fierce-network.com/telecom/altice-usa-appoints-execs-new-consumer-and-business-divisions on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZpZXJjZS1uZXR3b3JrLmNvbS90ZWxlY29tL2FsdGljZS11c2EtYXBwb2ludHMtZXhlY3MtbmV3LWNvbnN1bWVyLWFuZC1idXNpbmVzcy1kaXZpc2lvbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iY2Rmdy5jb20vbmV3cy9idXNpbmVzcy9mcmlzY28tdW5pdmVyc2FsLXBhcmtzLXNoYXJlLW5ldy1kZXRhaWxzLWFib3V0LWtpZHMtcmVzb3J0LWNvbWluZy1pbi0yMDI2LzM0MDE0ODgv0gF9aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubmJjZGZ3LmNvbS9uZXdzL2J1c2luZXNzL2ZyaXNjby11bml2ZXJzYWwtcGFya3Mtc2hhcmUtbmV3LWRldGFpbHMtYWJvdXQta2lkcy1yZXNvcnQtY29taW5nLWluLTIwMjYvMzQwMTQ4OC8_YW1wPTE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Frisco Universal share new details about family kids theme park and resort coming in 2026,"Universal Destinations & Experiences revealed Friday new details about the theme park being built in Frisco including the park's official name -- Universal Kids Resort.

In January the company announced it was bringing a family-focused theme park and a 300-room themed resort hotel to North Texas. On Friday executives with Universal Destinations & Experiences a division of Comcast NBCUniversal the parent company of NBC 5 confirmed Friday they'd received zoning approval to move the project forward and announced the park's official name.

We're designing the resort so kids and families can feel the thrill of being physically immersed in their most beloved stories and characters. Molly Murphy Universal Creative

The theme park will be the company's first park designed specifically for families with young children catering to riders up to 46 inches tall.

“The whole resort will have a very lush landscape feel and we have buffer trees” pointed out Page Thompson president of new ventures for Universal Destinations & Experiences.

""The characters that children in this community will grow up loving and get see and touch and be around every single day it's going to grow into being the very essence of growing up and living in Frisco"" said Frisco Mayor Jeff Cheney.

The final rendering presented Friday morning differs from the original vision proposed in January 2023 (compare the January and December renderings below).

The footprint is about one-quarter the size of the parks in Orlando scaled smaller to be more ""intimate and engaging"" for younger guests. The company said in January the theme park will have a completely different look feel and scale compared to Universal’s existing parks but will still carry the same quality as the larger resort destinations.

The city estimates Universal Kids Resort will generate $200 million in annual spending in Frisco.

Molly Murphy president of Universal Creative described the park’s design as one with young children in mind.

“We’ll have playful shows meet-and-greets fun food and beverage. We’re designing it with the unbridled creativity of children in mind” said Murphy. “From a kid’s perspective. What does it look feel smell taste like? Tapping into their imagination and their sense of discovery and play.”

Cheney added Friday that the road leading into the park will be named Universal Parkway.

NBC 5 News Frisco will name the road in front of Universal Kids Resort after the company -- Universal Parkway.

City leaders and Universal executives spoke of their dedication to including the community in the process.

“Honestly this was probably the longest zoning case ever done for a project of this magnitude” said Cheney to the audience.

Residents attended community and city council meetings voicing their concerns over the proposed theme park including its size increased traffic and the potential impact on crime.

“Concerns came up about traffic but as we started showing [residents] how the roads were going to be increased to have the flow the community was very supportive of the project” said Cheney.

Some residents of the Cobb Hill neighborhood which is next to the proposed site were among the vocal opponents fearing home values would be impacted and that homes in their subdivision would become short-term rentals for visitors.

The company broke ground on the park in November and expects vertical construction to begin early in 2024. Construction crews were seen Friday building a section of cinderblock wall lining the entrance to Cobb Hill enclosing a section of the subdivision previously open. The project is expected to take about two years to complete and will bring about 2500 construction jobs to the area."

And let’s say it was not so much a “one-two punch” as “a punch and then a pat on the back.”

So first the punch: on manufacturing. The Institute for Supply Management’s Purchasing Managers Index for November came in flat worse than expected in “contractionary” territory for a 13th straight month. New orders employment inventories were all down.

Now the “pat on the back”: construction spending for October. The Commerce Department reports it was up 0.6% from September up more than 10% from a year ago.

You’d think the Fed’s rate hikes a struggling housing market and a slowing economy would hurt both sectors. Let’s figure it out.

High interest rates and a slowing global economy have been challenging for U.S. manufacturers. Bill Adams at Comerica Bank said there’s a lot of uncertainty: about what consumers will do and how much stuff businesses that sell to them will need.

“Businesses are being more cautious in managing their purchases. Supply chains are functioning much better than during the pandemic. But that also means businesses aren’t maintaining precautionarily high levels of inventories” Adams said.

And higher interest rates make a lot of manufactured goods more expensive — from business equipment to home appliances to cars and trucks said Beth Ann Bovino at U.S. Bank.

“Auto manufacturing — hit by labor strikes but also weakness from higher borrowing costs as pent-up demand starts to be exhausted” Bovino said.

Meanwhile over in the “construction” aisle of the economy it’s a whole different story.

“Fantastic” said Tony Libert describing the business environment right now. He’s a 60-year-old construction electrician in Madison Wisconsin.

“We’re very healthy. The work outlook up here looks great for the next several years” Libert said. His union’s apprenticeship program is filling up and there’s lots of work building hospitals nursing homes retirement communities.

That squares with the story of strong housing demand nationwide said Danushka Nanayakkara at the National Association of Home Builders.

“The housing market is poised for gains for 2024. There’s a large amount of multifamily units under construction right now — over a million units” Nanayakkara said.

Also a lot of factories accounting for nearly half the growth in construction spending this year said Bill Adams.

“So even though manufacturers are pretty cautious about the outlook for the next couple of months they are investing in production capacity for the next 10 and 20 and 30 years” Adams said.

A lot of that’s thanks to the CHIPS Act and federal spending on electric vehicle technology and infrastructure.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vcHJvZmVzc2lvbmFsL2luc2lnaHRzL21hcmtldHMvMjAyNC1vdXRsb29rLXVzLXJlZ2lvbmFsLWJhbmtzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2024 outlook: US regional banks | Insights,"This analysis is by Bloomberg Intelligence Senior Analyst Herman Chan and Associate Analyst Sergio Ferreira.

Following bank failures and aggressive interest-rate hikes regional lenders face headwinds in higher funding costs muted lending tougher regulation and weakening credit quality. With the rising rate cycle nearing an end net-interest margins could reach a bottom over the next few quarters while potential rate cuts in 2024 would ease deposit pressure. Though valuations reflect uncertainty and weaker earnings profiles sentiment may be improving if inflation continues to dissipate and longer-term yields retreat. Banks that have weathered more rate and deposit challenges like KeyCorp Comerica and Western Alliance could benefit from this scenario.

(WO) – On Friday Dec. 1 the Norwegian Minister of Petroleum and Energy Terje Aasland visited the Ekofisk Complex with partner companies contractors and authorities celebrating the start-up of the Tommeliten A natural gas and condensate field in the North Sea.

All the visitors were given a tour of Ekofisk. Representatives from partner companies contractors the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate as well as local authorities took part in the celebration.

The Tommeliten A field started production on Oct.13 delivering natural gas to Europe nearly six months earlier than scheduled.

Tommeliten A is a development with two subsea templates in the North Sea tied back to the Ekofisk Complex. The total resource potential is estimated in the range of 120-180 MMboe mainly comprising of natural gas (approx. 70%) and condensate (approx. 30%).

As operator of the Tommeliten A Unit ConocoPhillips Skandinavia AS has an ownership interest of 28.1385% while PGNiG Upstream Norway AS has 42.1978% TotalEnergies EP Norge AS has 20.1430% Vår Energi ASA has 9.0907% ConocoPhillips (U.K.) Holdings Limited has 0.2109% TotalEnergies E&P UK Limited has 0.1510% and ENI UK Limited has 0.0681%.

Tommeliten A (PL 044) was discovered in 1977. It is a fractured chalk field containing gas condensate and volatile oil. The field consists of an Ekofisk Formation and a Tor Formation similar to surrounding fields in the Greater Ekofisk Area. The field is a U.K.-Norway trans-boundary field as it extends from Norwegian Block 1/9 into U.K. Block 30/20. The development plan is based on the Norwegian PDO.

""It is great celebrating that the Tommeliten A field is in operation delivering gas to Europe. Earlier production start-up is the result of good and efficient cooperation with our partners contractors and the authorities"" said Steinar Våge ConocoPhillips’ President for Europe Middle East and North Africa.

The total capital investment for the project was approximately NOK 13 billion enabling about 5000 jobs during the project period. Most of the contracts were awarded to Norwegian businesses.

ConocoPhillips Australia confirmed in a statement on Friday that the 2017-built LNG vessel was moved from the facility following approval from Australian Maritime Safety Authority.

Earlier this week the loaded LNG tanker owned by a joint venture of MOL Cosco Shipping and Sinopec had lost power at the terminal’s jetty and was unable to leave.

“The ship has been moved to outer anchorage from Gladstone Harbour for further repairs by the ship owner in accordance with regulators’ safety orders” ConocoPhillips Australia said.

ConocoPhillips as downstream operator will now focus on safely bringing the LNG facility back into operation to resume LNG production it said.

Three LNG cargoes

Shareholder and upstream APLNG operator Origin Energy said in a separate statement that it will start ramping up production to return the flow of gas to the LNG facility to normal levels.

Origin which is subject to a takeover offer from a consortium consisting of Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management and a unit of US-based energy investor EIG expects the LNG facility to recommence loading operations overnight.

“In total three LNG cargoes were unable to be loaded during this event” the company said.

Origin currently owns a 22.5 percent in the APLNG project while Sinopec owns a 25 percent share in the project.

US energy giant ConocoPhillips has a 47.5 percent share in the APLNG project and operates the 9 mtpa LNG export facility on Curtis Island near Gladstone.

However ConocoPhillips revealed plans in March to become upstream operator of APLNG following the closing of EIG’s transaction with Origin and it has also agreed to purchase up to an additional 2.49 percent shareholding interest in APLNG for $0.5 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZG4uY29tL2J1c2luZXNzLWVjb25vbXkvZW5lcmd5LzIwMjMvMTIvMDEvanVkZ2UtcmVqZWN0cy1jYWxscy10by1oYWx0LXdpbnRlci1jb25zdHJ1Y3Rpb24td29yay1vbi13aWxsb3ctb2lsLXByb2plY3QtZHVyaW5nLWFwcGVhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Judge rejects calls to halt winter construction work on Willow oil project during appeal,"This 2019 aerial photo provided by ConocoPhillips shows an exploratory drilling camp at the proposed site of the Willow oil project on Alaska's North Slope. (ConocoPhillips via AP)

A federal judge in Alaska on Friday rejected requests from environmental groups to halt winter construction work for the massive Willow oil project on Alaska’s North Slope while the groups’ legal fight over the drilling project wages on.

U.S. District Court Judge Sharon Gleason just last month upheld the Biden administration’s approval in March of the ConocoPhillips Alaska project in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska and dismissed lawsuits brought by environmentalists and a grassroots Iñupiat group challenging Willow’s approval.

Those groups are appealing that decision and asked Gleason to block winter construction work planned by ConocoPhillips Alaska while the appeal is pending. She denied those requests Friday.

Gleason said that while environmental impacts related to winter activities are of “legitimate concern” to the groups “only a small area of the Reserve will be impacted.”

She wrote that the “strong legislative support at both the state and federal levels to proceed with the 2023-2024 winter construction activities tips strongly against the issuance of an injunction pending appeal.”

The lawsuits raised concerns about greenhouse gas emissions from Willow and argued federal agencies failed to consider how increased emissions from the project could affect ice-reliant species such as the polar bear Arctic ringed seals and bearded seals which already are experiencing disruptions due to climate change.

Willow has widespread political support in Alaska and many Alaska Native leaders on the North Slope and groups with ties to the region say Willow is economically vital for their communities. But climate activists have said allowing the project to proceed flies in the face of President Joe Biden’s pledges to combat climate change. The administration has defended its climate record.

While ConocoPhillips Alaska had proposed five drilling sites the U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved three which it said would include up to 199 total wells. The project could produce up to 180000 barrels of oil a day at its peak.

The company has begun prepacking ice roads and plans to begin surface-disturbing activities such as gravel mining and pipeline construction as early as Dec. 21 though the exact timing depends on weather conditions said Rebecca Boys a company spokesperson.

Erik Grafe an attorney with Earthjustice which represents several environmental groups in one of the cases said Gleason’s decision was disappointing.

Significantly high institutional ownership implies ConocoPhillips' stock price is sensitive to their trading actions

The top 18 shareholders own 50% of the company

Insiders have been selling lately

If you want to know who really controls ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 82% ownership. Put another way the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).

Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight especially with individual investors. Therefore a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.

Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of ConocoPhillips beginning with the chart below.

View our latest analysis for ConocoPhillips

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About ConocoPhillips?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register especially if they are growing.

As you can see institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in ConocoPhillips. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of ConocoPhillips (below). Of course keep in mind that there are other factors to consider too.

Institutional investors own over 50% of the company so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in ConocoPhillips. Looking at our data we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group Inc. with 9.3% of shares outstanding. BlackRock Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.3% of common stock and State Street Global Advisors Inc. holds about 4.7% of the company stock.

After doing some more digging we found that the top 18 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of ConocoPhillips

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of ConocoPhillips. Being so large we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively they own US$144m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public-- including retail investors -- own 18% stake in the company and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand ConocoPhillips better we need to consider many other factors. For instance we've identified 3 warning signs for ConocoPhillips (1 is potentially serious) that you should be aware of.

But ultimately it is the future not the past that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

A joint investigation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and the North American Electric Reliability Corp (NERC) found that Elliott was the fifth winter event in 11 years where blackouts threatened the electric grid.

One of the problems was that the wells in the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations which hold large reserves of natural gas froze at the height of the storm slashing production by more than half in some instances.

The plunging natural gas supply significantly reduced the pressure in interstate pipelines that supply New York City via its utility Con Edison.

Con Edison was forced to limit the supply of gas to some customers and bring online a liquefied natural gas plant.

3 Extremely low temperatures caused large reserves of natural gas to freeze last year forcing Con Edison to limit the supply to certain customers. Dan Cappellazzo

Had it not taken those steps regulators concluded that Con Edison “could have faced an unprecedented loss of its entire system that in this worst case scenario would have taken months to restore” according to the assessment.

The outage would have left more than a million of the power company’s customers in New York City and nearby areas without heat “while the outside temperature was in the single digits for months.”

“We narrowly dodged a crisis last year. Had the weather not warmed up on Christmas Day it is highly likely that natural gas service would have been disrupted to New York City” said NERC president and CEO Jim Robb.

Regulators urged US Congress and state lawmakers to establish reliability rules for natural gas infrastructure covering cold weather preparedness regional coordination and critical infrastructure.

“Someone must have authority to establish and enforce gas reliability standards” said FERC chairman Willie Phillips stressing the need to protect fuel supply to natural gas-fired power plants during extreme cold weather.

The FERC and NERC also recommended better enforcement of standards technical review of outages to identify precautions improved communication between gas distributors and grid operators and studying the need for more gas infrastructure.

Elliott resulted in at least 28 deaths and left hundreds of thousands of people on the East Coast without power. Nearly two-thirds of the US was under extreme weather warnings leading to unexpected energy generation supply losses.

As the temperatures outside plunged and the demand for heat spiked 18 percent of the entire country’s gas generators failed either because of technical glitches or a lack of fuel.

The regulators’ 168-page report published last month notes that it was “especially disconcerting that it happened in the Eastern Interconnection which normally has ample generation and transmission ties to other grid operators that allow them to import and export power.”

3 Sometimes it’s not just snow that can cause issues. December 23 2022 saw devastating flooding in the Rockaways. Paul Martinka

Nearly a year after Winter Storm Elliot much of the US power grid is still at an increased risk of having insufficient energy supplies to meet higher demand in extreme conditions — a worrying prospect in light of forecasts predicting that this winter will be colder and snowier than the last in many parts of the US.

In a separate 2023-2024 Winter Reliability Assessment released by NERC on Nov. 8 the regulators warned that while power grids can handle normal winter conditions “any prolonged wide-area cold snaps will be challenging due to generator outages and fuel vulnerability.”

“Extreme cold weather events can cause electricity demand to deviate significantly from historical forecasts” said Mark Olson NERC’s manager of reliability assessments. “The growth of intermittent resources like solar generation on the distribution system significantly increases load forecasting complexity and uncertainty.”

“Once again we strongly recommend that operators take the necessary steps to prepare for winter” he added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sb2h1ZC5jb20vc3Rvcnkvc3BvcnRzL2hpZ2gtc2Nob29sL2Zvb3RiYWxsLzIwMjMvMTIvMDEvY29uLWVkaXNvbi1hdGhsZXRlLW9mLXRoZS13ZWVrLXNvbWVycy1mb290YmFsbC1yeWFuLWNvbGUvNzE3NDY1OTYwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Con Edison Athlete of the Week: Somers football's Ryan Cole,"Name: Ryan Cole

Development activities in PNW’s service territories will improve the company’s overall performance.



However this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has to face risks related to any unplanned outages in its nuclear generation facilities.

Tailwinds

Pinnacle West has a capital investment plan of $5.45 billion for 2023-2025 at an average annual growth rate of 5-7%. PNW expects transmission investments of $315 million for 2023 up nearly 45% from the year-ago level. The company projects long-term retail customer growth of 1.5-2.5% and weather-normalized retail electricity sales growth of 4.5-6.5%.



PNW anticipates new investments and establishment of businesses to increase demand for its services. Taiwan Semiconductor has increased its investment from $12 billion to $40 billion for the new projects. These projects when fully constructed will create a working space of nearly 3 million square feet and generate demand for electricity.



The company is using new technology to provide high-quality services to customers. It is also working toward obtaining cost savings which will help keep customer rates low.



Pinnacle West continues to focus on enhancing its renewable capacity. During 2023-2025 the company is expected to invest nearly $1.31 billion in boosting clean power generation. The company will develop 1600 megawatts of clean energy and storage that are expected to be placed in service by 2024 for Arizona Public Service Company customers.

Headwinds

Potential volatility in market prices of fuel electricity and other renewable energy commodities could create operational risks for the company. Pinnacle West has nuclear generation facilities that need to undergo thorough safety security and other licensing requirements. The company will be affected by any unplanned outage in nuclear plants stemming from safety concerns and unexpected production stoppage.

Moreover if planned maintenance outages of the nuclear units continue longer than expected it will adversely impact production and operations.

Which is why your humble Hop Take columnist likes Friday Beers’ odds.

Or I guess I should say @almostfriday’s odds turning the success of @FridayBeers into Friday Beers a new brand attempting to span the digital and analog divide wi— actually you know what? Let’s back up a bit.

A couple years ago reporting this feature for VinePair about how the then-booming hard seltzer segment was changing the cultural institution of the college kegger among America’s vaguely drinking-age youth sources kept bringing up an Instagram account called @FridayBeers. The meme account is an outgrowth of @AlmostFriday founded by the brother-preneur trio Jack Max and Sam Barrett in 2019.

Don't Miss A Drop Get the latest in beer wine and cocktail culture sent straight to your inbox.

That page’s stock-in-trade like @FridayBeers and the other dozen-plus social media brands it has since spawned is observational comedy about the life times and vices of America’s bros. Among other things @FridayBeers is a tremendous exercise in world-building: If you’ve ever heard someone say “Commence suckdown” before necking a tallboy or been baffled by a reference to someone called “Dooley” you’ve touched the void the @FridayBeers universe in the wild. “Think about Barstool Sports” says Ernest Wilkins a Chicago-based writer and marketing director who “tracks the creator ecosystem.” “Now take that layer of scuzz booze bloat and Zyn pouch residue off add a more… I don’t wanna say ‘safer’ veneer to it [but] that’s the brand.”

The Barretts now operate this heady menagerie as Almost Friday Media (AFM) a digitally native production company that they say generates 800 million impressions a month. In lay terms AFM makes videos posts them to social media and a shitload of people watch ‘em.

“The words ‘Friday Beers’ in terms of what it represents on a cultural level are far beyond the idea of drinking beer” says Jack Barrett AFM’s chief executive in a recent phone call describing the popularity of the brand and its ascendance with today’s vice-addled undergrads. “We just became this lifestyle brand.”

That isn’t noteworthy on face. One off-cited 2020 study by the market research firm SignalFire shows that more 50 million people worldwide consider themselves creators; this past spring Goldman Sachs reported that 50 million people worked under the moniker. The bank’s analysts estimate the “total addressable market” (i.e. the overall opportunity) at $250 billion this year and project it jumping to $480 billion by 2027 fueled by subscription fees hoodie sales and sponcon contracts. For comparison the Brewers Association estimates the U.S. beer market is currently worth around $115 billion and as we often discuss things are not exactly looking up at the moment.

Hopefully this all helps you grasp why investors put $6 million into AFM in 2022 why Hollywood’s powerful William Morris Endeavor agency now represents its talent and why I’m writing a beer column about its new private-label beer.

While creators have been shaking up the ad landscape cashing in on private-label goods and even launching ghost restaurants they’ve only begun to dip their toes into the beverage-alcohol industry. In 2022 I reported for VinePair on creators (née influencers) on the vanguard of the booze business arguing that brands like Happy Dad (a hard seltzer line launched by the NELK Boys a super-popular YouTube collective) represented an extremely lucrative new form of drinks marketing wherein the brand the production house and the ad inventory are all owned by the same people.

Now AFM is following in those footsteps. Having already executed marketing campaigns for New Belgium Boston Beer Company and Anheuser-Busch InBev the company earlier this month launched Friday Beers a light adjunct lager brewed by upstate New York’s venerable F.X. Matt Brewing Company.

The beer which is currently only available in select Massachusetts markets and the company’s branded bar in Nashville (Almost Friday Sporting Club) “tastes insane” promises Barrett.

“I knew we’re going to be selling the message [of the @FridayBeers’ brand] but if people bought it and they tried it and it tastes as good as Michelob Ultra tastes or as Coors Light tastes then there’s some real chance that it can stick around” he says. At 120 calories to Michelob Ultra’s 95 it’s a bit heavy for its set but Barrett is confident that @FridayBeers’ audience isn’t the type that minds. “The calories aren’t gonna matter for our drinker” he says.

I haven’t tasted the beer but after covering the industry for a dozen years I think Barrett’s assessment is right on. Taste is table stakes and nutritional profile matters to an extent but marketing is where the magic happens in the beer business. AFM doesn’t “control the pipes” through which its media empire reaches all those eyeballs — those belong to Instagram TikTok and YouTube. But it controls every other promotional lever that a beer company needs to succeed from powerful branding expertise to name-brand talent (ish; I have yet to meet another 35-year-old who knows who Rusty Featherstone is) to promotional channels that would otherwise cost third-party firms an arm and a leg.

(Yes yes distribution is key too. But given the proof-positive of other creators’ incursions into the booze business over the past 18 months or so and the expertise of Friday Beers’ joint-venture partner Jay Harman Cisco Brewing Company’s founder and chief executive the brand should find literal and figurative purchase in the middle tier.)

Speaking of those third-party brands: How do they feel about all this? After all AFM’s Voodoo Ranger and Sam Adams campaigns feature prominently in marketing materials Barrett shared with Hop Take and Bud Light and Natural Light are former clients too. (Boston Beer Co. didn’t respond to a request for comment; a Voodoo Ranger spokesperson says the brand has “had [a] ton of fun with AFM as business partners over the past several months” and hopes to “share the love and enjoy their new release someday soon too.”) Barrett says ABI had even initially approached the firm to license a beer in 2021 though the project fell apart in mid-2022 over the macrobrewer’s growing discomfort with the AFM brands’ content pertaining to binge drinking. He claims that at one point ABI requested he take down a post involving Will Ferrell’s funnel-toting “Frank the Tank” character from “Old School.” (When I asked ABI for comment a spokesperson promised to “follow up” but provided no response before deadline.)

In fairness to ABI — which has had a hell of a year where social media partnerships are concerned — a lot of the memes and original content that AFM’s brands publish toe the line between satire and celebration of substance use. (For example.) AFM says 77.6 percent of its audience is between 25 and 34 with just 6.2 percent at 18–21 and 0.1 percent below 17. That puts it safely above the Beer Institute’s ad code benchmark requirement that beer marketing can “only be [done] where the audience for the placement is expected to be at least 73.8 percent adults of legal drinking age.” Still the strictures of selling alcohol are considerable compared to say bucket hats (which @FridayBeers also hawks) and earnest though he strikes me Barrett is a little out of his depth on the difference.

“We’re following all of the… I’ll call them regulations.… We obviously have to learn more about it but the way you market a beer… We started another Instagram account @Drink.Friday.Beers which is where we market beer through” he says stumbling a bit. This is probably a good idea. But that account’s bio features the brand’s #CommenceSuckdown slogan and no minimum age statement plus some content chugging and shotgunning that’d give agida to a mid-size craft brewer’s general counsel let alone a macrobrewer’s. None of this is out-of-bounds per se but it’s not exactly risk-averse either. Beer brands that plan to “stick around” hew to the latter standard.

Whether AFM can find a way to consistently market Friday Beers to its considerable legal-drinking-age audience without running afoul of industry watchdogs as it grows is I think an existential question — or the existential question. What else derails this brand? It’s already built! Sure the regulatory pitfalls are there and AFM has to get more sophisticated about them. But the upside is enormous and Barrett insists he’s up for the challenge. “This only succeeds if we really fuel it to grow” he says. I’m not betting against it.

According to coverage from Rochester First a Tom McCorry of upstate New York has been arrested for “criminal impersonation” for sending threatening emails and letters that “were claimed to have been written by Investigator Richard Harder.” That a guy is allegedly doing crimes under the name Detective Dick Harder is weird as hell but it would typically be well beyond our Hop-ocalyptic scope. Except: Beer Marketer’s Insights reported in its newsletter Wednesday that this Tom McCorry appears to be the same Tom McCorry who has worked for Constellation Brands for some two decades and currently serves as the senior vice president of finance of the firm’s beer division. “Our team is working to understand more about this matter” the firm which is based in upstate NY told BMI in a statement.

(Photo provided by Constellation )

He did the eye-catching task of smooching a nuclear dry cask storage facility within the Dresden Generating Station facility and hopes the moment caught on video proves a potent point.

Kyle Hill who has gained popularity for his professionally produced YouTube videos recently unveiled his most recent installment at the local Morris facility in early November. In the first three-and-a-half weeks of the video’s upload Hill’s almost 20-minute video has been viewed more than 741000 times. It can be viewed at https://youtu.be/lhHHbgIy9jU?si=ybyipvhYV44AWVd5.

The mini-documentary which was filmed under heavy scrutiny gives a rare glimpse inside the Grundy County facility which started running in 1960.

“I do all this to prove a point” Hill who has visited the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear power plant sites said toward the end of the video. “And that point is this: The world looks different when you understand it and nuclear power and waste when you understand it looks less dangerous and more promising than ever.”

In an interview with the Morris Herald-News Hill said the Dresden video – aptly titled “I Kissed Nuclear Waste to Prove a Point” – was filmed during a visit in July after extensive background checks and clearances.

The White House’s Office of Nuclear Energy had to sign off on the visit. Officials from Constellation Energy which operates Dresden Station also put Hill through a battery of tests.

“Obviously you cant just waltz into a working power plant” Hill said. “Getting inside Dresden involved background checks many Zoom calls and many months of planning. Once I was there we were scanned for radiation our footage was screened and armed guards followed us at all times.”

Paul Dempsey a spokesman with Constellation said company representatives took note of Hill’s volume of work.

“We researched Kyle’s video archive and were impressed with his fact-based approach to teaching viewers about a topic” Dempsey said. “He addresses misconceptions head-on and has a great way of teaching about a topic without getting too caught up in complicated language.”

The YouTube video explained some of the various features within the Dresden site including pools of water within the facility where nuclear power is piled that reportedly is cleaner than drinking water. Hill also walks among the 16-foot-tall dry cask storage towers that are able to withstand missile strikes.

Nuclear power which like wind and solar is carbon-free is an important source of everyday life despite what advocates deem as having many misconceptions among the general public.

Today nuclear power is linked to about 20% of the electricity powering the U.S.

Hill said he hopes viewers of his creations ponder deeper questions about their overall environment.

“Here’s a powerful question: Where is all the waste that a nuclear power plant produces? It’s on-site either in pools or nearly indestructible casks” Hill said. “[Constellation] likes to say that they can account for every neutron. Now ask yourself the same question of fossil fuels. Where is the pollution that your local coal plant produces?”

While epic nuclear disasters of the past such as Chernobyl and Fukushima resonate most Hill in his latest video notes they are an anomaly.

For his part Dempsey said he hopes viewers see Dresden Station “as just another place of business” that employs an array of “seasoned professionals.”

“The attention to detail and strict governance by procedure is very important to Constellation” Dempsey said. “Every task starts with a pre-job brief hat includes a safety component. A job can be stopped if any issue arises that needs further discussion.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY2EvMjAyMy8xMi8wMS9pcy1jb25zdGVsbGF0aW9uLXNvZnR3YXJlLXN0b2NrLXdvcnRoLWEtYnV5LWluLWRlY2VtYmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Constellation Software Stock Worth a Buy in December?,"Constellation stock (TSX:CSU) is up 46% in the last year alone but after an earnings miss should investors still consider the stock?

If you’re an investor looking to the future you’re likely starting to keep your eye out on some growth stocks. You may be eying stocks that others aren’t exactly rushing to invest cash into yet. Though I don’t know if that’s the case if you’re considering Constellation Software (TSX:CSU).

Even so Constellation stock has made enormous growth in the last year. In fact in the last decade! So let’s look at whether this stock now over $3000 per share is still worth a buy in December.

First some history

Constellation stock has been around since the birthplace of the internet in 1995. However it went public back in 2006. Since then the diversified software company has grown to tens of thousands of employees. The company has grown thanks to its incredible strategy of acquiring software companies and holding them long term.

Since being founded the company has acquired over 500 businesses. Most of these acquisitions are pretty small less than $5 million for instance. However sometimes larger acquisitions will be pursued if the value is there.

Management has certainly proven that it can identify that value seeing shares rise 13221% since coming on the market as of writing! Even so the company has managed to remain a top choice as other competition has edged in. So let’s see how it has done lately.

Earnings miss but still climbing

Constellation earnings actually missed estimates during the latest quarter. And yet shares still climbed past that $3000 mark. In fact the share price continues to climb even today. So let’s look over earnings to see what investors were so excited about.

In the quarter revenue increased 23% year-over-year with 8% from organic growth. This brought revenue to $2.1 billion compared to $1.7 billion the year before. Net income also increased 30% to $177 million compared to $136 million in 2022 with cash flows up a whopping 60% to $513 million.

The company continued its path of acquisitions completing the acquisition of Optimal Blue business paying $201 million in cash. Additional acquisitions were also completed for aggregate cash of $187 million with deferred payments adding up to a total of $223 million. So all in all the company was business as usual with major growth across the board.

Analysts weigh in

Analysts continued to believe that Constellation stock would outpeform on the market pushing price targets up even further. The solid quarter and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) especially impressed them with 39% year-over-year growth.

There were also multiple operational improvements during the quarter that impressed analysts. They included better organic growth as mentioned as well as higher core margins. So even though some thought revenue was a bit on the light side this was more a reflection of the time rather than company performance.

So as Constellation stock continues its business as usual it seems as though there is more growth ahead for those investing in the stock. Shares are now up 46% in the last year but given what we’ve seen they should rise even higher in the years to come.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuZXQuY29tL2hvbWUvZW5lcmd5LWFuZC11dGlsaXRpZXMvZW5lcmd5LWRlcmVndWxhdGlvbi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,You Can Choose Your Electricity Provider in These States With Deregulated Markets,"The power of choice is a wonderful thing. And depending on where you live you may be able to choose your electric provider.

It's called energy deregulation and about 40% of US states have it. Through what's commonly known as retail choice in deregulated states residents have a say in where they get their electricity. In these states energy suppliers function a bit like any other business: Competitors provide options and residents choose how to spend their money.

In regulated markets however electricity comes from a designated utility provider and you don't have a choice. Regulated energy markets create a form of monopoly meaning no competitors to choose from or switch to and the public utility is still regulated by the state government.

Which method is most beneficial for the people? Which states have it right?

""It's a question of whether you believe that a free-market environment is best for consumers or that a regulated monopoly is best for consumers"" Joshua Basseches an assistant professor of public policy and environmental studies at Tulane University told CNET.

Here's what you need to know about energy deregulation how it works and whether your state offers you the option to choose.

For more information on deregulated energy rates and companies check out CNET partner site ChooseEnergy.com which like CNET is owned by Red Ventures.

What is energy deregulation and how does it work?

Energy deregulation refers to a utility system of retail choice where different companies other than the existing energy utility are able to offer different packages of deals giving customers a choice of who they purchase energy from.

In states without a deregulated utility environment governing bodies manage a regulated monopoly where one company provides the utility across the state with rates and prices controlled by the government.

Whether a state is deregulated or not that particular state's utilities are managed by its public utility commission or PUC a governing body that regulates public utility rates and services. Different public utility commissions operate in different ways but their ultimate goal is to represent citizens' interests when determining utility policies.

Even in deregulated states that regulation still exists. That's why Basseches refers to deregulation as a misnomer -- instead he prefers to use the term ""restructured.""

""What's often referred to as deregulation is the difference between what's known as a vertically integrated utility monopoly enterprise -- where the utility company generates transmits and distributes electricity -- and a deregulated or restructured environment where various aspects of that supply chain are opened up to competition and only parts of the cost are regulated by the commissions"" he said.

What US states are deregulated for electricity?



Most states still have regulated utility providers. Just 18 states (and the District of Columbia) have deregulated electricity markets.

Zooey Liao/CNET

According to the US Environmental Protection Agency 13 states (and the District of Columbia) have fully deregulated or restructured electricity utilities:

Connecticut. Delaware. Massachusetts. Illinois. Maine. Maryland. New Hampshire. New Jersey. New York. Ohio. Pennsylvania. Rhode Island. Texas.

Another five states have partially deregulated or restructured environments:

California. Georgia. Michigan. Oregon. Virginia.

A brief history of energy deregulation

Beginning in the early 1900s during the early days of electricity commercialization companies began approaching state legislators to set up a regulatory compact which became the regulated utilities we know today. That system largely stayed the same until beginning with the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 or PURPA and continuing on through the 1990s a series of legislation allowed states the authority to deregulate or restructure.

But not every state decided to do so and decisions were made based on each state's belief as to what would most benefit residents. Today about 20 states have some form of deregulated or restructured system with the majority of states still working with regulated monopolies.

Deregulated vs. regulated energy markets: the pros and cons

Unfortunately there's no easy answer as to whether regulation or deregulation provides a better outcome for the everyday resident. Even for Basseches an expert who's spent the last six years on a book project about state-level renewable energy policy the issue is too complicated to come down on one side or the other.

He says it's unclear on a systematic level whether deregulation has led to decreases in electricity rates. Factors from weather to the war in Ukraine can affect those rates and even for experts it's too difficult to say definitively that one method is the right one.

""You can look at electricity prices over time and see that they've gone up and down but it's hard to attribute that"" he said. ""They've gone up and down both in restructured and traditionally regulated jurisdictions. So in cases where costs went down it's hard to say that it's because of restructuring. But what is clear is that restructuring gives consumers more choice and more direct say in what kind of electricity they want and how much they'll pay for it.""

Pros of energy deregulation

Basseches and other industry experts say deregulation proponents point to examples like the following as pros of deregulated energy:

Deregulated markets give power of choice to the consumer.

Competition should even the playing field against the power of a utility monopoly.

Utility monopolies are less focused on the consumer's best interest.

Deregulated markets tend to be more open to changes like clean energy adoption and technology improvements.

The biggest and most obvious benefit of a deregulated environment is that it gives choice to the people. In an ideal world PUCs would be trusted to provide the best option for all. But that isn't always the case and it isn't always easy for the consumer to tell. For Basseches that's what makes it a worthwhile change.

""What I like about competition is that in the absence of transparency you can have some faith that there's some check on the power of the utility monopoly by virtue of competition and market forces"" he said.

A deregulated or restructured system also takes power away from long-standing monopolies. Often providers have been in place for decades and critics say they're focused less on what's best for consumers and more on maintaining the status quo.

""What you have to worry about with a regulated monopoly is that it will be best for the monopoly company and not the consumers"" Basseches said.

Public utilities are usually behemoths that are resistant to change. Basseches says a restructured (deregulated) state can create an environment where companies are able to be more nimble and able to change. That means quicker adoption of new technology more alternatives and even better options for clean energy.

""For those who care about climate change and environmental issues it's been much easier for renewable energy to penetrate the market in deregulated environments"" he said. ""If wind and solar are the cheapest resource and you no longer have utilities owning all the generation they're not going to be fighting regulators to hold on to things that are no longer economical but that they've invested in.""

Cons of energy deregulation

Responsibility lies with the consumer.

Energy shopping experience can be complicated.

Consumer education is needed to navigate.

Competition and deregulated market creates opportunity for bad actors or scams.

In a deregulated or restructured environment the choice is with the consumers -- but so is the responsibility. Most people don't know much about public utilities or energy policy so they're required to be more informed in order to make good decisions in a deregulated system. That can lead to wasting or not fully realizing the benefits that choice provides.

""Usually if consumers don't choose an alternative they're given the default service provider which is typically the local utility"" Basseches said. ""So it does require the consumer to be more educated.""

Just because a state is deregulated doesn't mean that state's PUC is any less important. In fact in a deregulated state that commission is the only thing standing in the way of bad actors which means people and states can be taken advantage of.

""It really just depends on the vigilance of these public utility commissions"" Basseches said. ""One thing I always tell people is to pay attention to public utility commissions. If they're doing their jobs effectively they provide a safeguard against exploitation.""

How to find the best electricity provider in Texas

Basseches said Texas is ""a poster child for a fully restructured electricity sector"" and called it ""extremely restructured.""

""Restructuring is a continuum and it's very complex and multilayered"" Basseches said. ""Restructuring isn't just a switch there are different degrees. And Texas is the most restructured.""

Texas has a wider selection of providers than anywhere else in the country which is why Basseches advises residents to be as informed as possible when making their choices in ""this system on steroids."" Texas residents are likely to receive more solicitations from different suppliers and the choice can be overwhelming. His advice is simply to seek as much information as possible.

""Talk to your neighbors"" he said. ""The same way you'd make a choice about purchasing a new car talk to your neighbors talk to people you trust and know that the public utility commission works for you and your tax dollars. Don't be afraid to ask them for help.""

For more information here's the Texas PUC Facts and FAQs page and the state's government-run comparison website: Powertochoose.org. When shopping for electricity plans on any website before enrolling make sure to read through the electricity facts label aka EFL or ""fact sheet"" to learn about the details of each plan.

How to find the best electricity provider in other states

For Basseches the best first step in any state is to start with the PUCs whose websites should have information on competitive suppliers options and more.

Before making a choice be sure to read up on options understand the dynamics of the different companies involved and educate yourself on lingo pricing and more.

""Just like investing in the stock market there's going to be some risk"" Basseches said. ""But the public utility commission does work for the people and they do have the most knowledge because companies have to register with them. So my advice is to get to know your public utility commission read things carefully and know that everyone is vying for your business. Just like anything else you have to pay attention.""

Energy deregulation FAQs

What does deregulation mean in energy? Deregulation refers to a utility system of retail choice where different companies other than the existing energy utility are able to offer different packages of deals giving customers a choice of who they purchase energy from. In states with a regulated utility environment governing bodies manage a regulated monopoly where one company provides the utility across the state with rates and prices controlled by the government.

What are the disadvantages of deregulation in energy? In a deregulated or restructured environment both the choice and the responsibility lies with the consumer. Most people don't know much about public utilities or energy policy so they're required to be more informed in order to make good decisions in a deregulated system. That can lead to wasting the benefits that choice provides and can allow unethical companies to take advantage.

When was US energy deregulated? Beginning with the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 and continuing on through the 1990s a series of legislative measures gave states the authority to deregulate or restructure. Today less than half of US states have deregulated their electricity utility.

A total of eighteen filters across both the MIRI and NIRCam instruments were used in these images covering a range of wavelengths from 1.4 microns in the near-infrared to 25.5 microns in the mid-infrared. At the very center of the MIRI area is a young star system with a planet-forming disk named d203-506. The pullout at the bottom right displays a combined NIRCam and MIRI image of this young system. Its extended shape is due to pressure from the harsh ultraviolet radiation striking it. An international team of astronomers detected a new carbon molecule known as methyl cation for the first time in d203-506.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies collectively decided to implement an additional supply cut of 1 million barrels a day reinforcing Saudi Arabia's recent extension of its equivalent voluntary oil reduction.

On Nov. 1 Energy Transfer posted weaker-than-expected earnings for its third quarter.

With the recent buzz around Energy Transfer some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company’s dividends. As of now Energy Transfer offers an annual dividend yield of 9% which is a quarterly dividend amount of 31.25 cents per share ($1.25 a year).

So how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?

To earn $500 per month or $6000 annually from dividends alone you would need an investment of approximately $66672 or around 4800 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1200 per year you would need $13334 or around 960 shares.

Read This: Top 4 Defensive Stocks That You May Want To Dump In November

To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6000 or $1200) by the dividend ($1.25 in this case). So $6000 / $1.25 = 4800 ($500 per month) and $1200 / $1.25 = 960 shares ($100 per month).

Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.

How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock's current price.

For example if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50 the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However if the stock price increases to $60 the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely if the stock price falls to $40 the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).

Similarly changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend the yield will also increase provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely if the dividend payment decreases so will the yield.

The Dow ended a three-month losing streak by gaining 8.9% in November. The 30-stock blue-chip index has rallied to a record high for the year.

Similarly the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed out November with gains of 8.9% and 10.7% respectively. These two major indexes have notched their best monthly performance since July 2022. The indexes are now just 1% away from their individual 2023 highs.

All the indexes are poised to cement a year-end rally following a strong November. According to Carson Group’s chief market strategist Ryan Detrick since 1950 the S&P 500 has on average gained another 1.8% monthly following a gain of 8% or more in the prior month.

Additionally stocks saw strong returns in December following solid gains till November. Traditionally if the S&P 500 is up more than 15% till November then the broader index has ended December in the green 75% of the time according to Dow Jones Market Data.

The Nasdaq too finishes December higher 67% of the time if the tech-heavy index is up more than 20% till November. Both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq have soared 18.2% and 35% so far this year a tell-tale sign that the current momentum in the stock market will undoubtedly cement a year-end rally. What’s more stocks have historically scaled northward during the last five trading sessions in December known as the Santa Claus rally.

Now seasonal trends may not necessarily predict the future. But stocks have gained strength in recent times thanks to the likelihood of a pause in interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve amid inflation showing signs of cooling down while the U.S. economy remains buoyant. Per the CME FedWatch Tool 42.7% of the market pundits are expecting the Fed to lower interest rates by 25 basis points in the March policy meeting.

Thus with the Fed poised to curb its aggressive monetary policy coupled with strong seasonal trends the stock market is well-positioned to gain further. This calls for placing bets on sound growth stocks like Copart CPRT Pinterest PINS Arista Networks ANET CrowdStrike CRWD and Lyft LYFT.

When they learned Corning’s Spotlight Cinemas was in danger of closing its doors the couple decided to duplicate a playbook they had established to save theaters in Hornell and Warsaw — acquisition and renovations that set the stage for sustained success.

“We were somewhat familiar with the market because Hornell and Corning kind of overlap” Tami recalled. “It was easy for us to get to that theater and rehab it and work with all the staff on a weekly basis and things like that.

“Plus it’s Corning. Corning Painted Post that whole area is just lovely. People love going to that area and we just thought it was a smart decision to pick up a theater in that market.”

The Treutleins acquired the cinema at 88 Victory Highway in Painted Post on Oct. 9 and had several of the theater’s eight screens open by Oct. 13 to debut Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour film.

This weekend though is the formal launch of the rebranded Spotlight Theater of Corning with a ribbon cutting at 11 a.m. Friday and holiday-inspired promotions throughout the rest of the weekend ending with Sunday night’s showtimes.

Renovations new concessions at rebranded Spotlight Theater

Visitors to the Spotlight Theater will notice changes big and small with more on the way. Improvements include new projector lenses for better picture audio equipment repairs and HVAC replacements. Perhaps most notable for the viewer experience new seats are expected to be installed in the next month or so.

“Some auditoriums don’t have cup holders. That’s how old the seats are” Tami said.

The Spotlight Theater also features an expanded snack menu that is still growing. Single serve pizzas seven-inch cookies and walking tacos are in the works for the concessions. The theater is also expanding its availability for parties in the former arcade area.

With renovations ongoing the Treutleins opened six screens the week of Thanksgiving. The remaining two will likely come online in early 2024.

Special promotions holiday themes during grand opening weekend

Spotlight Theater is rolling out the red carpet during the grand opening weekend with step-and-repeat photo ops providing some Hollywood glamor before heading into the theater.

In addition to the latest blockbusters like “Napoleon” and “Hunger Games” the theater is adding some holiday magic with hit seasonal films that include “Arthur Christmas” “Elf” “How the Grinch Stole Christmas” and “White Christmas.” A hot chocolate bar will dial up the holiday cheer.

Tickets to new releases cost $6 while holiday films are $5 and $2 for loyalty members who will also receive surprise giveaways throughout the weekend.

Movie theater industry on the rise locally nationwide?

The eight screens at the Corning theater mark a significant expansion for the Treutleins nearly doubling the screens in Hornell and Warsaw. They’re also preparing to open another eight-screen theater in Hudson NY.

The Treutleins are bullish on the future of the theater industry. Tami said Spotlight attendance continues to rebound since the COVID-19 pandemic projecting 2023 figures to hit at least 75% of pre-pandemic levels.

“In this area of Western New York most of our attendance happens between Thanksgiving and New Year’s so that will really tell us”she said. “The writers' strike did push stuff off. Movies we were slated to have in March got moved to June of next year and things that were supposed to happen in November got moved to March. There’s been a little reworking of the whole calendar but overall nothing disappeared.”

Attendance at Spotlight theaters reflect a national trend. According to The Numbers a publicly available database of movie industry statistics annual tickets sold for 2023 are expected to reach 922 million up from 709 million in 2022.

Tami doesn’t believe the rise of streaming services will keep people out of theaters.

“Our biggest customers are people who love movies and watch movies all the time whether it’s at home or at the theater” she said. “It’s just different in this big dark space without all the demands of my house and everybody gasping at the same time.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndlbnkuY29tL3N0b3J5LzUwMTMwMjE5L2Nvcm5pbmdzLXNwYXJrbGUtcmV0dXJucy10aGlzLXdlZWtlbmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Corning's Sparkle returns this weekend,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzY29ubmVjdHMuY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy9oaWdoLXNjaG9vbC8yMDIzLzEyLzAyL3NlY3Rpb24tNC1ib3dsaW5nLXJlc3VsdHMtdG9wLXBlcmZvcm1lcnMtMjAyMy0yNC83MTY2NzI3NTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Section 4 bowling: Results top performers 2023-24,"Binghamton Press & Sun Bulletin

Global Finance: Why form strategic relationships with technology partners?

Mark Frey: We have several technology partners across our business some of which are service providers for our infrastructure needs and some that directly support our commercial organization and how we attract and create value for clients. In both categories we see it as mission critical to have true transparency and alignment in what we aim to achieve and how that partner contributes to value creation. Suppose the partner is aligned in how we define our immediate and longer-term goals; that takes us to how we can generate mutual value in terms of the commercial aspects of our relationship. Ideally we build models with partners where they benefit from our success and the more value we can derive from their capability in the marketplace the more we can generate economics they can share in. Our view is that technology and commercial partnerships work best when we are completely aligned in terms of what we’re trying to achieve and how we’ll share in the value generated.

GF: How are fintechs helping small and midsize enterprises manage foreign exchange risks?

Frey: The fintech sector has successfully improved access to financial products and services by leveraging client-centric technologies. In the B2B space there are a significant number of customer segments that have experienced a material improvement in access to financial services especially risk-management services because fintechs have taken capability down-market to small businesses and consumers in addition to building sector-specific solutions for particular industry verticals that have previously had difficulty either accessing or customizing solutions for their specific use cases. Fintechs have been successful in this democratization by leveraging technology and sector-specific applications that customize generic financial services and products to the needs of an industrial sector or segment of customers. Fintechs by definition can be more targeted in their go-to-market strategies than the big banks and often pick particular segments of the economy in which they can develop a competitive advantage. In building and deploying innovative technologies in this targeted way fintechs like us have made it economically viable to service specific segments with tailored product offerings that big banks which appeal to a broad-based audience simply can’t do at scale.

GF: How have you created a seamless FX trading solution?

Frey: When we think of FX trading and risk management we focus on organizations that move money across borders at scale in terms of absolute currency volume and the number of payments. Our focus then is to help deliver risk-management pretrade planning budgeting and strategy tools that can ultimately be executed and turned into payments to vendors or accessed in terms of incoming accounts receivable solutions. By focusing on both the FX risk-management strategy and how those FX risks can be broken down into the payments at a line-item level we have been able to create value for our clients by allowing them to streamline their planning and budgeting process while also ensuring operational efficiency in terms of actually moving or receiving FX currency. We provide tools and analysis that help clients manage their currency risk while assisting them to move money across borders at scale with precision and efficiency. We’ve focused our technology on the intersection of these two areas—leveraging technology to provide insights and reporting that leads to more timely and effective risk-management decisions with a platform that automates processes regarding the movement of funds.

GF: What are your predictions for cross-border payments and currency risks in 2024?

Frey: Regarding the big macro picture we expect that currency markets will be more volatile in the future than they have been in the past. Whether from escalating geopolitical tensions diverging interest-rate expectations per currency or a historically strong USD we expect volatility to rebound from a somewhat subdued period. The world will also get smaller and businesses will continue to look beyond their borders for expansion opportunities thereby driving cross-border payment and FX trading volumes higher in the years ahead. In short we see more risk and additional volatility but a world where businesses chasing growth aim to generate it from international rather than local markets. With this worldview in mind we’ve developed solutions and think we’re well positioned to win.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB5bW50cy5jb20vc21icy8yMDIzL2JsdWV2aW5lLXNheXMtYnVzaW5lc3MtY2hlY2tpbmctcHJvcGVscy1tYW5hZ2VkLWRlcG9zaXRzLTEtYmlsbGlvbi1kb2xsYXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bluevine Says Business Checking Propels Managed Deposits to $1 Billion,"Bluevine a digital banking platform for small businesses has surpassed $1 billion in managed deposits by its small business banking customers.

The accomplishment places Bluevine on par with the top 20% of Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.-insured banks and savings institutions in terms of deposit volume the FinTech company said in a Friday (Dec. 1) press release.

The growth of Bluevine can be attributed to its Bluevine Business Checking offering according to the release. The high-yield small- to medium-sized business (SMB) checking account which was launched three years ago has become popular among small business owners due to its no monthly fee feature and a growing suite of built-in business applications.

By providing transparency and value and eliminating extraneous fees Bluevine has created a digital-first experience that caters to the preferences of modern business owners the release said.

Since its inception Bluevine has served over 500000 business owners and facilitated more than $14 billion in loans per the release.

The company’s approach has been to create a checking account that goes beyond utility and becomes an essential application for running successful companies Bluevine CEO Eyal Lifshitz said in the release.

Bluevine has also introduced a small business credit card and launched accounts payable providing small business owners with bill management automation and enhanced payment capabilities the release said.

Bluevine has expanded FDIC insurance coverage on balances up to $3 million per the release. Its banking services are provided by Coastal Community Bank and lines of credit are issued by Celtic Bank.

The company has also partnered with Wise to provide an international payments and foreign exchange solution according to the release. Bluevine also recently launched Bluevine Premier a plan designed for scaling companies with growing needs.

Operational transparency into spend can revolutionize the way businesses manage their finances as well as optimize their financial workflows and payments Bluevine Chief Product Officer Herman Man told PYMNTS in an interview posted in August.

“The need for expense management to understand the spend to understand how it maps back to policies and budget is fundamental and really rudimentary” Man said at the time.

And forecasts show dry conditions may persist in 2024 depending on the location. Luckily there are lessons you can take from this season to prepare for future challenges particularly when it comes to weed control.

How Drought Impacts Weed Control

Enlist® Field Specialist Steve Snyder says there are a couple of reasons drought makes weed control more difficult.

“First residual herbicides need moisture most requiring at least ¼ inch to ½ inch of rain to activate and continue protecting your soybeans” he says. “But during drought you might not get necessary rainfall for residual activation allowing weed seeds to germinate and grow.”

Snyder says another challenge is some weeds will literally become tougher during drought.

“Certain varieties like kochia develop a thick waxy cuticle to conserve water making it more difficult for herbicides to penetrate weed tissue for effective control” he says.

Effective Weed Control During Drought

If you’re facing dry conditions next year Snyder has four steps for better weed control:

1 . Plan a program approach — “Use a program approach with burndown pre- and postemergence applications including several modes of action plus overlapping residuals” he says. “This will help keep soybeans protected if weather impairs the efficacy of one of your passes.”

For Enlist E3® soybeans Snyder recommends starting with Sonic® herbicide preemergence which offers two modes of action and several weeks’ residual activity and then applying Enlist One® and Liberty® herbicides together with a residual such as EverpreX® herbicide postemergence.

“Enlist One plus Liberty is the most effective postemergence treatment to control difficult weeds like kochia and waterhemp. Along with Sonic and EverpreX you’ve got five different modes of action and extended residual activity in one program” he says. “This will not only help control your trouble weeds but also mitigate resistance and help overcome setbacks drought creates.”

2 . Use the right tank mix — Snyder says you may need to increase herbicide rates and evaluate the adjuvants you’re putting in the tank during drought.

“If you have weeds developing thick cuticles consider adjusting your adjuvant package” he says. “Maybe you planned to use a nonionic surfactant and find in talking with your retailer you actually need a crop oil or a methylated seed oil to penetrate that waxy weed layer.”

3 . Time applications correctly — Snyder says the right herbicide application timing is especially important when weather is tricky.

“You should always put down contact herbicides when weeds are small — about 2 inches tall — for best control. This timing becomes critical when conditions aren’t perfect” he says. “And if you catch a little rain in the forecast try to apply shortly before. That could activate residuals — and prevent 2-inch waterhemp from turning into 6-inch waterhemp within a few days.”

4 . Stay flexible — Finally Snyder recommends starting the season with a plan but being ready to change.

“You may need to switch products or adjust application timing — little tweaks like that. Stay alert and pivot if necessary” he says. “The Enlist weed control system offers great flexibility for these situations. Not only are Enlist E3 soybeans tolerant to three postemergence herbicides — 24-D choline found in Enlist herbicides; glyphosate; and glufosinate the active ingredient in Liberty herbicide — Enlist One herbicide is compatible with more than 1700 tank-mix partners.”

And remember to start the process well before your soybean seed goes into the ground.

Start Clean at Planting

“When we’re planting we want a clean field” says Steve Snyder Enlist® field specialist. “We want to start clean with tillage or a quality burndown program. Once you get behind on weed control you’re usually behind most of the year.”

He says success comes from proper application timing and using different modes of action as well as residuals.

“It’s much easier to kill a weed that has only one or two growing points. That’s why it’s important to get your preemergence herbicide out prior to or soon after planting” Snyder explains. “For instance in Enlist E3 soybean fields you can apply Sonic herbicide preplant or up to three days after planting. Sonic offers two modes of action and several weeks of residual activity.”

Layer Residual Herbicides

Depending on the product a residual can provide four to eight weeks of control as long as it gets enough moisture to activate. However that protection eventually wears out. That’s where it pays to use layered residuals.

“By layered residuals we mean adding a residual product to your postemergence application program as well” Snyder says. “If you make a timely postemergence application of a residual with an Enlist herbicide you can expand protection until the crop canopies and weed pressure declines.”

For example EverpreX® herbicide can be tank-mixed with Enlist One® herbicide to provide an additional mode of action and several weeks’ residual weed control to protect Enlist E3® soybeans postemergence.

Use Multiple Modes of Action

Snyder also contends multiple modes of action offer important near- and long-term benefits. He recommends using at least three different modes of action per crop per season — and to try switching up the ones you use season over season.

For instance most preemergence premix herbicides contain at least two modes of action. Then as part of a postemergence program Enlist Duo® herbicide offers two more: 24-D choline and glyphosate. You also can get those two additional postemergence modes by instead tank-mixing Enlist One (24-D choline) with glyphosate or Liberty® herbicide (glufosinate). Finally if you add a qualified residual post you get a fifth mode of action. It’s important to note Enlist One and Enlist Duo are the only 24-D products that can be used with Enlist crops.

“Different modes of action working on that weed gives us more effective control. It also helps reduce potential for resistance in the future” Snyder says. “We got used to relying on one mode of action in the past and we know the results. We don’t want that to happen again. We want to be able to use this incredibly effective tool we have in the Enlist weed control system not just one or two years but for many years to come.”

Plan for 2024 Weed Control

As you work on your 2024 field management and weed control plans for Enlist E3 soybeans Snyder says now is a great time to take advantage of additional resources to help.

“We have educational materials covering everything you need to know about implementing a program approach to weed control” he says. “I recommend starting with the A Step Ahead webinars. This series features Enlist field specialists presenting expert advice on a range of topics including planting on-target applications and tank-mixing with Enlist herbicides.”

That in turn could bolster national and international efforts to reckon with the public health and environmental dangers of the 12000 common compounds classified as PFAS which do not break down in the environment or in the body.

The Cape Fear River provides water to 1.5 million people 500000 of whom live south of the Fayetteville Works chemical plant.* For more than three decades unbeknownst to residents the plant owned first by DuPont and then by the Dutch company Chemours slowly contaminated the river and local wells with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances which are carcinogenic. In 2017 the public long confused by the commonplace occurrence of rare illnesses learned who was responsible when a local newspaper broke the story.

In April a grassroots organization trying to bring Chemours to account wrote a detailed letter to the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Human Rights asking it to consider the contamination a violation of international human rights law. Over Thanksgiving weekend Special Rapporteur Marcos Orellana did just that in letters sent to DuPont Chemours and Corteva — the three companies associated with Fayetteville Works — and the governments of the United States and the Netherlands.

The letters say the Fayetteville Works plant contaminated more than 100 miles of the river for 40 years and counting and allege that Chemours knew about the harmful effects of PFAS pollution and likely suppressed that information. The missive to the U.S. government urges the EPA to hold the company accountable while the document sent to Dutch officials demands an end to the export of PFAS waste to the region. Chemours has been sending such material to the plant for processing and disposal because U.S. laws are more lenient than those in Europe.

Cape Fear residents are relying on the U.N.’s action to bring them some redress after years of fighting for epidemiological studies by the EPA and a shutdown of Fayetteville Works.

“We’re hoping this helps the U.S. government find the political courage it needs” said Emily Donovan cofounder of community organizing group Clean Cape Fear. “No one wants to be labeled as harboring a human rights violator.”

In the letter to Chemours Orellana expressed discomfort and alarm at what he called the company’s long-term disinformation campaigns which included obfuscating the true danger of PFAS chemicals and proferring them as a climate solution with no peer-reviewed science backing the claim. “In one study” Orellana wrote in the letter to Chemours “Certain PFAS were found in 97 percent of local residents tested.” Other peer-reviewed studies cited in the letter linked per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in the bloodstream to several forms of cancer fertility and endocrine disorders and lung diseases.

The letters follow a series of lawsuits against the same companies over water contamination issues including one that was recently settled for $110 million in Ohio.

In a statement to Grist and a response to the U.N. letter Chemours denied wrongdoing adding that its products are vital to the green transition. “At Chemours we support science-based regulation and our remediation activity and emissions control technologies are grounded in the best available science and proven approaches” said the company. However it has sought a permit from the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality to expand PFAS production particularly of a chemical called GenX that is particularly difficult to filter out of municipal water systems.

Claudia Polsky the environmental director of the University of California-Berkeley Law Clinic helped write the letter seeking U.N. intervention. She said most of the work the companies have done to address the problem has focused on avoiding liability not controlling emissions. She hopes a human rights framing could pave the way for more sweeping reforms.

“The great thing about framing this accurately as a violation of human rights” said Polsky “is that framing is capacious enough to include stories about PFAS health harms ecological harms corporate responsibility about lack of regulatory vigor about inadequate legal remedies for people who are coming out injured.” It also connects the injustices in North Carolina with similar stories elsewhere in the world bolstering the case for an international movement to address PFAS as a global problem and regulate them as a class of chemicals rather than one by one.

The U.N. declaration is the first of its kind in the United States. It is preceded by a similar though less detailed action by the U.N. Special Rapporteur in Veneto Italy which inspired the residents of Cape Fear to believe they might be able to catch the international body’s attention. PFAS they say is a problem with global consequences.

Community members and officials in North Carolina castigated the EPA last month for approving a permit for Chemours to import 4 million additional pounds of GenX PFAS waste from the Netherlands despite a 2019 EPA order requiring the company to reduce its pollution in the Cape Fear watershed. The EPA put the import on pause after local media uncovered it causing community outcry. The federal government has not yet responded to the rapporteur’s letter.

Harper Peterson a former mayor of Wilmington North Carolina and state senator for the region is a founding member of the Clean Cape Fear Coalition. He hopes this international attention will force the EPA to adopt tougher drinking water standards generate enough public outrage for the state to deny Chemours’ expansion permit and trigger what he calls much-needed epidemiological studies into the harms of PFAS. The challenge he said has been proving to legislators that blowback from their constituents will cost them more than corporate pressure to do nothing.

If the U.S. fails to address the issue the special rapporteur said it will be viewed as negligent in ensuring the rights of its own citizens. “We remain preoccupied that these actions infringe on community members’ right to life right to health right to a healthy clean and sustainable environment and the right to clean water among others” Orellana said in the letter.

*Correction: an earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the whole of the Cape Fear river as providing water to 500000 people. The river provides water to 1.5 million people in total."

During the Thanksgiving holiday week U.S. hotel occupancy dropped 13 percentage points from the prior week which is in line with performance trends of the past 10 years excluding 2020 and 2021.

Meanwhile global hotel occupancy outside the U.S. continues to show year-over-year growth with the United Kingdom and Japan posting the strongest performance across the largest countries. China continues to post the greatest year-over-year gains in hotel performance as the country has fully opened back up to travel.

Large-scale events continue to drive market-level hotel performance gains which also give a boost to hotels at the country level.

The Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix had an outsize impact on U.S. hotel performance with the market seeing ADR gains for the race week of 81.9%. The next week the United Arab Emirates gearing up to host COP28 posted the highest occupancy in the world.

US Performance

The week before Thanksgiving U.S. hotel industry average daily rates were up 7% year over year. Occupancy remained essentially flat down 0.4 percentage points from the same week last year which limited revenue per available room growth to 6.3%. Occupancy declined by a greater percentage on weekends and the shoulder days of Sunday and Thursday while weekdays remained unchanged compared to last year. That’s an indication that business travelers were on the road getting work done before the holiday.

U.S. hotel occupancy during Thanksgiving week was 49.8% a 13-percentage-point drop from the previous week. Compared to Thanksgiving week last year occupancy was down only slightly. Thanksgiving-week ADR increased less than 1% year over year.

Thanksgiving week typically does not produce strong ADR growth. Overall this year’s Thanksgiving hotel demand was the fifth highest ever which aligns with TSA airport screenings hitting all-time highs for the week.

As the usual end-of-year slowdown takes place events have more impact than if they occurred during higher demand periods.

For instance the Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix on Nov. 16-18 had a significant impact on the Las Vegas hotel market which represents 3.1% of all U.S. room supply. When significant events occur in a market the size of Las Vegas the impact is felt throughout the country. Minus Las Vegas overall U.S hotel performance for the week before Thanksgiving still showed a significant rate increase of 3.6% year over year. That means Vegas contributed about half of the overall ADR gain in the U.S. for the week. Occupancy without Las Vegas decreased 0.1 percentage points instead of a 0.4 percentage-point decline.

For the week before Thanksgiving the top 25 markets on average increased ADR 11.7% year over year with Las Vegas again having an outsize impact as ADR in the market increased 81.9% year over year. Las Vegas occupancy declined 10 percentage points as the major event and higher prices kept some tourists and conferences away.

San Francisco also had a strong week hosting the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders’ Week with an ADR gain of 26.2% driving RevPAR up 36.2%.

Five other top 25 markets — Boston Denver Houston Seattle and Washington D.C. — achieved year-over-year ADR increases greater than 10% for the week. The last time seven markets achieved ADR increases of 10% or better was in April 2023.

During Thanksgiving week the top 25 markets took the biggest week-over-week hit as business and group travel ground to a halt. New York City and Oahu posted the highest occupancies across the top 25 markets. Across the rest of the country leisure destinations such as the Florida Keys Gatlinburg Maui Kauai and Fort Lauderdale posted the highest occupancy. The Florida Keys had the top occupancy in the nation for the first time since mid-April.

Across all markets Gatlinburg hotels had the highest Thanksgiving Day occupancy followed by New York City Long Island and Bergen/Passaic New Jersey — the later three helped by the annual Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.

Global Performance

For the week ending Nov. 18 global occupancy excluding the U.S. was 68.7% up 1.1 percentage points from the prior week 4.6 percentage points year over year. ADR reached $135 up 9.7% year over year and resulting a 17.8% RevPAR increase to $93.

Japan led the top 10 countries in occupancy at 80.3% up 0.2 percentage points year over year. This lines up with the opening of borders to 16 countries about a year ago allowing travel to resume.

Over the Thanksgiving week global occupancy excluding the U.S. was flat to the prior week perhaps missing American travelers who stayed home for the Thanksgiving holiday. Compared to last year occupancy increased 5.6 percentage points. ADR for the week was $134 up 9.8% year over year boosting RevPAR by 19.4% to $92.

U.K. hotels posted the highest occupancy among the top 10 countries with the highest hotel room counts at 79.1% up 1.8 percentage points year over year. London hotel occupancy was 83.4% while occupancy outside of London was 77.3%. London has posted year-over-year occupancy gains in 42 of 47 weeks this year showing that business demand has been returning throughout 2023.

The United Arab Emirates hotel market had a great week gearing up to host COP28 with the highest occupancy in the world as well as its fourth best results for occupancy and ADR this year. Occupancy came in at 88.9% up 7.6 percentage points year over year and ADR at $240 an 11.7% increase.

COST,Costco,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xNzE1MDM0NzkxL2Nvc3Rjby1nb2VzLXNob3BwaW5nLWZvci1hLWRhbGxhcy1vZmZpY2UtdG93ZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Costco Goes Shopping for a Dallas Office Tower,"Costco Wholesale Corp. is the highest bidder for a 10-story office building next to one of its largest stores in Dallas the latest in a series of similar deals by the retailing giant around the country.

The 198374-square-foot office building known as North Central Plaza I at 12655 N. Central Expressway is being auctioned off by Hartman SPE a real estate firm working its way through the bankruptcy process. The property owner has asked the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware to approve the $14.25 million sale to Costco.

This wouldn't be the first time the wholesale club has bought an office building. In the past few years Costco has strategically acquired similar properties such as the purchase of the former Hertz Corp. office building at 14501 Quail Springs Parkway in Oklahoma City for a new operations center. In June Costco also bought a small 1980s-vintage office building at 7375 Boston Blvd. in Springfield Virginia adjacent to its retail center at 7373 Boston Blvd. to possibly expand its operations.

The next highest bidder for the Dallas office property put in a bid for less than $12.1 million according to documents filed with the court. Attorneys for Hartman SPE filed the paperwork to complete the deal alerting the public they have until 3 p.m. CST on Dec. 13 to object to the potential sale which requires approval from the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case.

Costco did not immediately respond to interview requests from CoStar News.

Robert ""Bob"" Young executive managing director at Dallas-based retail real estate brokerage Weitzman who was not involved in the deal said the retailer likely has a plan already for the property. Costco is often looking for nearby properties to build gas stations or fulfillment centers.

""Costco has it going on and when you look at their footprints and their business if potential space comes available to adjacent locations they have been known to purchase it"" Young said. ""This is a reminder that your best prospect or buyer is your next-door neighbor and to always be looking at who owns real estate adjacent to one of your properties.""

Mike Geisler founding principal and managing partner of Dallas-based retail brokerage Venture Commercial who also was not involved in the sale predicted Costco would not be an office landlord for long.

""They will likely tear it down"" Geisler speculated. ""Everyone is doing different things with fulfillment centers today with a lot of experimentation underway and it would make sense for them to want to give their customers more conveniences.""

Besides he added: ""Retailers are poor landlords. They usually want to stick to their core business which is being a retailer and I could see them wanting to wind down the office leases in the building as quick as possible.""

The market where the building sits traditionally has appealed to companies looking to house their back-office operations such as insurance or financial services firms. Many have begun to rethink how they do business Geisler said. According to CoStar data the office building is about 72% leased with its largest tenants including Zion Oil & Gas Move It Storage and Cadence Bank.

The early 1980s-vintage building likely needs quite a few updates Geisler said which could explain the price.

For office buildings past their prime Moody Younger co-founder of Dallas-based real estate services firm Younger Partners said it's not uncommon for office buildings to be sold for land value since many can't be easily converted into more productive use such as apartments.

More Sales

The proposed sale of this North Dallas office building is part of a larger portfolio sale being pursued by Hartman SPE a subsidiary of Silver Star Properties REIT. Hartman filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to sell an office retail and industrial portfolio last valued at $400 million in an effort to pay back $217 million in debt.

This week U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath gave Hartman SPE approval to sell Gateway Tower an office building spanning more than 260000 square feet at 8111 Lyndon B Johnson Freeway in Dallas to Hamilton Commercial. The deal totaled more than $14.1 million according to court records. Two other Houston properties also were approved for sale by the bankruptcy judge including:

(NASDAQ:COST) is well known for being a global retail giant with a huge moat. The late Charlie Munger (Trades Portfolio) often proclaimed his love for the company: I love everything about Costco. I'm total addict and I'm never going to sell a share. In the U.S. retail chains like The Home Depot Inc.(NYSE:HD) and Floor & Decor Holdings Inc. (NYSE:FND) have copied its business model.

Although these three retailers share similar business models their outcomes and operational efficiencies vary with Costco leading in efficiency followed by Home Depot and then Floor & Decor.

The volume company not a margin company

Costco's business model focuses on generating high sales volumes rather than maximizing profit margins on individual products. Craig Jelinek Costco's CEO also explained the essence of the business: We are the volume company not a margin company.

Shopping at Costco requires a membership. The company offers high-quality products at exceptional prices fostering a loyal customer base that drives substantial traffic and volume. This high traffic grants it significant leverage in negotiations with suppliers. Munger once commented that Costco does not hold investments in inventory. Instead the company delays payment to suppliers until after it has received payment for the products scheduling supplier payments only once the items are slated for sale. This purchasing power enables the retailer to obtain top-quality products at the lowest costs from suppliers further enhancing the value offered to its members.

Costco has the most efficient operations

When examining operating efficiency Costco distinctly outperforms the other two retailers showcasing superior operating performance and efficiency. Over the past decade it has maintained a stunningly high inventory turnover rate with its average days inventory outstanding consistently ranging between 28 and 32 days. In contrast Home Depot exhibits a significantly higher DIO with an average of 65 to 82 days. The most pronounced difference is seen in Floor & Decor which takes the longest time to turn inventory into sales ranging from 152 to 187 daysabout five to six times slower than Costco.

Costco Home Depot and Floor & Decor: Diverging Outcomes From a Similar Model

Regarding the efficiency of collecting payments post-sale Costco again emerged as the leader. Since 2012 its days sales outstanding have been impressively brief ranging from just three to four days. Home Depot follows albeit with a slightly higher DSO of 5.5 to eight days. Although Floor & Decor outperformed Home Depot in 2013 with a marginally lower DSO it has consistently taken the longest to collect payment for its sales from 2014 through 2022 with a DSO in the range of seven to 13 days.

In terms of supplier payments Floor & Decor has the capacity to delay payments to its suppliers the longest while Costco stands out for paying its suppliers the soonest. This approach aligns logically with Costco's ability to receive payments from sales much more quickly than both Home Depot and Floor & Decor facilitating its faster payment cycle to suppliers.

The cash conversion cycle is an integral metric that combines all three aforementioned efficiency ratios. It is a crucial metric that measures the time a company takes to convert its investments in inventory receivables and other resources into cash flows from sales. Costco's CCC is particularly impressive thanks to its low days sales outstanding and high inventory turnover. This efficiency has not only been consistently remarkable but has also improved over time. Between 2012 and 2019 its CCC remained within a strikingly short range of three to seven days. In 2021 Costco achieved a negative CCC indicating its operations were essentially financed by its vendors. Home Depot while efficient ranks second with a CCC of 31 to 48 days. In stark contrast Floor & Decor's CCC is considerably higher ranging from 75 to 120 days demonstrating a much slower conversion of resources to cash compared to Costco.

Home Depot has the highest profitability ratios

Due to its low-price strategy Costco has the lowest profit margin among the three companies. Its net margin ranged from just 1.8% to 2.6% while Floor & Decor's profit margin was slightly higher. Home Depot leads in terms of profitability starting with a 6% profit margin in 2012 and gradually climbing to nearly 10.9% at the time of this writing.

In the realm of return on invested capital Home Depot again stands out. Its return on invested capital increased from 19.8% in 2014 reaching a peak of 40.28% in 2018 before stabilizing at 34.34% in 2022. Costco ranks second with a 14.65% return on invested capital while Floor & Decor trails with a significantly lower return on invested capital of only 9.74% in 2022.

Costco is the highest valued among the three

From 2013 to 2018 the valuations of Home Depot and Costco were quite similar with their Ebitda multiples hovering around 11 times to 16 times. Subsequently however their valuations began to diverge. Costco's multiples increased surpassing those of Home Depot whose Ebitda multiples were more stable. During the past decade Costco's highest Ebitda multiple nearly reached 30 times while Home Depot's peak was at only 19.4. In contrast Floor & Decor has the most fluctuating multiples ranging broadly from 13.2 to as high as 43.

At the time of writing Costco holds the highest valuation with an enterprise value/Ebitda multiple of nearly 21.82. Floor & Decor follows valued slightly lower at 21.65 while Home Depot has the most modest valuation among the three with an enterprise value/Ebitda ratio of only 14.34.

Costco Home Depot and Floor & Decor: Diverging Outcomes From a Similar Model

Key takeaway

Costco has crafted a unique business model that prioritizes volume over margins cultivating an impressive efficiency in inventory turnover and a quick cash conversion cycle. This model not only ensures a consistent flow of high-quality products at competitive prices but also fortifies the company's financial health and customer loyalty. While Home Depot and Floor & Decor have attempted to replicate Costco's successful strategy their outcomes vary significantly. Home Depot though trailing behind in operational efficiency excels in profitability and return on invested capital. Floor & Decor meanwhile faces challenges in inventory turnover and cash conversion reflecting the diverse challenges inherent in the retail sector. Among the three Costco with its excellecent in operating efficiency and Home Depot with the highest margin and return invested on capital seem to fit well in long-term investors' portfolios.

Costco Wholesale's (COST 0.09%) business has exploded in recent years helping it become one of the world's most successful retailers. In the last five years alone shares of the warehouse retailer have soared 166%. The company's unique business model of offering an annual membership in exchange for access to wholesale items at industry-low prices has won over shoppers worldwide.

Yet Costco is only at the start of its global expansion. The company is on a path to continue seeing significant financial gains year over year as it grows its international footprint. Here's why Costco is a screaming long-term buy right now.

Its stock is outperforming the competition

The retail industry is highly competitive with Costco up against major corporations such as Amazon Walmart and Target. However Costco has differentiated itself from the competition with its wholesale model and allowed space for its customers to shop at competing stores while also visiting its locations on a regular basis. As a result Costco has significantly outperformed its peers in recent years.

The chart below shows that since 2018 shares in Costco have delivered close to double the growth of its biggest U.S. competitors. The company's performance over the last five years also illustrates its reliability. While Amazon and Target have experienced dramatic peaks and valleys in their stock prices Costco shares have more consistently trended upward.

In addition to impressive stock gains Costco's financials are growing at a faster pace than any of the companies above. The chart below shows that Costco's quarterly revenue has risen 125% in the last five years more than Amazon Walmart or Target in the same period.

The supermarket and grocery industry hit a value of $11 trillion in 2021 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3% through 2030. While its growth might not be as significant as some tech industries it's a good sector to invest in and hold over several decades. Meanwhile Costco's history of reliable gains and ability to regularly outperform its competitors makes it an attractive option.

Massive growth potential lies abroad

Costco has an impressive past. However its future is even more exciting. The company operates 870 stores across 14 countries and is rapidly expanding. Its popular business model has traversed cultures and continents with customers embracing the company far and wide.

For instance Costco opened its first store in France in 2017 a country famously difficult for foreign companies to enter (Walt Disney faced protests when opening Disneyland Paris in 1992). Yet Costco's first store was a massive success in the European country with the company announcing plans to open 15 additional units in France by 2025.

Additionally in 2023 the company ventured into China for the first time and has already expanded to five stores in the country. Despite operating in 14 countries Costco continues to have significant growth potential abroad. In six of those countries the company has five or fewer locations indicating almost endless expansion possibilities within those regions and new ones.

In the fourth quarter of Costco's fiscal 2023 revenue rose 9.5% year over year beating Wall Street expectations by more than $1 billion. The company's international segment reported revenue growth of 4% surpassing the 3% revenue growth of the U.S. The company opens an average of 25 new locations annually and will likely see its international stores eventually surpass its domestic business. Costco's focus on expanding abroad is promising for its long-term future and will likely provide consistent growth for years.

Like most retail businesses Costco is vulnerable to economic fluctuations. However its history of reliability and solid revenue growth is a compelling reason to make a long-term investment in its stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vcGFyYWRlLmNvbS9mb29kL2Nvc3Rjby1maW5kcy1kZWNlbWJlci0yMDIz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Best Costco Finds December 2023,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://parade.com/food/costco-finds-december-2023 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vcGFyYWRlLmNvbS9mb29kL2Nvc3Rjby1maW5kcy1kZWNlbWJlci0yMDIz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

(“Elliott”) which manages funds that collectively have an investment of approximately $2 billion in Crown Castle Inc. on Wednesday submitted a Section 220 demand and accompanying letter to the Crown Castle Board requesting inspection of the company’s books and records. This request follows the company’s adoption of shareholder-unfriendly amendments to its bylaws that compromise the fundamental tenets of the shareholder franchise: to nominate directors and seek change in the boardroom.

The letter sent on Tuesday took aim at the board’s adoption in 2021 of expansive “Acting in Concert” provisions which Elliott called “an inappropriate and aggressive form of corporate entrenchment with the clear purpose of disenfranchising shareholders.”

The letter is keeping the pressure on Crown Castle a day after the activist disclosed another letter regarding Crown Castle concerns as reported by Wireless Estimator where they asked for the removal of Crown Castle CEO Jay Brown.

Elliott said it believes the company adopted “extraordinarily shareholder-unfriendly” amendments to its bylaws that Elliott believes are prohibited under Delaware law.

According to the Wall Street Journal the amendments act like a so-called poison pill that would group investors together and penalize them for allegedly teaming up against the company. Elliott called this a “minefield” for shareholder communications.

In its letter Elliott contended “the overarching issue is Crown Castle’s track record on corporate governance” which Elliott had recommended improving in 2020. Rather than adopting best-in-class governance however the Crown Castle Board subsequently approved the problematic bylaw amendments which were designed to have the effect of stifling “even the most basic forms of shareholder communication and at the very least were designed to weaken the shareholder franchise” the letter said. Elliott wrote further “we note that the Board adopted these bylaws less than six months after the Delaware Court of Chancery very visibly struck down a virtually identical ‘acting in concert’ provision.”

In its letter Elliott wrote “the Board’s actions constitute a classic form of entrenchment” and stated its belief that the provisions “are prohibited under Delaware law and that in implementing them members of the Board breached their fiduciary duties.”

The letter concluded by stating “It is time for Crown Castle’s Board to be reconstituted with directors who share a commitment to best-in-class governance.” Elliott the letter said “look[s] forward to receiving the documents requested in our Section 220 demand to better understand the Board’s process and will evaluate our next steps.”

The full text of the letter follows:

November 28 2023

Board of Directors

Crown Castle Inc.

8020 Katy Freeway

Houston TX 77024

Dear Members of the Board:

We are writing to you again on behalf of Elliott Associates L.P. and Elliott International L.P. (together “Elliott” or “we”) which have an investment of approximately $2 billion in Crown Castle Inc. (the “Company” or “Crown Castle”). As stated in our prior letter we believe the Crown Castle Board adopted extraordinarily shareholder-unfriendly amendments to its bylaws in 2021 that compromise the fundamental tenets of the shareholder franchise: to nominate directors and seek change in the Boardroom. Not only did the Board’s actions constitute a classic form of entrenchment we believe the Board adopted provisions that are prohibited under Delaware law and that in implementing them members of the Board breached their fiduciary duties. Today we have submitted a Section 220 demand to allow us to inspect the Company’s books and records related to these actions.

The Board’s adoption of expansive “Acting in Concert” (“AIC”) provisions is an inappropriate and aggressive form of corporate entrenchment with the clear purpose of disenfranchising shareholders. These provisions would deem any person to be “acting in concert” with any other shareholder that nominates directors if the person supports the nomination and engages in any “parallel” activity regardless of whether any agreement or understanding has been formed with the nominating shareholder. Even worse the AIC provisions adopted by this Board include a “daisy-chain” feature which would classify any third person as “acting in concert” with the nominating shareholder even if the nominating shareholder and third person have never communicated or even know each other exist. Taken together these provisions create a minefield for entirely appropriate shareholder communication in the context of a shareholder election.

While we can only assume that the Board was advised by its lawyers in the adoption of these provisions (and chose to proceed anyway) we note that the Board adopted these bylaws less than six months after the Delaware Court of Chancery very visibly struck down a virtually identical “acting in concert” provision. In the February 2021 Williams Cos. v. Wolosky decision the Court concluded that a substantively identical AIC provision in a shareholder rights plan contained an “extreme unprecedented collection of features” that rendered the AIC provision unreasonable on its face. The Court criticized the “broad language” of the AIC definition which “sweeps up potentially benign stockholder communications ‘relating to changing or influencing the control of the Company.'” The Court also criticized the same “daisy chain” provision that has been adopted by the Crown Castle Board noting it “operates to aggregate stockholders even if members of the group have no idea that the other stockholders exist.” These offending provisions the Court concluded have a “stifling impact…on stockholder communications” and “impede a stockholder’s ability to launch a proxy contest by cutting off private communications in advance of proxy contests.”

The Court also credited an academic analysis identifying several problems with AIC provisions like those adopted by this Board which noted that:

“[The provisions] do not clearly specify what activities would result in aggregation…such vague provisions would have a chilling effect on an activist’s ability to communicate with other shareholders”; and





“[T]hese sorts of provisions threaten to chill the sort of shareholder interaction upon which sound corporate governance depends and that decades of reform have sought to encourage.”1

To demonstrate the absurdity of the expansive AIC provision like the one adopted by the Crown Castle Board here the Court used the following example of hypothetical unaffiliated stockholders—Remus and Lupin—each of which owned 3% of Williams’s stock:

“Remus sends a letter to Williams asking for ESG initiatives and threatening to buy up stock and run a proxy contest if the Board does not adopt his proposal. Lupin has reviewed and agrees with Remus’s proposal. Can Lupin meet with the Board Remus or other Williams stockholders to discuss Remus’s ESG proposal without triggering the Plan? Probably not. Can Remus communicate with other stockholders to determine whether there is support for his ESG proposal before launching the proxy context without fear of triggering the Plan? Not without risk of aggregating those stockholders under the AIC Provision.”

Virtually identical AIC provisions were also litigated in 2019 in In re Versum Materials Inc. Stockholder Litigation. There the Court did not have an opportunity to issue a decision on the merits of the shareholder challenge because the company decided to “remove[] the acting-in-concert provision” at issue. However Vice Chancellor Laster expressed concern with the “truly expansive” provision explaining that “[w]hat the act[ing]-in-concert provision attempts to cut off or at least threaten is all of the activities that lead up to the giving of the revocable proxy.”

While we believe these legal issues are of critical importance in assessing the validity of Crown Castle’s bylaws and whether members of the Board breached their fiduciary duties the overarching issue is Crown Castle’s track record on corporate governance. We remind you of Elliott’s recommendation during our 2020 engagement that the Crown Castle Board adopt “best-in-class” corporate governance. A year later this Board approved bylaw amendments that had the effect of stifling even the most basic forms of shareholder communication and at the very least were designed to weaken the shareholder franchise. As the academic article cited by the Williams court expressly recognized “Thirty years of corporate law reform has been aimed at encouraging shareholders to become more active and to consult with other shareholders…[I]n an effective corporate democracy shareholders meeting together is a necessity not a danger.” Yet this is precisely what this Board’s bylaw amendments sought to prevent.

It is time for Crown Castle’s Board to be reconstituted with directors who share a commitment to best-in-class governance. We look forward to receiving the documents requested in our Section 220 demand to better understand the Board’s process and will evaluate our next steps.

Best regards

On Friday Netflix released a new trailer and images of The Crown season 6 part 2 which debuts on Dec. 14 and will conclude the series. For the first time since the drama inspired by the lives of the British royal family premiered in 2016 the streamer split the season into two installments. Part 1 dropped on Nov. 16 and focused on Princess Diana’s final days before her death in 1997 while part 2 is expected to take the show into the early 2000s and conclude multiple storylines — with at least one epic flashback.

On May 8 1945 celebrations erupted across Great Britain and the United States after Germany surrendered to the Allied Powers marking the start of the end of World War II. Crowds rushed the streets of London and members of the royal family — King George VI Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother then-Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret — appeared on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with Prime Minister Winston Churchill.

It’s a little-known fact that Elizabeth then 19 and Margaret then 14 later left the palace incognito to join the celebrations! Years later Queen Elizabeth called it ""one of the most memorable nights of my life.""

A still photo from The Crown's final installment shows then-Princess Elizabeth (played by Viola Prettejohn) and Princess Margaret (played by Beau Gadsdon) smirking outdoors with two military officers behind them. The actresses wore the same outfits that cameras caught them filming in last year: a pink dress and sweater for Margaret and an army green military uniform and hat for Elizabeth. During WWII the future Queen Elizabeth served in a reserve unit and was also named Colonel of the Grenadier Guards.

While no photos from Elizabeth and Margaret’s VE Day adventure are known to exist the princesses received permission from their parents to go out and were escorted by a group of guards The Independent reported.

In 2015 Buckingham Palace released a recording of the Queen's recollection of VE Day on its 70th anniversary. The Queen previously made the comments in 1985.

After waving to the crowds gathered in front of the balcony at the palace “every hour” Elizabeth and Margaret slipped out to experience the ebullience of the people who were celebrating all over London.

Recalling the ruckus Queen Elizabeth said ""We cheered the King and Queen on the balcony and then walked miles through the street. I remember lines of unknown people linking arms and walking down Whitehall all of us just swept along on a tide of happiness and relief.""

On Friday The Crown’s latest trailer imagined what might have happened.

The quick clip opens with the royal family posing for a stoic group photo and later flashes to an older Princess Margaret (played by Lesley Manville) looking at Queen Elizabeth (Imelda Staunton) with love as she raises a glass of champagne before a crowd.

“I will always be by your side” Manville says in an emotional voiceover. The trailer then flashed back to the royal sisters as teenagers (played by Prettejohn and Gadsdon) sharing a hug on what appears to be VE Day.

Netflix also dropped key art for the part 2 debut which hints at the stories set to unfold. One image depicts Queen Elizabeth (Staunton) from behind looking out at the balcony of Buckingham Palace with some of her family members around her. Princess Margaret (Manville) Jonathan Pryce (Prince Philip) and Dominic West (then-Prince Charles) all gaze out onto the balcony while Prince William (Ed McVey) looks at his father.

Kate and Victoria welcomed in the festive season in green and red dresses from Emilia Wickstead and Alice + Olivia. After a quick change (we love the idea of a Princess Diary-esque ‘getting ready montage’ but alas we’ll never know) the glamorous coterie continued the evening with a very special evening at the Royal Albert Hall.

The Princess of Wales seamlessly moved from day to night selecting another slick look in the same palette for the evenings’ proceedings. This time the deep teal ‘Talina’ gown from Safiyaa was fitted with sharp shoulder pads and dramatic slitted sleeves which trailed behind her. Holding his wife’s hand in a rare and tender gesture of public affection William was dashing in a black velvet tuxedo and bow tie.

CSX train derailment class action lawsuit overview:

Who: Lauren Webb and Debbie Francisco filed a class action lawsuit against CSX Transportation Inc.

Why: Webb and Francisco claim CSX is responsible for a Thanksgiving Eve train derailment that caused poisonous gasses to pour into the community of Rockcastle County Kentucky.

Where: The class action lawsuit was filed in Kentucky federal court.

CSX Transportation is responsible for a Thanksgiving Eve train derailment that led to a deadly fire and caused poisonous gasses to pour into the community of Rockcastle County Kentucky a new class action lawsuit alleges.

Plaintiffs Lauren Webb and Debbie Francisco claim CSX made a public statement following the train derailment that disclosed the incident happened due to a wheel bearing failure on one of the train cars.

Webb and Francisco argue the train derailment could have been prevented had CSX placed trackside detectors closer together and “more closely monitored the train’s wheel bearings.”

“CSX’s train should never have been operated in such a reckless manner that its wheel bearings would fail and cause derailment especially when the train carried highly toxic and combustible substances” the CSX class action states.

Webb and Francisco want to represent a class of all natural persons who resided or were present in the evacuation zone of the CSX train derailment in Rockcastle County Kentucky on Nov. 22 2023.

Residents report symptoms of sulfur dioxide exposure class action says

In the wake of the CSX train derailment Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency and instructed residents to clear the area with local officials later lifting the evacuation order on the afternoon of Thanksgiving Day according to the CSX class action.

Webb and Francisco argue residents in the area around the train derailment reported suffering from symptoms of sulfur dioxide exposure such as burning eyes and throats in the immediate aftermath of the CSX train derailment.

“As a result of CSX’s failures plaintiffs and class members have been exposed to toxic and noxious chemicals” the CSX class action states.

Webb and Francisco claim CSX is guilty of private nuisance negligence ultrahazardous activities and willful and wanton conduct.

The plaintiffs demand a jury trial and request injunctive and declaratory relief along with an award of compensatory punitive and exemplary damages for themselves and all class members.

Ohio residents filed a similar class action lawsuit against Norfolk Southern earlier this year over claims a February train derailment caused residents in East Palestine Ohio both physical and monetary harm.

On Nov. 22 a CSX train derailed around 2:30 p.m. just north of Livingston near the remote town with about 200 people in Rockcastle County.

“Two of the 16 cars that derailed carried molten sulfur which caught fire after the cars were breached. No other hazardous materials were released” AP News said.

This resulted in the local residents being encouraged to evacuate just a day before the holiday with Local 12 reporting that some Livingston residents woke up on Thanksgiving in a middle school shelter.

Now CSX has released the believed cause of the derailment— a failed wheel bearing on the train car.

“Rail vehicle axle-bearing failure is a serious issue often resulting in service delays and potentially fire and derailment with obvious risks to life” a University of Southampton paper said.

While the derailment impacted the tracks the chemicals released were the cause of the most concern for officials.

“According to the Environmental Protection Agency website sulfur dioxide can cause respiratory problems depending on the concentration and length of exposure” AP News said. “CSX said it was thankful to Rockcastle County authorities who helped respond to the incident and to community members and local businesses that helped affected residents and assisted the company in serving Thanksgiving dinners for the community.”

Local 12 reported residents left to avoid any of the burning and unpleasant side effects with one even reporting a really bad asthma attack. After continuous testing the areas have been cleared.

“State officials monitored the air after the derailment for traces of hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide but there had been no detection of those substances at the derailment site or the nearby town of Livingston since Thursday morning” AP News said.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency in the county. He worked to assure the crews that state help was available and reminded the public that those working would be doing so during the holiday.

By Nov. 26 the company reported that crews were finishing up the restoration of the site. The 16 railcars and spilled chemicals had been removed 2500 tons of soil affected had been replaced with clean uncontaminated soil and crews were finishing up track repairs so the line could be used again.

But now the project could be finished in the next two years thanks to a state grant.

An $11.2 million grant awarded through the state’s Rebuild Illinois Capital plan will pay for the completion of the walking and bike path. The trail follows a former CSX railroad right-of-way from the edge of Urbana to Kickapoo State Park near Danville.

The Urbana Park District Champaign County Forest Preserve District and the Vermilion County Conservation District are building separate sections of the trail to provide a facility for people to enjoy recreation and a view of the Illinois countryside away from highway traffic.

Tim Bartlett is the executive director of the Urbana Park District. He says the park district plans to use money from the state grant to build a trailhead at Weaver Park and complete a portion of the trail connecting to its current eastern starting point near the Urbana Walmart. Bartlett says they’ve been hoping to be awarded the grant money for a long time.

“We’ve been looking and seeking and asking for help” said Bartlett. “Now that it’s here we just want to celebrate it get right to it and get it done so that people can get out on the trail and start enjoying it.

The Champaign County Forest Preserve District finished building a part of the trail extending from Urbana to Kolb Park located on the west side of St. Joseph. Lorrie Pearson the Executive Director notes that this section has already positively influenced the economy of the small town.

“St Joseph is a great success story” said Pearson “in terms of businesses that have popped up businesses that are reflecting the new customer base that they’re having from users of the trail and just the social connectivity that something like a trail can provide to a community.”

A three-mile stretch of the Kickapoo Rail Trail in Vermilion County which includes a 3100-foot-long trestle bridge was completed and opened in 2021. This former railway bridge now repurposed for the trail stands nearly 100 feet above the Middle Fork River offering scenic views of the surrounding landscape and wildlife.

When the rest of the Kickapoo Rail Trail is finished the entire trail will stretch from Weaver Park in Urbana to Kickapoo State Park near Danville.

Jeff Yockey chairman of Friends of the Kickapoo Rail Trail a private group formed to support the project says the benefits of the completed sections of the trail will be multiplied when the entire trail is completed.

“I think as you connect those sections to longer sections you have the ability to attract distance recreationalists” said Yockey. “Those that are interested can ride all the way in one day from Champaign-Urbana to Danville and then spend the night at Kickapoo State Park and come back. So as we are able to link the sections the opportunities grow.”

Yockey is hopeful that the Kickapoo Rail Trail will eventually join a broader rail trail network in central Illinois. His group Friends of the Kickapoo Rail Trail is working with Heartland Pathways to develop a trail along a former Illinois Central rail corridor that passes through Champaign Piatt and DeWitt Counties. The corridor was acquired by the late preservationist Dave Monk in the late 1980s but has been little-used since then.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vcGVvcGxlLmNvbS9zYW50YS10cmFpbi1raWNrcy1vZmYtaG9saWRheS1zZWFzb24taW4tYXBwYWxhY2hpYS1waG90b3MtODQwNzUxMtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Santa Train Visits Kentucky Tennessee and Virginia for 81st Year: See the Photos,"This Santa Claus doesn't need any reindeer!

As Roger Penske’s NTT INDYCAR SERIES program sets its sights on winning another Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge at Indianapolis Motor Speedway – it will aim for No. 20 when the green flags wave on May 26 2024 – it’s appropriate to consider the most unlikely of Penske’s victories. Two legendary names – Al Unser and Cummins – figured mightily in it.

The pairing of the entities in 1987 was about as last minute as last minute gets. The car a year-old March-Cosworth had previously been retired from racing and was on display in a hotel lobby in Reading Pennsylvania where the race team was based. Two weeks prior to the race Cummins Holset Turbo and Penske Racing teamed to field the car which was crashed in practice by Danny Ongais. With Ongais ruled out with a concussion Unser was selected as the driver despite having returned to his home in New Mexico after seeing no prospect of competing in the race.

A second-weekend qualifier Unser started 20th a full 8 mph slower than Mario Andretti’s pole speed. But Unser and his crew employed some outstanding pit strategy in the race and appeared set to finish third until Andretti (whose car failed) and Roberto Guerrero (damaged clutch led to a stall on final pit stop) faded. Unser took the lead on Lap 183 and never looked back to earn his fourth “500” victory tying A.J. Foyt’s mark. Also that day Unser supplanted Ralph DePalma as the event’s all-time lap leader with 613 laps led a mark he later extended to 644 laps. That record stood until 2023 when Scott Dixon broke it.

For Unser whose final “500” was 30 years ago it was a historical moment. For Cummins it was the continuation of an Indy tradition.

Cummins founder Clessie Cummins was known for his mechanical abilities and he was a pit crew member for Ray Harroun’s winning Marmon “Wasp” in the inaugural “500” in 1911. That alone would be enough to earn an honored place in the company’s motorsports history but the relationship didn’t end there. Cummins built many treasured memories in “The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.”

With the Great Depression hitting the “500” hard in the race’s 20th year cars to fill the 1931 field were difficult to come by. With no rules governing diesel-powered cars IMS owner Eddie Rickenbacker allowed Cummins to enter a car with a diesel truck engine mounted to a Duesenberg. As the car was significantly larger than other cars in the field Cummins didn’t expect to win the race – the car didn’t – but the No. 8 Cummins Special fared well.

Race officials required the car to post a qualifying average in excess of 80 mph and a mark of 96.871 mph was reached. With Dave Evans driving to a 13th-place finish the car became the first to complete the entire race without a pit stop. In doing so it burned 31 gallons of furnace oil valued at approximately $1.40.

As a side note the crew member giving hand signals to Evans was Jimmy Doolittle who later gained notoriety as a World War II general and aerial combat hero with his daring bombing raid over Tokyo in 1942.

Three years later in 1934 Cummins returned to the “500” with two competing engines in a bid to compare the durability and efficiency of two-cycle versus four-cycle engine designs. During the race the two-cycle initially driven by H.W. “Stubby” Stubblefield had numerous issues despite finishing the race in 12th place while the four-stroker ran smoothly until Evans stripped the gears on the No. 6 car pulling out from his first pit stop. Evans completed 81 laps before replacing Stubblefield in the No. 5. That “test” effectively sealed the fate of the two-cycle engine; Cummins diesels have been four-cycle ever since.

The next Cummins diesel to appear in the “500” was in 1950. By then those engines were a staple of the commercial trucking industry and Cummins engineers wanted to demonstrate that these workhorses could run like thoroughbreds. A four-cycle Cummins Model JS-600 in lightweight aluminum was crafted bearing a turbocharger. Dubbed “The Green Hornet” the car driven by Jimmy Jackson qualified at 129.20 mph and started in the 33rd position. On Race Day Jackson and the Cummins steadily climbed through the order and were in 16th position when a mechanical failure forced a retirement. The car went on to become the world’s fastest diesel topping 165 mph on the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah.

The only diesel engine to capture the pole at Indy came in 1952. With a supercharger the car had a unique side-lying six-cylinder engine design. The lower center of gravity offered better handling in corners. The No. 28 Cummins Diesel Special also was the first Indy car tested in a wind tunnel for aerodynamics and the results were amazing.

Freddie Agabashian who for weeks kept the abilities of his odd-looking and incredibly heavy machine secret captured the pole in a Kurtis Kraft chassis with the fastest single lap (139.104 mph) and four-lap average (138.010 mph) in IMS history. The car retired after completing 52 laps as the supercharger inlet became clogged with rubber debris from the track but it had established turbocharging as a viable technology on the track and helped Cummins engineers refine improvements to its new fuel system.

Agabashian and Cummins combined to provide one of the event’s biggest upsets – at least until Unser and Penske came along with Cummins in 1987.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN3YXJ0emZ1bmVyYWxob21laW5jLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyeS9tYXJ5LWN1bW1pbnPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary | Mary K.

Healthy Hearts bike winners Healthy Hearts bike winners NIHHC Healthy Hearts graduates with members of Cummins Inc and United Way Cummins bike build day 2023 Cummins bike build day 2023

ELKHART Ind. – The Northern Indiana Hispanic Health Coalition (NIHHC) Crossroads United Way serving Elkhart LaGrange and Noble Counties and Cummins Inc came together to give bikes to children in Elkhart County.

Organizers say the new bicycles were given out in hopes of promoting physical activity in benefit of children's health as part of the Healthy Hearts program which is taught amongst students in 4th through 6th grades in several Elkhart County schools.

“We thought NIHHC would be a great fit as a recipient with their focus on children and families and health through programs like Healthy Hearts” said Jill Yoder Director of Community Engagement and Volunteerism at Crossroads United Way.

The Healthy Hearts program teaches about the heart and the importance of healthy food choices and physical activity and as an incentive for their participation returning assignments and discussing the topics they learn in class with their families the students receive “Healthy Bucks” which they can use at the end of the program to “purchase” or claim prizes.

Students from Pinewood Elementary School and Roosevelt STEAM Academy were lucky enough to have new bikes as part of the prizes available.

Cummins Inc team members came together for a bike build day with Crossroads United Way making 80 children’s bikes for the community.

“We had such a fun day building bikes!” said Veronica Martin Cummins’ Custom Order Management Specialist who helped coordinate the bike build. “Our goal was to distribute these bikes to children who might not be able to get a bike due to financial barriers while also promoting an active lifestyle.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvc3Qtam91cm5hbC5jb20vbmV3cy90b3Atc3Rvcmllcy8yMDIzLzEyL3BpcGVsaW5lLXRvLWVtcGxveW1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Innovative Manufacturing Program Launched In Region | News Sports Jobs,"Western New York is a mecca of sorts for the manufacturing industry.

With numbers forecasted to continue reaching the billions of dollars mark a highly skilled and trained labor force is more important now than ever — a fact not lost on some within the industry.

To help achieve a pipeline into the manufacturing field the Manufacturers Association of the Southern Tier on Wednesday announced the official launch of a school-aged learning and recruiting pipeline program at the Cummins Jamestown Engine plant.

“The Dream It Do It program is a work ethics credential components program” said Todd Tranum MAST executive officer. “This will hopefully help with the growing need for quality employees to fill our skilled workforce requirements to feed the growing and expanding manufacturing market in Western New York.”

MAST is reporting that manufacturing in the region as a growing economy engine with the area hosting 1615 different facilities more than 70000 people employed $4.6 billion in payroll and benefits packaging and a $26 billion in annual shipping of finished product revenues.

One of the beneficial elements of the program is to provide a stream of qualified applicants to fill the void of workforce ready employees along with incentivizing appropriate school behavior and academic achievement.

“There’s always room for improvement” said Shawn Hricko local Cummins plant manager. “This program will hopefully enforce some of the qualities we’ve seen lacking in a recent trend of some of those coming out of high school. Such as punctuality high self-standards in quality of work resiliency with challenges problem solving skills critical thinking and other intangibles.”

Moreover the “Dream It Do It program” will target the 13- to 18-year-old demographics and partner with local area school districts to provide a two-way street of communication not only with the schools but the individual identified students as well.

“Enrolling our students with the Dream It Do It Advanced Manufacturing program provides an opportunity to create stronger connections to manufacturing pathways rewards students for their school-based work and engagement in hand-on programming through Dream it Do it and builds engagements directly with the manufactures” said Rachel Curtin Chautauqua Lake Center School principal.

While the program isn’t new to Cummins it’s something the Jamestown plant manager is excited to be part of.

“There’s some of the other plants I’m aware of that have the Dream It Do It program” Hricko said. “However I’m excited for it to be here. Cummins wants all our plants to be invested in our communities. To have a healthy plant we need to have healthy communities and we’re proud to be a part of this.”

When we think about how risky a company is we always like to look at its use of debt since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?

Why Does Debt Bring Risk?

Generally speaking debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. In the worst case scenario a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course debt can be an important tool in businesses particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels we first consider both cash and debt levels together.

View our latest analysis for CVS Health

What Is CVS Health's Net Debt?

The image below which you can click on for greater detail shows that at September 2023 CVS Health had debt of US$60.4b up from US$50.8b in one year. However because it has a cash reserve of US$16.2b its net debt is less at about US$44.2b.

How Healthy Is CVS Health's Balance Sheet?

We can see from the most recent balance sheet that CVS Health had liabilities of US$81.6b falling due within a year and liabilities of US$95.2b due beyond that. Offsetting this it had US$16.2b in cash and US$32.9b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$127.7b.

When you consider that this deficiency exceeds the company's huge US$86.1b market capitalization you might well be inclined to review the balance sheet intently. In the scenario where the company had to clean up its balance sheet quickly it seems likely shareholders would suffer extensive dilution.

We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.

CVS Health's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 2.4 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its strong interest cover of 10.7 times makes us even more comfortable. Sadly CVS Health's EBIT actually dropped 9.1% in the last year. If that earnings trend continues then its debt load will grow heavy like the heart of a polar bear watching its sole cub. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings more than anything that will determine CVS Health's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.

Story continues

Finally a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash not accounting profits. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last three years CVS Health actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash conversion gets us as excited as the crowd when the beat drops at a Daft Punk concert.

Our View

While CVS Health's level of total liabilities has us nervous. For example its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow and interest cover give us some confidence in its ability to manage its debt. We should also note that Healthcare industry companies like CVS Health commonly do use debt without problems. Taking the abovementioned factors together we do think CVS Health's debt poses some risks to the business. So while that leverage does boost returns on equity we wouldn't really want to see it increase from here. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that CVS Health is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis  you should know about...

According to legal documents CVS isn’t disputing what that couple says happened but the company is arguing that they’re protected under the law from being sued for the alleged mistake.

Keeping track of a daily pill concoction Julianna Preece takes a large combination of medications and vitamins prescribed and recommended by her doctor.

Standing at her kitchen counter in her Herriman home this week she pulled out all the bottles.

“These are my lifelines is what I call them” she said.

She also keeps track of a laundry list of health issues. Preece sat on her couch and pulled out a large stack of papers.

“This is my medical file as of today” she said sifting through the documents.

Preece opened a journal that is filled with her daily documentations of health issues she said she’s been experiencing the past two years.

“Any time there were side effects anything that I was experiencing through all this I would just note and keep track of” she explained.

Julianna and her husband Nic said the problems began during a trip to CVS in West Valley City in August 2021.

“It was just we’re going in for the COVID vaccine. It’s going to be a quick shot” Nic remembered. The couple had scheduled back-to-back appointments for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.

They said one nurse was training another nurse to give out the COVID-19 vaccines and that it was the first day the new nurse was administering the shots. The supervising nurse the couple said turned her back to the nurse-in-training and was typing on a computer not paying attention during the injection.

Julianna noticed it was taking a long time to inject the vaccine and it was really painful.

She said she made a comment about it and the nurse-in-training responded that it was a large shot. After it was over Julianna said the nurse-in-training asked the supervising nurse where to discard the vial.

The supervising nurse turned around and the couple could see her demeanor change.

“Their eyes got wide” Julianna remembers. She said the nurses quickly left the room. “And [Nic] noticed right off the bat that something wasn’t right. And he’s like ‘Something went wrong.'”

The two nurses re-entered the room Julianna and Nic said and explained that the nurse-in-training thought she was to inject Julianna with the whole vial. They said the nurse-in-training didn’t know each vial was meant to vaccinate five different people.

The nurses said: “‘You were given the wrong dosage.’ ‘You were given 2.5 and the standard dose is .5.'”

“The first reaction was like ‘What?! What do we do now?'” Nic remembers thinking. “Where do we go from here? You can’t exactly take it out.”

After administering five times the standard dose of the J&J vaccine the couple said the nurses monitored Julianna for about 45 minutes to an hour and talked to the pharmacy manager and manufacturer. There didn’t appear to be any guidance on how to handle the mistake the couple indicated and eventually CVS sent the couple home with instruction to go to the doctor or hospital if she felt ill.

Hours later Nic said he found Julianna slumped over in their living room.

“I picked her up and kind of helped her to the door. And right as we opened the door she just collapsed and passed out” he said. “It was stressful… I panicked.”

An ambulance took Julianna to the hospital where she said she remained for three days.

In the nearly two-and-a-half years since Julianna said she’s since experienced a myriad of sudden health issues: from mysterious intense and recurring stomach pains to breathing problems and heart palpitations.

Julianna who was an avid runner said she had just completed a half marathon before the vaccine. She can’t imagine doing that today.

“I still haven’t been able to run more than a couple of miles and I still feel like I’m going to have a heart attack” she said.

Last summer she said a doctor diagnosed her with the heart condition myocarditis which the CDC is currently investigating in relation to the vaccine. He prescribed medication to help her manager the condition.

“To this day she’s still not one hundred percent” Nic expressed. “And it’s just the question of will she ever be one hundred percent right? Or is this just her new way of life?”

“Do I just accept it?” Julianna echoed. “Or… will I ever be back?”

The couple said efforts to reach out to CVS have gone nowhere so their attorney has filed a lawsuit against the nurses and MinuteClinic which is the name of the vaccine clinic that CVS operates within its stores.

“Our thought was just to kind of figure out how to get her health back and get some the bills covered” Nic said.

CVS wants the lawsuit dismissed and attorneys for MinuteClinic filed a Motion to Dismiss in late November saying they believe MinuteClinic is covered under the Public and Emergency Preparedness Act part of the pandemic response.

“The PREP Act immunity preempts all of Plaintiffs’ claims and provides immunity from suit as well as liability of Defendants” the Motion to Dismiss states.

It outlines what’s in the PREP Act saying that immunity “applies to any claim for loss” and that loss includes “death physical mental or emotional injury illness disability.”

The Preece’s attorney is filing a response this week arguing CVS is wrong. He said the PREP Act applies when CDC guidelines are followed. In this case mistakenly giving five times the regular dose would not be considered following the guidelines he and the couple expressed.

“There’s a lot of steps and procedures that happen when you’re administering a vaccine or any other medical care. And it doesn’t seem like any of those were followed including the dosage amount” Nic said. “The nurse that was overseeing the training didn’t oversee the training wasn’t making sure she administered the shot correctly.”

The couple is asking for damages in the suit.

What Julianna is hoping for above all else: “Just that they take responsibility for it. I think that’s been my biggest thing.”

CVS sent KSL TV the following statement about the lawsuit:

“While we cannot comment on ongoing litigation MinuteClinic is dedicated to providing safe high-quality care. Our MinuteClinic clinicians comprised of board-certified family nurse practitioners physician assistants/associates and clinical support staff follow the most up-to-date clinical guidance as it relates to COVID-19 vaccine administration.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9jdnMtaGVhbHRocy1jdnMtZGlnaXRhbC1mb2N1cy0xNDU0MDAzNzguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,CVS Health's (CVS) Digital Focus Aids Growth Macro Issues Ail,"CVS Health CVS gains from digital health adoption.

Medical membership in the third quarter of 2023 grew to 25.7 million an increase of 1.4 million members versus the prior year reflecting growth across multiple product lines including individual exchange Medicare and commercial. CVS Health demonstrated strong growth led by significant progress made in restoring its Medicare Advantage Star ratings. Medicare Advantage is a key strategic growth area for the company’s business.

Herb Simon chairman and owner of Pacers Sports & Entertainment announced Thursday night that he is selling a 15% stake of the Indiana Pacers to billionaire Steve Rales.

The 72-year-old who founded the Danaher Corp. a life sciences company in 1984 and has become a movie producer already owned a 5% stake in the team.

According to Forbes Rales purchased the 15% at a $3.47 billion evaluation. In total $525.5 million was spent by Rales to now possess 20% of the franchise. Per the same report Rales has a real-time net worth of $7.5 billion.

Simon released a statement on X:

""My good friend Steven Rales who has strong Hoosier ties and is a graduate of DePauw University and co-founder of Danaher Corporation which is the owner of Indiana-based life sciences company Beckman Coulter expressed an interest in acquiring a minority of investment in the franchise.

After considerable discussion Steven is going to become a minority owner of 20% of the franchise pending league approval. Management of the franchise remains under the Simon family control. The Simon family is as committed to Indiana today as we have been since we moved here from New York in the 1960s.""

Forbes valued the Pacers at $2.9 million in October and Rales' worth at $7.5 billion. Rales serves as chairman of the board at Danaher which has become involved in several industries and had around $31.5 billion in sales in 2022. Danaher focuses on tax avoidance and cash flow according to Forbes.

Rales founded the Indian Paintbrush movie production company in 2006 and it has worked frequently with director Wes Anderson including on this year's 'Asteroid City.'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zaS5jb20vbmJhL3BhY2Vycy9uZXdzL3N0ZXZlbi1yYWxlcy1wdXJjaGFzZXMtMTUtaW5kaWFuYS1wYWNlcnMtZnJvbS1oZXJiZXJ0LXNpbW9uLW5vdy1vd25zLTIwLXBlcmNlbnQtdGVhbS1wZW5kaW5nLW5iYS1hcHByb3ZhbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steven Rales purchases 15% of Indiana Pacers from Herbert Simon now owns 20% of the team pending NBA approval,"On Thursday evening Indiana Pacers chairman and owner Herbert Simon shared that he has agreed to a deal with Steven Rales that will make Rales a 20% minority owner of the Pacers.

Sportico reported that such an agreement existed earlier in the day. According to Sportico Rales already owned 5% of the franchise so his new investment brings his ownership percentage up to 20% in total.

Sportico's report also details that the purchase is being made at a franchise valuation of $3.47 billion. 15% of that number is $520 million.

""My good friend Steven Rales who has strong Hoosier ties and is a graduate of DePauw University and co-founder of Danaher Corporation which is the owner of Indiana-based life sciences company Beckman Coulter expressed an interest in acquiring a minority investment in the franchise"" Simon shared in a statement. ""After considerable discussion Steven is going to become a minority owner of 20% of the franchise pending league approval. Management of the franchise remains under Simon family control. The Simon family is as committed to Indiana today as we have been since we moved here from New York in the 1960's.""

The Simon family has owned the Pacers since 1983 meaning they have helped grow the franchise for the last 40 years. Herbert's son Stephen Simon is on the board of directors of the Pacers Basketball Corporation and has a role with a franchise.

According to Sportico the agreement between Simon and Rales ""includes a possible path to control for Rales should the Simon family ever choose to sell."" If the Pacers are ever for sale Rales would have an advantage over other bidders.

Rales' net worth per Forbes is $7.5 billion. His Indiana connections are presumably appealing to Simon who founded the Indianapolis-headquartered Simon Property Group more than 30 years ago. Rales went to Depauw University which is in Greencastle Indiana.

Herbert Simon is now 89 years old. When Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle signed his contract extension with the franchise in late October he thanked Rales as well as the Simons for their commitment to the Pacers.

Indiana is 9-8 this season and sits in seventh place in the Eastern Conference.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbmFoZXIuY29tL2VtcGxveWVlLWxlZC1pbm5vdmF0aW9uLWRyaXZlcy1kYW5haGVyLWZvcndhcmTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Employee-led Innovation Drives Danaher Forward,"Shane Swinehart had never given much thought to polystyrene. As a Site Leader for Danaher’s Cytiva office in New Zealand he viewed the material — known as Styrofoam —as an effective industry-standard tool for ensuring the company’s therapies were packaged and shipped to healthcare providers at the right temperature and without incident. In 2019 however an underwater excursion irrevocably changed his perspective.

“I was on a diving trip with my family in Indonesia and I saw dozens of fish and sea turtles eating plastic—it was distressing” said Swinehart.

In therapeutics temperature is key to delivering lifesaving vaccines and therapeutics. From COVID-19 boosters to shingles vaccines the industry relies on cold packs chilled boxes and other specialized packaging — especially polystyrene — to ensure global and domestic shipments meet cold shipping regulations so products are still viable when they reach patients. But while polystyrene is effective in healthcare shipments it can pose a significant threat to wildlife: it makes up for 10-40 percent of plastics found in waterways and is littered more than any other waste product.

“Witnessing this kind of pollution firsthand I knew I had to do something” said Swinehart “Everyone has a voice at Danaher — I wanted to use mine to create a healthier planet for all of its inhabitants.”

A bold ambition

At Danaher associates’ perspectives are welcomed and invited when it comes to sustainability prioritization and innovation. In fact hundreds of associates played a role in shaping the company’s sustainability strategy in 2022 helping the organization determine which efforts were mission critical to the business and the planet—including investment in a more sustainable supply chain.

For Swinehart the ability to enact company-wide change became possible faster than he imagined thanks to Cytiva’s inaugural Innovation Accelerator Program. In January 2020 Cytiva invested more than $3 million to launch the accelerator program which aims to source and scale in-house innovation by addressing timely challenges within the pharmaceutical industry.



The first challenge? Identifying business opportunities that could help benefit the environment.

Swinehart’s idea was to remove polystyrene from the Cytiva supply chain in Australia and New Zealand—a vision requiring access to global data and resources.

Enter colleagues Brandon Papke and Thibault Renaud. These two Cytiva associates based in the U.S. and France respectively paired up with Swinehart to create a project team they dubbed “Cargo Kiwi”. Papke a Materials Control Manager and Renaud a Global Sustainability Supply Chain Leader leveraged their collective expertise to collaborate with customers and suppliers on finding a sustainable solution.

What started as a smaller scale multimarket approach however quickly became an ambitious proposal to replace all polystyrene packaging around the world. “Cargo Kiwi became one of six finalists selected by investors to receive funding for a year” said Papke. “To our surprise we were given the time resources and expertise we needed to test and create a prototype that could be rolled out across all markets.”

From idea to impact

After months of meticulous testing and collaboration with Cytiva’s packaging partner TemperPack Cargo Kiwi’s concept became a commercial reality in April 2023. Cytiva announced the launch of a recyclable and 90 percent renewable packaging solution that would replace polystyrene with new liners primarily made from paper and corn starch.

“Working side by side with my colleagues was inspiring and speaks to the power of collaboration and different perspectives” said Renaud. “Having leaders from different regions come together to bring this solution to life allowed us to expand our impact to a global scale.”

By 2025 polystyrene will be eliminated from Cytiva packaging completely supporting Danaher’s ambitious waste reduction goal to reduce the amount of non-hazardous non-regulated waste sent to landfill by 15 percent. Once this packaging solution deploys globally by the end of 2024 an estimated 60000 polystyrene boxes will be eliminated from the environment each year—the equivalent of 71 ocean shipping containers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vY2JzNmFsYmFueS5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC90aHJlZS1jaGFyZ2VkLWluLWNvbm5lY3Rpb24td2l0aC1ub3ZlbWJlci1zdGFiYmluZy1pbi1zY2h1eWxlcnZpbGxl0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9jYnM2YWxiYW55LmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC90aHJlZS1jaGFyZ2VkLWluLWNvbm5lY3Rpb24td2l0aC1ub3ZlbWJlci1zdGFiYmluZy1pbi1zY2h1eWxlcnZpbGxl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Three charged in connection with November stabbing in Schuylerville,"Three people have been arrested in connection with a stabbing in Schuylerville.

The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one delivering an average surprise of 3.03%.

Let’s delve deeper.

Strength in Robotics: We are upbeat about Intuitive Surgical’s robot-based da Vinci surgical system that enables minimally-invasive surgery and reduces the trauma associated with open surgery. The da Vinci System is powered by robotic technology that has provided the company with solid exposure to medical mechatronics robotics and AI for the healthcare space.

On ISRG’s third-quarter 2023 earnings call the installed base of the da Vinci system grew approximately 13% year over year. The utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system was up 6% from the prior-year quarter’s level.

Progress on the AI Front: We are also positive about the growing adoption of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries self-automated home-based care the use of information technology for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model. These indicate the high prevalence of AI in the MedTech space.

Per management the rise of medical mechatronics powerful computing improved sensing microfabrication and molecular imaging have enabled new solutions to old problems. AI has been enhancing Intuitive Surgical’s product portfolio with clinical applications diagnostic support operational efficiency electronic health record systems practice workflows and supply-chain management.

Strong Q3 Results: ISRG’s solid third-quarter 2023 results also buoy optimism. Revenues were primarily driven by continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume. Intuitive Surgical has also been raising the price of procedures to fight inflationary pressure that also aided sales growth.

Story continues

Meanwhile the absence of any significant disruptions from COVID-19 during the third quarter seems promising which may accelerate procedure growth going forward. Although gross margin contracted operating margin improved during the third quarter (as anticipated). The declining trend in operating expenses is likely to continue in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Downsides

Risk of Procedure Adoption: Intuitive Surgical faces the risk of adoption of its procedures. This is because adoption growth takes time as each procedure needs to gain credibility. Furthermore the wide use of the company’s products requires training of surgical teams. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete such trainings.

To keep plants healthy farmers must kill weeds because they steal the vital nutrients plants need to grow into a healthy crop. Before AI farmers had to spray the entire field to get rid of the weeds. But today See & Spray can detect where every weed is in the field and apply herbicide only where it's needed. And the machine continues to teach itself with images collected to become even more accurate in new scenarios such as new field conditions different plant growth stages and plant diseases.

We see AI — specifically computer vision and machine learning — as essential to helping farmers address these challenges. Computer vision helps farmers see beyond human capacity and machine learning helps them make more accurate decisions at a tremendous scale.

Hindman: Ever since the steel plow we've had one goal in mind: to help farmers do more with less to meet the basic needs of our ever-growing population. Especially as they face challenges like constantly changing weather conditions limited land suitable for farming and continued workforce shortages.

CNBC: Let's start with the big picture. I know John Deere has been working on automation for years now and that improving efficiency has been at the heart of the company since John Deere himself introduced the steel plow in 1837. How have advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning specifically changed the way John Deere is innovating now?

Hindman recently provided CNBC with a look at how the ag giant thinks about AI ahead of the CNBC Work Summit on December 6. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Jahmy Hindman is senior vice president & chief technology officer of Deere & Company  a position he has held since July 2020. He is responsible for building Deere's ""tech stack"" the company's intuitive end-to-end equipment solution made up of hardware and devices embedded software connectivity data platforms and applications. He leads the company's Intelligent Solutions Group its global network of technology/innovations centers and the shared engineering function.

As AI continues to evolve we'll create smarter more efficient and more automated machines. They will help farmers care for every plant in every square foot of their field. It will make every job on the farm more productive and profitable. AI will also help us reach our goal of creating a fully autonomous production cycle for corn and soybean farmers by 2030. This means crops can be planted sprayed and harvested with autonomous technology. To reach this goal we'll continue deploying AI — along with robotics sensors data and connectivity — to meet our customers' most pressing needs.

Importantly we're also developing these solutions for machines already in the field to make them more productive. An example of this is the ability to retrofit See & Spray technology onto a sprayer built in 2018. With this approach farmers with older machines can benefit from the newest technologies at a lower upfront cost and pay only for what they need through a ""solutions as a service"" model. This makes it easier for farmers to adopt and implement new technologies.

CNBC: Apart from some of the obvious benefits to farmers themselves what are some of the global implications of these technological advances? Thinking of things like decreasing food insecurity in places where growing is particularly difficult reduced carbon footprints water conservation.

Hindman: The global population is expected to reach 10 billion by 2050 and as diets improve farmers must double crop production to provide enough food for everyone. But with constantly changing environmental conditions it is harder for farmers to depend on past knowledge and experience. And global agriculture employment has declined over the past decade down to 26% of total employment in 2021 compared to 43% in 1991. So farmers have more work to do with less predictability and less help.

However farmers are the original stewards of the land and know it is important to protect land and resources for future generations. Technology helps them meet current demands without sacrificing sustainability. Going back to See & Spray since farmers can precisely spray weeds rather than their entire field they reduce herbicide use by approximately 66%. Similarly farmers can reduce starter fertilizer use by 60% by using sensing technology during planting. Just looking at corn production fertilizer accounts for a large portion of total greenhouse gas emissions. By integrating technology with agriculture machines we're seeing an immediate measurable impact on our environment.

CNBC: The adage that ""every company is a tech company"" has never felt more apt. Talk to us about your approach to recruiting hiring and retaining talent? What's the pitch to data scientists coders and software engineers who might otherwise be looking at Big Tech jobs? Why John Deere?

Hindman: Technology like AI and autonomy isn't a new concept at Deere. It is essential and already in fields with farmers today. But that's only possible because of our heavy investment in innovation and our commitment to hiring and working with the best tech talent. That's what makes recruiting and developing diverse teams of talent essential to our strategy and core values. It's also what drives us to be an engineering and data-centric organization.

For data scientists software engineers and other tech-centric workers considering their next career move I recommend pursuing a job in agriculture technology – and specifically at Deere – because it's an opportunity to create something that benefits everyone in the world. You can innovate with existing technologies like IoT connectivity robotics and sensors or you can get ahead of the technology curve and bring new use cases to life. Regardless of what you're working on you're reminded of our purpose at every meal.

To function autonomously Targerson notes that the tractor also relies on John Deere tractor components and applications that farmers already know well including a StarFire receiver and AutoTrac turn automation.

“Everything is done through our John Deere Operations Center” says Targerson. “That’s the heartbeat of the system. They’re able to go onto John Deere Ops Center make a path plan and see where their tractor is at all times.” He adds that farmers can manage an autonomous tractor directly from their mobile device. “It’s a simple swipe on their phone and they’ll be able to have the tractor run autonomously.”

In the interview below Targerson tells RealAgriculture’s Bernard Tobin that farmers who’ve worked with Deere autonomous tractors have noted how it can reduce labour demands. Alternatively farmers can reallocate labour required for tractor operations more strategically to tackle farm management tasks. (Story continues after the video.)

Targerson says the company is currently working to extend autonomous features to other models throughout its tractor line-up. He also notes that much of the early work on the technology has focused on functionality in corn and soybean crops but farmers can expect to the see the autonomous Deere tractors working in small grains crops in near future.

It seemed like a deal could be announced soon but crickets.

Then in late spring major media picked up on the story that Delta was looking to buy both Airbus A350-1000s and Airbus A330neos. Now that order appears out to happen – this month.

Though Delta placed an order for Boeing 737 MAXs the airline mostly buys Airbus and currently operates about 67 Airbus A330 and 28 A350-900 widebodies with another 16 and 14 of each on order respectively. They used taxpayer bailout money to buy 10 of their European A350s.

Now things appear to be heating up with aviation watchdog JonNYC reporting that an order for new Airbus widebody planes should be announced in the coming weeks and before end of year.

And the A350 still seems like the path to Dubai and India (obviously among other places DL wants to serve.) — JonNYC (@xJonNYC) December 1 2023

No doubt Airbus would like to close the year strong after Boeing managed to announce 295 aircraft orders at the Dubai Air Show last month against just 86 from Airbus.

Delta historically has preferred acquiring used planes and keeping those flying with an effective TechOps business leading to an especially old fleet. They’ve also strategically purchased aircraft at low prices. The airline was primarily a Boeing carrier before their merger with Northwest so it turns out that the coup in selling A320 family planes to Northwest continues to pay massive dividends.

These new long haul aircraft might fly to India Dubai Melbourne and even signal a return to Singapore and other long haul destinations in Asia that are currently served only over Seoul by joint venture partner Korean Air. It’s the A350-1000 that Delta is speculated to be looking at.

The A350-1000 is the largest current Airbus widebody aircraft in production. In its densest form it can seat up to 480 passengers (up from a previous maximum of 440) in a configuration delivered to low cost long haul carrier French Bee. A much more passenger-generous Airbus A350-1000 will be used for Qantas ultra-long haul ‘Project Sunrise’ flights.

While Airbus touts a fuel burn advantage against the Boeing 777-300ER and planned 777-9 it’s a large aircraft that makes sense on dense routes like U.S. – Europe when airports like London Heathrow and Amsterdam have capacity restrictions in place or seasonally between large markets like New York and Paris but risk driving down yields substantially to fill in many other uses.

This is interesting as flagged by @xJonNYC.

Delta encourages asking pilots for trading cards

On November 20 2023 Delta Air Lines posted to its official TikTok account promoting how the company’s pilots have aircraft specific trading cards. The 12-second TikTok video has text that reads “pov: you always ask the pilots for a trading card.”

Fun fact: you can ask your Delta Airlines pilot for their secret trading cards



pic.twitter.com/4coBzjF5rQ — Dexerto (@Dexerto) November 30 2023

The video then shows a variety of aircraft-specific trading cards. Not only does Delta seem to have one for each aircraft type but I guess the airline has actually been printing these for a couple of decades and has different versions of them. Someone is even trying to sell the complete set of 62 cards on eBay for $3000 (lol).

This is a cute initiative on Delta’s part. It’s a fun idea for aviation geeks and children and it creates a way for pilots to interact with passengers adding a human touch that’s often missing in the travel experience.

Now in fairness Delta actually isn’t the only airline to have trading cards. Frontier Airlines’ aircraft are themed after animals and passengers can ask the crew for a collectable trading card for that specific aircraft. For an airline that has a charge for printing boarding passes I’d say that’s pretty generous.

Delta’s trading cards are going viral in a strange way

I imagine that when Delta posted on TikTok about these trading cards the expectation was that not many people would actually request these cards outside of true aviation geeks and maybe parents with small children.

But I guess TikTok works in strange ways. With Delta’s post on this having gone so viral some popular TikTok users have filmed themselves asking Delta pilots for trading cards.

For example vicblends who has millions of followers across social media platforms filmed himself going to the cockpit and asking Delta pilots for trading cards. He’s not the only one as several other people have posted similar videos.

Have you seen this? ✈️@Delta Airlines trading cards! Have you collected any? 📹: Sarowarrr on TikTok pic.twitter.com/Hy0wkxybey — CollX: Sports Card Scanner (@CollX_App) November 27 2023

A few thoughts:

This is bound to lead to some disappointment since I can’t help but wonder how consistently Delta pilots carry these; in the videos I’ve seen posted typically one pilot doesn’t even have the cards

Airlines are so focused on efficient and punctual boarding so if this at all catches on and becomes a thing on every flight it will add some congestion during the boarding process

I love the idea behind this and that Delta is encouraging it but for whatever reason this seems to be more of a source of social media content and a flex for random adults which is an odd direction for this to take

I’m curious to see if this is just a short-lived social trend or if this becomes something bigger. Regardless it’s a great idea for aviation geeks and those with children.

Bottom line

Maybe I’ve just been living under a rock or didn’t get the memo but apparently Delta pilots have had trading cards for years which passengers can simply ask for. Delta posted about this on TikTok recently and it probably got more attention than the Atlanta-based airline was expecting.

What’s perhaps most interesting is the crowd with which this has caught on. It’s not your typical avgeek or kids but rather adults who are somehow amazed that they can get a free trading card on their next flight.

I love this initiative and concept I’m just confused about the way that interest is evolving…

Fervo and Google signed the world’s first corporate agreement to develop next-generation geothermal power in 2021 aiming to power Google’s Cloud region in Las Vegas with an “always-on” carbon-free resource that will reduce the company’s hourly reliance on fossil fuels. The start of operations at the Nevada geothermal plant contributes to Google’s goal of operating its data centers and office campuses on 24/7 carbon-free energy on the grids where it operates by 2030 the company said in a news release.

In July Fervo successfully completed a well test to confirm the commercial viability of using oil and gas drilling technology for geothermal energy in its commercial pilot project named Project Red which the company said established the project as “the most productive enhanced geothermal system in history”.

At the Nevada project site Fervo dug two horizontal wells and installed fiber-optic cables to capture data that shows the flow temperature and performance of the geothermal system in real-time resulting in a geothermal plant that can produce round-the-clock carbon-free energy using less land than other clean energy sources and drawing on skills knowledge and supply chains that exist in other industries Google said.

In a bid to further advance geothermal technologies Google also announced a partnership with Project InnerSpace a leading non-profit organization dedicated to the global development of geothermal energy to accelerate the adoption of geothermal energy.

New Geothermal Project in Utah

Meanwhile Fervo began its exploration drilling campaign at Cape Station a next-generation geothermal energy project set to deliver 400 megawatts of 24/7 carbon-free electricity. Located in Beaver County Utah Cape Station will begin delivering around-the-clock clean power to the grid in 2026 and reach full-scale production in 2028 Fervo said in a separate news release.

According to the release Utah is home to immense geothermal potential with researchers estimating the southwest portion of the state to contain more than 10 gigawatts of high-quality geothermal reserves. Cape Station will also benefit from the Department of Energy’s Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) which has completed research that has dramatically advanced geothermal development in the region in the last six years Fervo said.

“Beaver County Utah is the perfect place to deploy our next-generation geothermal technology” Fervo CEO and Co-Founder Tim Latimer said. “The warmth and hospitality we have experienced from the communities of Milford and Beaver have allowed us to embark on a clean energy journey none of us could have imagined just a few years ago. Thanks to cutting edge research and data collection from FORGE Fervo can accelerate the production of the region’s geothermal resources”.

Fervo noted that it is working with experienced oil and gas companies including Helmerich & Payne Devon Energy and Liberty Energy.

In February the Utah Bureau of Land Management (BLM) approved the project’s first environmental assessment (EA) issuing a Finding of No Significant Impact pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act which allowed Fervo to start exploration activities at the Cape Station site.

Utah Governor Spencer Cox said “Utah is no stranger to energy leadership. For decades oil and gas workers in the Uinta Basin have produced energy vital to the growth of not just our state but our nation. Geothermal innovations like those pioneered by Fervo will play a critical role in extending Utah’s energy leadership for generations to come”.

Fervo’s projects support the findings of the USA Department of Energy’s (DOE) Enhanced Geothermal Earthshot. The Enhanced Geothermal Earthshot initiative aims to bring enhanced geothermal systems to the country by reducing its cost by 90 percent to $45 per megawatt-hour by 2035. Fervo earlier said that geothermal energy could supply over 20 percent of U.S. power needs and complement wind and solar to reach a fully decarbonized grid.

Throughout my career I’ve been able to witness great change in our industry as the shale revolution took hold making horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing commonplace diagnostic and modeling tools improved in access and cost and data became more timely and readily available. This led to a tremendous period of US energy supply growth and decades-long productivity improvements.

Looking forward I believe there are three trends that engineers should consider: 1) applying “new” tools to solve “old” problems 2) connecting the dots via hybrid engineering and 3) organizing directing and inserting data predictions into their workflow. These are not only my views but also the views of Devon’s talented engineers.

Old problems will meet new solutions. The past decade has been dominated by unconventional horizontal development that was first pioneered in the Barnett Shale for natural gas and shortly thereafter transitioned into oil-focused development in the Bakken and Eagle Ford. Today the Permian Basin continues to grow in total supply as the stacked pay is developed.

Engineers should take stock of the tool set we have acquired during this era with a mindset to deploy these methodologies to tier II unconventional extensions previously developed or bypassed conventional formations offshore and international opportunities enhanced recovery projects such as EOR and refracturing and new energy opportunities like geothermal. To make these future opportunities competitive and meet the global demand for energy we will likely need a combination of price technology and cost improvements.

Engineers are critical to the latter two. To better illustrate these points let’s utilize examples. Drilling rig specification improvements have been coupled with material science and design improvements in bottomhole assemblies. The outcome is improved topdrives and mud pressure systems to power more durable and efficient downhole motors and bits thus reducing failures enhancing the efficiency of a rig’s daily footage and enabling longer laterals. If we pivot to the completion space our diagnostics for frac geometry have gone from limited and costly to a menu of options that provide fit-for-purpose diagnostics and costs.

Devon deployed its first permanent fiber diagnostics in unconventional shale in 2012. Today the same system is readily available but for a much lower cost. However more frequently Devon has supplemented this tool with dip-in fiber and a proprietary methodology called sealed wellbore pressure monitoring to gather more frequent data points for frac geometry and design. As our team conducted in cooperation with the US Department of Energy (DOE) a novel Eagle Ford project capturing horizontal core and completion diagnostics we recognized that our designs have tremendously improved in efficiency but still have potential to capture more of the resource via initial and secondary fracturing efforts.

If we consider the production space a tool that has been within our systems for years is SCADA. This system historically was a controls system. During the past 2 decades it has provided the first step in a system streaming data coupled with evermore sensors and visual cameras to enable our local decision support center in each asset. These centers now serve as the brains of our field operations remotely monitoring dispatching repairs and optimizing wells daily. These efforts have led to the upskilling of our field staff and increased our efficiencies on a well count per team member basis.

These are just a few examples as to how we at Devon have transformed during the shale era and this mindset should be the foundation for unlocking future industry challenges.

Hybrid engineering melds the skills of different disciplines into an improved solution. As I reflect on my own experience one of the big changes in the shale era has been the segregation of engineering skills to build deeper capabilities. Engineers might have originally held responsibilities spanning two capabilities perhaps three e.g. drilling completions facilities production reservoir and planning. The eventual segregation of job scope was beneficial as growing knowledge catalyzed segment improvements which were important as we migrated to more robust development plans.

The future trend for engineers will be the ability to meld disciplines and integrate tools to unlock more resource recovery per unit of cost. To illustrate consider the following examples.

Subsurface optimization epitomizes the challenges of past and future development decisions. In a single-zone greenfield development well spacing and completion design interact to achieve an economic outcome. This situation becomes more complicated when you contemplate multiple zones with connected flow units necessitating decisions about vertical spacing sequencing and the effects of co-development or lack thereof on future development. Finally layer in the effects of time as most operations contain a previously developed well that has undergone depletion.

These are the type of challenges that only hybrid engineers can overcome. We must marry our historical experiences and learnings with future challenges across multiple disciplines to yield custom solutions. Predicting well performance has become progressively more difficult as solely relying on offset wells to inform forecasts is the way of the past. An integrated team however can distill the most informative variables in a grand multivariate problem to yield better solutions.

If we pivot from the subsurface to the surface the combination of increasingly complex facilities addition of emission reduction and monitoring expectations and the growing need for electricity has had a profound effect on the job scope of a facility engineer. Now our engineers must give forethought to working with power providers or in some cases microgrids and local power generation which require decisions years in advance of production. The inclusion of onsite continuous monitoring sensors for optimization and emissions purposes elevates the coordination to design the equipment. Lastly the economic efficiencies of connecting multiple units into a single site must be balanced with the design requirements of varying well tie-in timing and peak rates.

As these examples illustrate a hybrid engineer will have to integrate multiple challenges both internal and external to routinely design custom solutions. I expect engineers who can connect the dots will have outsized influence on teams.

Data and a future with AI. Data has been a transformational change during my career. I recall data being gathered by hand and other times via technicians who would input it into spreadsheets. Our historical systems were designed for low-quality and low-volume data. Fortunately great change has happened as wellsites stream data from the subsurface and surface to organized data management systems.

When I asked engineers about the future of the industry they all mentioned data and AI. To make it actionable I simplify this effect into two skills: data conditioning and predictions.

Data conditioning is the skill of using data science packages to gather and characterize data to feed predictions. Predictions are the output of algorithms from simple multi-what if equations to deep learning honing the algorithm based on dynamic situations and previous prediction outcomes.

The component connecting these two skill sets will be the act of coding. Coding once reserved as a niche skill set will be a ubiquitous tool for engineers. That change can sound daunting; however as Devon’s engineers have demonstrated the advance in large language models lessens the barrier to coding.

A holistic example is how Devon has made important changes to train and lower the barrier to skill development. We have initiated a data science cohort boot camp for our team members. Within this camp experts in data engineering architecture and science instruct our team members and eventually coach participants to a final business project.

A production engineer recently highlighted his results in a broad forum to reinforce the approach to “learn do share.” This specific project captured the task of compression optimization. A necessary task in the present becomes more proactive and efficient with data improvements and AI.

For context compression optimization is a task that engineers undertake as volumes decline and equipment becomes oversized incurring unnecessary costs. By connecting data from operations supply chain and financial accounting our team can rapidly scan the field for optimization projects and prioritize. Although this is a simple example imagine the effects of scale with multiple assets in a decentralized field structure overseeing hundreds of compressor units. The engineer’s purpose didn’t change; the process for the task did though.

Data and AI will change our industry for the better. At the root of this change will be the empowerment of engineers to make better decisions.

In closing I want to reflect on why I first became an engineer. The intersection of solving problems with brilliant and diverse people and global relevance provided the fuel to become an engineer. Looking forward given the right tools and support I’m confident our skills will be needed to provide energy to power the world the challenges will be as rewarding as ever and the people will make the journey memorable.

(Bloomberg) – Oil tycoon Tim Dunn has spent millions to try to influence Texas to lean toward his conservative politics. Now as he considers bids for his drilling company that’s said to be valued at more than $10 billion amid a merger-mania in the shale patch Dunn is poised for a windfall that could dramatically boost his giving – and his influence.

The head of CrownRock LP is a devout Christian who has bankrolled candidates and groups that favor his conservative beliefs. He is a patron for immigration hardliners who have pushed to block illegal “asylum-seekers” from crossing the U.S. southern border.

When Republicans are not sufficiently conservative by Dunn’s measuring he and his allies in the state recruit and fund primary challengers who meet their standards.

Those tactics are sure to make Dunn a potent force in the 2024 election pulling candidates to the right in races up and down the ballot in the second-most populous U.S. state. His dollars could also shape the presidential contest: He has backed GOP frontrunner Donald Trump before contributing $300000 to his 2020 reelection effort. He has not donated this cycle to Trump or any other presidential candidate.

It’s not certain that Dunn would use proceeds from an acquisition to ratchet up his political donations. Officials at his company declined to comment about its potential sale. But close observers of Texas politics say they expect his giving could increase if he sells his company.

Wherever Dunn decides to flex his political muscle he’ll have the help of former Trump digital strategist Brad Parscale who has relocated to the West Texas desert and is consulting for an advertising company that a Securities and Exchange Commission filing shows Dunn has financed.

Since 2011 Dunn has made political donations to candidates and committees at the federal level and in Texas totaling $31.9 million. He was the nation’s 65th-largest donor to super political action committees in the 2022 election cycle according to OpenSecrets.

Power broker. A wave of consolidation in the shale industry could soon make Dunn an even more formidable power broker: The likes of Occidental Petroleum Corp. Devon Energy Corp. and Diamondback Energy have eyed closely held CrownRock as an acquisition target according to people familiar with the situation who were not authorized to discuss the matter because the bidding process is private.

A sale would score its owners — which include Dunn and private equity firm Lime Rock Partners — a massive payout. It could also have lasting implications for Texas’s political landscape.

“If he pulls this off he can seriously change politics for the next 10 years” said Republican donor Bryan Sheffield a prominent figure in the Texas oil industry and billionaire founder of Parsley Energy who regularly donates to Republican candidates.

Dunn 67 who delivers sermons at an evangelical church in his hometown of Midland Texas and founded a private Christian school stands apart from other big Texas GOP donors – including pipeline magnate Kelcy Warren and real estate mogul Harlan Crow — because the interests of his industry don’t appear to be the primary driver of his giving.

“It’s been much more with an ideological and policy agenda” for Dunn said Mark Jones a political science professor at Rice University in Houston.

Lasting Franchise . Dunn grew up just outside Midland in Big Spring Texas on a flat expanse of the Chihuahuan Desert. His father was a farmer who never graduated high school. Dunn became an Eagle Scout played guitar in a rock band and married his wife after their junior year at Texas Tech.

In an October address from his church’s pulpit Dunn warned the congregation against being overly focused on immediate gratification.

“The best investments take time” he said.

Dunn certainly has shown patience in building his own business empire. It has taken more than a decade to grow CrownRock into one of the Permian basin’s most-prized assets.

Through Dunn’s other company – CrownQuest Operating LLC which manages the assets of CrownRock – production has climbed by 15% through the first six months of this year according to industry data provider Enverus. That’s on top of last year’s 21% output growth and the 36% expansion in 2020 according to CrownQuest.

With core inventory spread across 94000 net acres CrownQuest is tied with Double Eagle Energy Holdings IV LLC as the second-most active private driller with five rigs working in the Midland basin of the Permian.

“He’s built a lasting franchise” said Steve Pruett a Midland oil explorer who has known Dunn for roughly three decades.

Indeed five of his six children work in the oil sector. (The one who isn’t in the business David Dunn is a Christian singer-songwriter. The father and son jam together sometimes with the elder picking the guitar or mandolin.)

More than a decade after the shale revolution upended global energy markets some companies have exhausted their most prolific rocks and are moving to scoop up quality replacements. That’s what Exxon Mobil Corp. did this fall when it agreed to purchase Pioneer Natural Resources the Permian’s biggest independent producer for $60 billion.

Against that backdrop Dunn is weighing a sale of CrownRock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAxL29jY2lkZW50YWwtcGV0cm9sZXVtLWNvdWxkLXNvb24tZm9sbG93LWV4eG9uLWFuZC1jL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Occidental Petroleum Could Soon Follow Exxon and Chevron by Making a Needle-Moving Acquisition,"Occidental Petroleum could make a needle-moving deal.

Occidental Petroleum (OXY 0.12%) could be nearing a deal to buy privately held oil producer CrownRock. The Wall Street Journal reported that the oil giant was in the lead to buy the Permian Basin producer. The deal could be worth more than $10 billion.

The potential deal would be the latest in a wave of merger activity in the oil patch. ExxonMobil (XOM -0.07%) and Chevron (CVX -0.48%) closed multibillion-dollar acquisitions this year and have since agreed to even larger transactions. That's spurring rivals to consider deals of their own to keep up with those energy giants.

In the lead to buy a prized producer

Occidental is one of several oil companies linked to CrownRock in recent weeks. Reuters reported last month that ConocoPhillips was weighing an offer for CrownRock. Meanwhile Devon Energy Diamondback Energy Marathon Oil and Continental Resources have all looked into buying CrownRock. Given the intense interest talks with Occidental might not lead to a deal if one of those rivals or another suitor swoops in at the last moment.

The big draw with CrownRock is its sizable position in the Permian Basin. The company owns more than 80000 acres in the northern part of the Midland Basin. It currently produces about 150000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) from that position. Buying CrownRock would enable the acquirer to meaningfully increase their scale in the resource-rich Permian. That would allow them to spread costs over a larger position increasing their profit margin.

Occidental is already one of the largest players in the Permian. The company holds 2.8 million acres. Overall it produces 588000 BOE/d from its position in the Permian. Acquiring CrownRock would enable Occidental to further increase its scale in the region and leverage its existing position to reduce costs.

Getting bigger and better

Scale has been the main driver of the current wave of mergers in the oil patch. Exxon is paying over $60 billion to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources to boost its scale in the Permian. The deal will more than double Exxon's acreage position in the region (adding 850000 net acres to its existing 570000 net-acre position). It will also more than double its Permian production to a combined 1.3 million BOE/d. Exxon believes its enhanced scale will enable it to earn double-digit returns as it recovers more resources more efficiently.

Scale also drove Chevron's $7.6 billion deal for PDC Energy. It significantly enhanced Chevron's position in the DJ Basin where it added 275000 net acres. Meanwhile it added 25000 acres to its position in the Permian. That increased scale drives Chevron's expectation it will capture about $100 million in cost savings while adding about $1 billion in annual free cash flow. Meanwhile the company's $60 billion deal for Hess should enable it to capture around $1 billion in cost savings.

An acquisition of CrownRock could enable its acquirer to achieve meaningful cost savings by streamlining development plans leveraging existing infrastructure and spreading costs over a larger position. That's why so many oil companies are interested in CrownRock.

Only one oil company will emerge victorious in the bidding for CrownRock. That will likely lead its other suitors to look elsewhere for a needle-moving deal. Some could seek to join forces -- Devon and Marathon have reportedly held merger talks -- while others will likely look at another private producer potentially circling back to see if Endeavor Energy Resources is now ready to sell.

The next wave is about to hit

Occidental Petroleum is reportedly in the lead to acquire CrownRock. A potential tie-up between the two would enhance Occidental's already strong position in the Permian further increasing its scale. The conclusion of that auction process would likely lead other suitors to look elsewhere for a deal so that they don't lose out on the opportunity to participate in what's becoming a major consolidation wave in the sector."

Strategic buyouts should drive future growth. However reimbursement pressure and macroeconomic headwinds provide stiff challenges to CVS Health. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

CVS Health is continuously focusing and investing in fast-growing spaces like enterprise data platforms cloud capabilities and digital products to offer innovative solutions through mobile and web channels. The company is investing in emerging technology capabilities such as voice artificial intelligence and robotics to automate reduce the cost and improve the experience for its constituents.



In terms of the latest update the company exceeded 55 million unique digital customers till the third quarter an increase of nearly 20% versus last year. This strong growth has been powered by its focus on innovating and delivering experiences that matter most to customers.

Further following the colossal acquisition of the health insurance giant Aetna CVS Health has introduced its Health Care Benefits business arm. This segment consistently demonstrates value to consumers and clients by successfully managing drug cost trends and bringing innovative clinical solutions to the market.

Medical membership in the third quarter of 2023 grew to 25.7 million an increase of 1.4 million members versus the prior year reflecting growth across multiple product lines including individual exchange Medicare and commercial. CVS Health demonstrated strong growth led by significant progress made in restoring its Medicare Advantage Star ratings. Medicare Advantage is a key strategic growth area for the company’s business.



Within Health Service both Signify Health and Oak Street Health continue to deliver strong business performance consistent with expectations. These assets bring core capabilities to the multi-payor value-based care platform that drives optimal patient engagement with health services across multiple channels.

Meanwhile a significant portion of CVS Health’s net revenues are derived directly from Medicare Medicaid and other government-sponsored healthcare programs. Therefore the company is subject to federal and state reimbursement laws and regulatory requirements anti-remuneration laws the Stark Law and/or federal and state false claims laws.



In the third quarter the reimbursement pressure within the pharmacy business continued despite experiencing certain stabilization. The company is making continued efforts to combat this reimbursement pressure by increasing volume and reducing costs.

Like preceding CVEs it concerns the session authentication between Bluetooth devices where the attacker uses spoofed paired or bonded devices to force the use of a much shorter encryption key length.

The name of this newly discovered vulnerability is BLUFFS (Bluetooth Forward and Future Secrecy) where forward and future secrecy are important terms that refer to the protection of secure sessions against compromise in the past (forward FoS) and future (FuS). The CVE presentation notes that the Bluetooth specification does not cover either FuS or FoS. In total two new architectural vulnerabilities were discovered both of which attack the security key.

The Bluetooth SIG has released a statement regarding this attack method. Although serious it would seem that the core issue is that some implementations allow for encryption key lengths below 7 octets:

A childhood diagnosis of type 1 diabetes is a huge shock for any family. But when The Overtones singer Jay James and wife Victoria Picton discovered their son Franklin four had the condition they didn’t realise they had been “incredibly lucky”.

Many type 1 diabetics are only diagnosed after suffering side effects including blurred vision tiredness and weight loss and even diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) a potentially life-threatening condition. DKA is caused by an increase in ketones a chemical produced in the liver to burn fat when insulin is low which makes blood become acidic.

But Franklin’s type 1 was discovered by chance. In August 2022 when he was three mum Vicky found him holding a bottle of Calpol. “He’d somehow managed to get the cap off” remembers Jay 40. “There was still loads in the bottle and he didn’t seem to have had any but Vicky phoned 111. They said it was almost certainly OK but if it would put her mind at rest take him to A&E.”

At hospital doctors seemed relaxed but offered a blood test for reassurance. But when they returned says Jay “the mood had completely changed”. “They told us Franklin’s blood sugar levels were really high and he needed to go immediately to the children’s hospital. We thought it was to do with paracetamol but they explained it had nothing to do with it and high blood sugar could indicate diabetes.

“They couldn’t even let him have a drink of water. He was blue-lighted to the children’s hospital with me following behind.”

The roller-coaster ride continued when bloods taken at the children’s hospital indicated Franklin’s levels had stabilised. “A nurse wondered if he’d had sugar on his fingers for the original test until we explained blood had been taken via a cannula. Then it all got very serious again – meanwhile Franklin was popping about the place really happy in himself and Vicky and I just had this horrible feeling of not knowing what was going on.”

After an overnight stay and more tests a specialist came to Franklin’s bedside. “She started talking about what needed to happen next we didn’t understand any of it. She said ‘Has no one told you? Your son is type 1 diabetic’.”

Jay and Vicky were in shock. “Now I’ve learned about it I know we were incredibly lucky to catch it so early. Because of this little accident Franklin didn’t go into diabetic ­ketoacidosis. But at that moment it was just horrendous.”

What followed felt like “a week-long university degree in type 1 diabetes – how to keep our child alive. Restraining him to give him daily injections which he absolutely hated” he says.

Jay has come to understand type 1 as “a lifelong chronic currently incurable autoimmune condition that requires insulin to be injected into your body on a daily basis and monitored minute by minute. If it’s not the consequences could be fatal.”

In the 15 months since diagnosis the family has learned how to keep his condition in check. He’s been able to use a “brilliant” Dexcom continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and an insulin pump – but there have been setbacks.

“Our management of Franklin’s diabetes has intensified lately because he’s having an adverse reaction to the adhesives used with the technology and started to rip it all off so we’ve had to go back to injections. Any parent knows how intense it is to take your baby for immunisations just imagine that 10 times a day. Then there’s the finger pricks – on a bad day there could be 25 30 of those.”

At night says Jay he Vicky and Franklin are up so often it’s like having a newborn. Currently on tour with The Overtones Jay finds it tough leaving Vicky to look after Franklin and big sister Nova 10 alone.

“I’m trying to get home as much as I can as it’s relentless for Vicky. The other night I got home at 2.30am Franklin had two lows then a high then I was up giving him a correction.”

Mealtimes are also a challenge. Preparing food for a preschooler can be tricky and says Jay catering for a child with type 1 is next level. “We carb count everything that’s going into his mouth check his blood sugar calculate how much insulin he’ll need and administer it 15 minutes before he eats. As you’d imagine you do all this planning give him the food and he says ‘No’.

“It’s a ticking time bomb because you know once the insulin’s taken hold there’ll be a low any minute. If they don’t eat all the food the calculation’s off.

“Franklin is quite symptomatic and around meal times his levels can be high dropping from low to high or just low so he can get really ­emotional and not eat. But it took a while to understand it as the readings weren’t always accurate so we’d be really anxious imploring him to eat.

“Eventually you realise because you’re panicking you’ve kind of been telling your child off for something they are incapable of understanding which is just awful. There’s no education you find these things out for yourself. It’s so difficult.”

It was this steep learning curve that inspired Jay to set up My Diabetes Story a platform where people with type 1 and their loved ones can share their experiences. “We’ve talked to so many people living with type 1 and discovered this pool of empathy and support. I knew nothing about the condition I was really naive. We’ve found being able to get peer support is so important.”

The Overtones will also be making donations to two diabetes charities JDRF and Diabetes UK from the proceeds of their Christmas single Christmas Everyday. “One of the biggest things I’ve found as a carer and parent of a child with type 1 is the psychological effects the grief” explains Jay.

“In a moment you go from having this happy healthy little child who’s running around can eat ice creams do whatever they want to realising life isn’t going to be like that. This little thing is going to have to make 300 more decisions a day than anyone else to stay happy and healthy.

“Even a year on it still makes us emotional thinking about the weight that’s on his shoulders. I wish I could take it from him and do it myself. Thankfully children see life instantly. One minute it can be the end of the world and the next minute they’re on top of the world. There are already unbelievable technological developments and we have to hope we can find a cure.”

Those tactics are sure to make Dunn a potent force in the 2024 election pulling candidates to the right in races up and down the ballot in the second-most populous U.S. state. His dollars could also shape the presidential contest: He has backed GOP frontrunner Donald Trump before contributing $300000 to his 2020 reelection effort. He has not donated this cycle to Trump or any other presidential candidate.

It’s not certain that Dunn would use proceeds from an acquisition to ratchet up his political donations. Officials at his company declined to comment about its potential sale. But close observers of Texas politics say they expect his giving could increase if he sells his company.

Wherever Dunn decides to flex his political muscle he’ll have the help of former Trump digital strategist Brad Parscale who has relocated to the West Texas desert and is consulting for an advertising company that a Securities and Exchange Commission filing shows Dunn has financed.

Since 2011 Dunn has made political donations to candidates and committees at the federal level and in Texas totaling $31.9 million. He was the nation’s 65th-largest donor to super political action committees in the 2022 election cycle according to OpenSecrets.

Power broker. A wave of consolidation in the shale industry could soon make Dunn an even more formidable power broker: The likes of Occidental Petroleum Corp. Devon Energy Corp. and Diamondback Energy have eyed closely held CrownRock as an acquisition target according to people familiar with the situation who were not authorized to discuss the matter because the bidding process is private.

A sale would score its owners — which include Dunn and private equity firm Lime Rock Partners — a massive payout. It could also have lasting implications for Texas’s political landscape.

“If he pulls this off he can seriously change politics for the next 10 years” said Republican donor Bryan Sheffield a prominent figure in the Texas oil industry and billionaire founder of Parsley Energy who regularly donates to Republican candidates.

Dunn 67 who delivers sermons at an evangelical church in his hometown of Midland Texas and founded a private Christian school stands apart from other big Texas GOP donors – including pipeline magnate Kelcy Warren and real estate mogul Harlan Crow — because the interests of his industry don’t appear to be the primary driver of his giving.

“It’s been much more with an ideological and policy agenda” for Dunn said Mark Jones a political science professor at Rice University in Houston.

Lasting Franchise . Dunn grew up just outside Midland in Big Spring Texas on a flat expanse of the Chihuahuan Desert. His father was a farmer who never graduated high school. Dunn became an Eagle Scout played guitar in a rock band and married his wife after their junior year at Texas Tech.

In an October address from his church’s pulpit Dunn warned the congregation against being overly focused on immediate gratification.

“The best investments take time” he said.

Dunn certainly has shown patience in building his own business empire. It has taken more than a decade to grow CrownRock into one of the Permian basin’s most-prized assets.

Through Dunn’s other company – CrownQuest Operating LLC which manages the assets of CrownRock – production has climbed by 15% through the first six months of this year according to industry data provider Enverus. That’s on top of last year’s 21% output growth and the 36% expansion in 2020 according to CrownQuest.

With core inventory spread across 94000 net acres CrownQuest is tied with Double Eagle Energy Holdings IV LLC as the second-most active private driller with five rigs working in the Midland basin of the Permian.

“He’s built a lasting franchise” said Steve Pruett a Midland oil explorer who has known Dunn for roughly three decades.

Indeed five of his six children work in the oil sector. (The one who isn’t in the business David Dunn is a Christian singer-songwriter. The father and son jam together sometimes with the elder picking the guitar or mandolin.)

More than a decade after the shale revolution upended global energy markets some companies have exhausted their most prolific rocks and are moving to scoop up quality replacements. That’s what Exxon Mobil Corp. did this fall when it agreed to purchase Pioneer Natural Resources the Permian’s biggest independent producer for $60 billion.

Against that backdrop Dunn is weighing a sale of CrownRock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAxL29jY2lkZW50YWwtcGV0cm9sZXVtLWNvdWxkLXNvb24tZm9sbG93LWV4eG9uLWFuZC1jL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Occidental Petroleum Could Soon Follow Exxon and Chevron by Making a Needle-Moving Acquisition,"Occidental Petroleum could make a needle-moving deal.

Occidental Petroleum (OXY 0.12%) could be nearing a deal to buy privately held oil producer CrownRock. The Wall Street Journal reported that the oil giant was in the lead to buy the Permian Basin producer. The deal could be worth more than $10 billion.

The potential deal would be the latest in a wave of merger activity in the oil patch. ExxonMobil (XOM -0.07%) and Chevron (CVX -0.48%) closed multibillion-dollar acquisitions this year and have since agreed to even larger transactions. That's spurring rivals to consider deals of their own to keep up with those energy giants.

In the lead to buy a prized producer

Occidental is one of several oil companies linked to CrownRock in recent weeks. Reuters reported last month that ConocoPhillips was weighing an offer for CrownRock. Meanwhile Devon Energy Diamondback Energy Marathon Oil and Continental Resources have all looked into buying CrownRock. Given the intense interest talks with Occidental might not lead to a deal if one of those rivals or another suitor swoops in at the last moment.

The big draw with CrownRock is its sizable position in the Permian Basin. The company owns more than 80000 acres in the northern part of the Midland Basin. It currently produces about 150000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (BOE/d) from that position. Buying CrownRock would enable the acquirer to meaningfully increase their scale in the resource-rich Permian. That would allow them to spread costs over a larger position increasing their profit margin.

Occidental is already one of the largest players in the Permian. The company holds 2.8 million acres. Overall it produces 588000 BOE/d from its position in the Permian. Acquiring CrownRock would enable Occidental to further increase its scale in the region and leverage its existing position to reduce costs.

Getting bigger and better

Scale has been the main driver of the current wave of mergers in the oil patch. Exxon is paying over $60 billion to acquire Pioneer Natural Resources to boost its scale in the Permian. The deal will more than double Exxon's acreage position in the region (adding 850000 net acres to its existing 570000 net-acre position). It will also more than double its Permian production to a combined 1.3 million BOE/d. Exxon believes its enhanced scale will enable it to earn double-digit returns as it recovers more resources more efficiently.

Scale also drove Chevron's $7.6 billion deal for PDC Energy. It significantly enhanced Chevron's position in the DJ Basin where it added 275000 net acres. Meanwhile it added 25000 acres to its position in the Permian. That increased scale drives Chevron's expectation it will capture about $100 million in cost savings while adding about $1 billion in annual free cash flow. Meanwhile the company's $60 billion deal for Hess should enable it to capture around $1 billion in cost savings.

An acquisition of CrownRock could enable its acquirer to achieve meaningful cost savings by streamlining development plans leveraging existing infrastructure and spreading costs over a larger position. That's why so many oil companies are interested in CrownRock.

Only one oil company will emerge victorious in the bidding for CrownRock. That will likely lead its other suitors to look elsewhere for a needle-moving deal. Some could seek to join forces -- Devon and Marathon have reportedly held merger talks -- while others will likely look at another private producer potentially circling back to see if Endeavor Energy Resources is now ready to sell.

The next wave is about to hit

Occidental Petroleum is reportedly in the lead to acquire CrownRock. A potential tie-up between the two would enhance Occidental's already strong position in the Permian further increasing its scale. The conclusion of that auction process would likely lead other suitors to look elsewhere for a deal so that they don't lose out on the opportunity to participate in what's becoming a major consolidation wave in the sector.",,,,,,

Here's Why,"You can get all the upside of AI without taking on too much risk.

If there's one trend that defined 2023 and could define the entire decade it's artificial intelligence (AI). Practically every company is spending on ways to build and implement AI into their products. And while any business stands to benefit from the advancements being made in AI some stand to benefit more than others.

Nvidia for example is riding a massive wave of demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) which many developers use to train their AI models. But you don't have to pick the next Nvidia to capitalize on the rapid growth in AI. In fact you may be better off not doing so.

Picking a winner in an area with such wide-ranging technology and many competing forces is no easy task. And if a company's future relies on them outmaneuvering everyone else when it comes to facilitating AI you could be looking at an all-or-nothing investment. Here's what to do instead.

Build a basket of smart AI investments

If you invest in a wide-ranging basket of stocks all with plenty of upside potential from advancements in AI you're sure to have a few winners. You'll also have a few losers but if you believe AI is a transformational technology that could generate trillions in economic value the winners will surely outweigh the losers.

You can take some big risks if you size them right. Don't put too much into a single company with a make-or-break AI product. Even if they have promising technology another company could come along tomorrow with an innovation that blows them out of the water.

Companies that stand to benefit if their technology is used to advance AI but aren't reliant on any single company or product can serve as a great core to your AI basket of stocks. These are the companies offering platforms and services that provide the backbone of advancements in AI. What's more their businesses won't be brought to their knees if a new AI technology doesn't work out in their favor.

Instead of the chipmaker building the next AI chip that could end up in an enterprise's data center invest in the data centers or the chip foundry. Take a look at Digital Realty or Taiwan Semiconductor. Or look at the major public cloud providers: Microsoft Amazon and Alphabet's Google.

Consider companies advancing AI that have asymmetrical upside with limited downside. Meta Platforms for example is one of the biggest AI innovators. It could one day provide the underlying technology for many AI products. In the meantime it's using its AI innovations to drive real revenue results for its shareholders by incorporating its technology throughout its products. Having a built-in customer (itself) for AI products and spending puts it in a much stronger position to innovate.

You don't have to build the basket yourself

If you don't want to build a basket of stocks yourself several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focus specifically on AI and robotics. One of the newest entries with a bigger focus on AI is the WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Fund (WTAI 1.29%).

The fund invests in companies offering AI technologies or contributing to the development and deployment of AI innovations. It'll give you exposure to the AI megatrend for a small fee of just 0.45% of assets -- its expense ratio. Some of its most recent top holdings include:

Naver: The Korean conglomerate that operates its eponymous search engine popular messaging/social media app Line and its cloud computing service.

It's also a leading PC operating system and enterprise software developer (in case you forgot). Arm Holdings: The company advancing chip architecture used by leading chip designers. Everyone from Nvidia to the big tech companies uses Arm's architecture for their AI chip designs.

There are about 75 additional holdings in the portfolio none of which are weighted much more heavily than about 2%.

Maintain a long-term outlook on AI

It's easy to chase the most recent AI winners but building a portfolio of companies that stand to benefit from advancement in AI (both from their own innovations and others) is one of the best ways to ensure you get a lot of the upside while limiting your downside. Many AI stocks have astronomical valuations making them precarious investments these days. One earnings miss one product delay or one new competitor could wipe out the stock.

If you focus on companies with real competitive advantages building products and services to support the growth of AI taking advantage of their own innovations or both you'll have a strong portfolio built for the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZGFpbHktbWFya2V0cy1tYXJrZXRzLXNlZS1zdHJlbmd0aC1jb21pbmctaW50by1kZWNlbWJlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Daily Markets: Markets See Strength Coming Into December,"Today’s Big Picture

Asia-Pacific equity markets finished the day mostly down or flat except for India’s SENSEX which closed 0.74% higher. Taiwan’s TAIEX (0.03%) and China’s Shanghai Composite (0.06%) ended the day essentially flat. Both Japan’s Nikkei and Australia’s ASX All Ordinaries declined 0.17% South Korea’s KOSPI fell 1.19% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng gave back 1.25% in a broad decline led by Non-Energy Materials and Consumer Durables. European markets are ahead in midday trading and U.S. equity futures point to a mixed open as Nasdaq 100 name Tesla (TSLA) is coming under pressure this morning.

Markets are becoming increasingly comfortable with the idea that not only has the Fed stopped raising rates but that expectations are that we should be seeing our first rate cut a lot earlier than the June forecast from a week or so ago and the Fall estimate from a month or so ago. Fed Fund futures are currently pricing in no change in both the December and January meetings and while not an overwhelming position are pricing in a 45% chance of a cut in March compared to 11% at the end of October. Given recent bond market moves yesterday’s positive inflation update and consistent messaging by the Fed markets closed out November on an upbeat note and this sentiment is expected to carry through December.

NTT Global Data Centers in November paid $27.5 million for the buildings at 1200 and 1250 N. Arlington Heights Road in Itasca Illinois according to DuPage County property records.

It’s the latest example of developers zeroing in on vacant or lightly used offices to convert them to other uses amid historically low usage of office space throughout the country.

Many of those have been conversions to warehouses but data center companies also have been getting into the act as recently seen farther northwest in Chicago’s suburbs. In Hoffman Estates Illinois Compass Datacenters in September paid $194 million for the sprawling former Sears headquarters which the Dallas-based developer is expected to demolish to make way for newly constructed high-tech data storage space.

The deal by NTT Global Data Centers creates room for future phases of data center construction within Hamilton Lakes a sprawling campus with office buildings hotels and other buildings developed in recent decades by local firm Hamilton Partners.

NTT Global Data Centers is one of the nation's largest developers in the high-demand property sector. It is part of Tokyo-based telecom giant NTT. The firm declined to comment to CoStar News about its plans for the newest site in Itasca which is more than 12 acres.

But the firm already has one data center on a nearby site that it bought from Hamilton Partners and it’s in the process of adding a second one there. That site is part of more than $64 million that NTT has now paid to Hamilton Partners for more than 46 acres in a series of deals between 2017 and late this year according to county records and CoStar data.

“We have a good relationship with them and it’s working out well for the park” Patrick McKillen a partner at the local development firm told CoStar News.

“From our standpoint we’re probably not going to develop another office building for a while” he said. “It’s a good fit.”

Unlike other uses such as distribution centers data centers create little traffic or noise McKillen said. The latest sale unlike previous land deals with NTT will remove vacant office space from the complex.

The five-story building at 1250 N. Arlington Heights Road is vacant and the four-story structure at 1200 N. Arlington Heights Road is less than 40% leased McKillen said.

“We have the opportunity to reposition some of those tenants in other buildings at Hamilton Lakes” when NTT eventually demolishes the buildings for later phases of its data center campus McKillen said.

Data centers are essentially warehouses filled with servers and other gear that can be used to help power Americans’ ever-growing use of streaming services online shopping and storage of personal data such as photos. Major users of data storage include Amazon Google Netflix and Facebook parent Meta.

Chicago is one of the largest data center markets in the country. The largest is in Northern Virginia.

Itasca and neighboring suburbs particularly Elk Grove Village have emerged as a hot spot for data storage. The Chicago area is favored by data center owners because of access to power fiber optic lines state and local tax breaks and the area’s relatively low risk of natural disasters.

Ongoing developments near O’Hare include a $1 billion project launched about a year ago by Prime Data Centers in Elk Grove Village.

There have been several bull and bear markets over the past 25 years and the bulls may be making another run. While high-flying growth stocks tend to attract more attention don't overlook strong dividend payers that can also be a valuable addition to your portfolio providing steady income along with long-term growth.

Among their number are real estate investment trusts (REITs) owners of income-producing property who by dint of their tax status are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income each year to shareholders.

Three good choices to consider are American Tower (AMT 0.52%) Prologis (PLD 1.55%) and Realty Income (O 0.31%). While in very different businesses each stand to be excellent long-term investments due to their consistent dividend payouts strong balance sheets and resilience to economic fluctuations.

The chart below shows the total return for all three REITs since American Tower went public in 1998 (Realty Income did so in 1994 and Prologis in 1991). Despite the relatively conservative nature of real estate investing all three of these companies have handily outperformed the S&P 500 over the past quarter century.

Let's take a look at each.

1. American Tower

American Tower holds a dominant position in global digital infrastructure growing its network of towers and more recently data centers and small cell antennas to about 225000 sites in 25 different countries.

The major mobile carriers dominate this infrastructure REIT's tenant list but thousands more customers also provide a steady cash flow with the sector's demand expected to be on the rise for years to come.

American Tower stock has jumped about 18% in the past month and now trades for about $201 per share but analysts give it a consensus target price of $228.60 pointing to room to grow. The current yield is about $3.2% and 12 straight years of dividend increases show the payout just might keep growing too.





2. Prologis

Prologis is the 1.2 billion-square-foot gorilla of warehouse space providing business-to-business and retail/online fulfillment space to about 6700 customers in 19 countries.

This industrial REIT's vast client list is anchored by reliable rent-payers like FedEx and Amazon and the demand for logistics infrastructure that exploded over the past decade should continue to keep its space and coffers full.



Prologis stock jumped about 14% in November and now trades at about $110 a share good for a yield of about 3.2%. Analysts give it a consensus target price of $139 a very nice potential upside to go along with 10 straight years of dividend increases including by an annualized 14% over the past three years.





3. Realty Income

Realty Income is the largest and perhaps best known of retail REITs and a poster child for dividend stocks with a record of 640 monthly dividends and 31 consecutive years of annual increases.

Realty Income now owns about 13000 rent-producing properties anchored by brand-name retailers. Industrial properties and casinos add to the mix and Realty Income just announced plans for the $9.3 billion acquisition of Spirit Realty Capital and its more than 2100 retail and industrial properties.



Realty Income stock has jumped about 11% in the past month but is still yielding a nice 5.7% at a share price of about $54 that analysts give a consensus target price of $60.90.





Ready to return to steady growth

These REITs are the biggest of their kind and are priced nicely for continued turnarounds from the year-over-year battering shown in the chart above.

With strong track records economic moats and exposure to secular demand trends they have promising long-term prospects -- with steady dividends along the way. For investors taking a buy-and-hold approach these three REITs warrant serious consideration.",,,

What happened?

Scientists believe the whale which beached in Kauai died from ingesting fishing traps and nets plastic bags and other marine debris. The 56-foot 120000-pound marine mammal had foreign objects at the opening of its intestinal tract that prevented it from digesting its food.

“This is the first sperm whale in Hawaiian waters where we have seen this kind of ingestion of discarded fishing gear and nets” Kristi West the director of the University of Hawaii’s Health and Stranding Lab said in a press release. “It’s heartbreaking to see this kind of destruction in an individual animal.”

After examining the whale’s stomach scientists found six hagfish traps seven varieties of fishing nets two kinds of plastic bags and multiple fishing lines. The whale’s stomach was so big that researchers were unable to study its entirety and believe there were more items they could not recover.

Why is this whale death concerning?

The whale death is a jarring reminder of how dangerous plastic pollution is to marine life. Even creatures as large as sperm whales can fall victim to plastic debris in the ocean.

Researchers estimate there are 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic waste in the ocean. Roughly 269000 tons of this waste floats on the ocean surface and about four billion plastic microfibers per square kilometer pollute the deep sea.

Not only does this pose a risk to marine life that mistake these items for food but it can also contaminate human food. Toxins from plastic pollution contaminate fish and humans are exposed to these toxins when eating seafood.

What can I do to help protect marine life?

Plastic waste is endangering marine species and it is our responsibility to reduce ocean pollution. Luckily there are a variety of solutions everyone can participate in.

The simplest way to fight plastic pollution is to reduce our reliance on single-use plastics. There are many reusable products that you can introduce to your daily life to replace these items.

When you go shopping bring reusable grocery bags and instead of using plastic water bottles try carrying around a reusable one.

Participating in beach or river cleanups or donating to organizations that conduct them like 4ocean or The Ocean Cleanup is the most direct way to prevent ocean plastic pollution. Clearing trash from coastlines not only saves the ocean from plastic debris but you may also save a life.

Risks of Investing in the Industry,"Fintech stocks are typically high-growth companies that are investing heavily in disruptive technologies and as a whole they aren't the safest places to put your money. That said just as with any other sector or subsector of the stock market there is a wide range of risk when it comes to fintech stocks. And even for those that would be considered risky the long-term return potential can certainly justify the risks. Some fintech stocks are among the most rock-solid companies in the world and could be considered very safe stocks while others are high-growth stocks with tremendous return potential but also with a lot that could go wrong. With that in mind here's a rundown of some of the key factors to consider from a safety perspective when evaluating fintech stocks for your portfolio.

Image source: Getty Images.

Sales growth Sales growth One thing I look for in every fintech stock I consider is how fast it's growing revenue (or sales). It's important not only to look for excellent growth in the current quarter or fiscal year but also to look for an established and consistent track record of growth. In addition it's important to be sure there's plenty of room for the growth rate to be sustained. As an example if a company has $1 billion in annual sales and grew its revenue by 30% last year I'd be more excited if the overall market size were $50 billion than I would if it were $3 billion. Balance sheet and profitability Balance sheet and profitability Does the company you're studying have a substantial debt burden on its balance sheet or is it cash-rich? A rock-solid balance sheet with more cash than debt can significantly reduce the risk involved with an investment -- even more so if the company is profitable. In the fintech industry there are many companies that aren't yet profitable. And that's OK provided that they're growing and have a clear path to profitability. For example Square (SQ 2.27%) isn't consistently profitable yet but with the stock recently soaring to all-time highs nobody seems to care. Why? Square is expanding its business so rapidly quarter after quarter that investors are perfectly happy with the company's decision to reinvest aggressively in its business. Consistent profitability certainly adds to the safety of a stock. This is why I'd put a consistently profitable company such as American Express (AXP 0.81%) in a lower risk tier than Square. Competition Competition Is the fintech company you're considering the leader in its business or does it compete with larger players? Is the industry large and fragmented or do just a few companies dominate the market? Competitive risk is one of the main factors affecting the safety of any stock including fintechs. As an example consider Visa (V -1.63%) and Mastercard (MA -1.14%). They aren't just the leaders in payment processing the two of them dominate the space. On the other hand newly public insurance tech company Lemonade (LMND 1.48%) participates in a highly competitive industry with lots of much larger players.

Competitive advantages Competitive advantages On a similar note a durable competitive advantage (or several) can help level the playing field between large established companies and small disruptive fintechs. Competitive advantages come in several forms. Maybe a company has pricing power over its rivals or a brand name that is widely trusted and helps sell its product. As an example of the latter consider how PayPal (PYPL 0.83%) has become nearly synonymous with ""online payments."" This creates a huge barrier for would-be competitors. In the fintech space common competitive advantages also include such things as proprietary technology patents and other intellectual property. I mentioned insurance tech company Lemonade in the previous section; although it's small and in a crowded industry the company has an artificial intelligence quote platform superior to what's currently on the market. Cyclicality Cyclicality Cyclicality refers to how sensitive an industry or business is to recessions and other economic fluctuations. As an example a hotel is a cyclical business since fewer people travel when times are tough. On the other hand healthcare is not a cyclical business because people need access to healthcare services no matter what the economy is doing. Some fintech companies are quite cyclical. For example not only do credit card issuers such as American Express and Discover Financial Services (DFS 0.21%) rely on the ability and willingness of consumers and businesses to spend money but during recessions more people tend to have trouble paying their bills. On the other hand payment processors such as Visa and Mastercard are somewhat less cyclical because while they rely on fee income from spending they are not lenders and don't have as much default risk.

The network effect The network effect What is the No. 1 reason people join social media sites such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR)? It's because other people they are interested in are already on the platform. This is a basic explanation of a phenomenon known as the network effect and this also applies to some fintech stocks. As an example Square's Cash App allows users to seamlessly send and receive money from people they know. As more people sign up for the Cash App over time the platform becomes even more attractive to those not already on it. In other words Cash App is a much more useful platform now that it has 30 million active users than it was with 7 million users at the end of 2017. Many people couldn't bear the thought of deleting their Facebook page and the same can be said for their Cash App and Venmo accounts. This effect provides a competitive advantage that adds to the safety of the companies that operate these platforms. The bottom line on fintech stock risk When investing in stocks regardless of the sector or subsector of the market it wouldn't be fair to label all fintech stocks as either safe or risky. This is especially true in the fintech space where companies cover such a broad range of business models and you should therefore evaluate each stock's relative safety level individually using the criteria discussed here.

The Van Buren County Sheriff's Office was made aware that a 21-year-old of Kalamazoo would be delivering five ounces of meth to the Dollar General in Lawrence.

Detectives later saw the man with a 33-year-old woman walking into the store according to the sheriff's office.

Calhoun County:

When questioned by detectives they denied involvement. However K9 Kuno indicated that drugs were present deputies said.

The female was arrested for misdemeanor traffic violations when she told detectives that the man she was with threw her a large bag of meth and told her to ""crotch it"" the sheriff's office reported.

She stuffed it in her underwear and was asked to remove it.

Bank scheme:

Both individuals were taken to the Van Buren County Jail.

The man was out on parole for delivery of methamphetamine the sheriff's office said.

After our previous stories the owner of Green City Foods has been very vocal on social media about how it would hurt their business.

""In a small community all the businesses we kind of work off one another work together and a big corporation is not going to do that"" said Chelsea Rouse owner of Green City Foods.



That is the primary reason why Rouse is against a potential .

Rouse and Green City Foods Manager Laurie Leslie also discussed with us if they would be able to adjust their costs if Dollar General comes to town.

Their answer was not optimistic.

""It definitely would impact the store"" Leslie said. ""There's just not enough population here to sustain two businesses like that. We sell some of the same products. The only other product that we would have different than them would be the produce and the meat. We're more of a convenience in a small town. They're going to come in and get a bag of chips and a pop. There's no way it would sustain both of our businesses. Of course they can beat us on pricing. And then we would lose our grocery store.""



""Just not enough attraction in this town that draws people to town"" Rouse said. ""I don't foresee anything we could do to kind of compete and keep open the businesses here. We would have to close.""



It should be noted that Dollar General's Public Relations team has informed KTVO that they are still in the due diligence phase of potentially opening a store in Green City.

Nothing has been finalized but we are expecting to hear a decision this winter.

If the store comes to Green City it would be located near the Highway 129 and Highway 6 Junction.

We have reached out to city officials to get their reaction on this topic and are hoping to speak to them soon.

The Fort Myers Florida-based Zeroed-In is a data and technology consultancy that provides workforce analytical services to its clients.

Dollar Tree which operates roughly 16000 eponymous and Family Dollar outlets in North America was struck in a manner reminiscent of the massive 2020 Russian-backed cyber hit on SolarWinds.

So far there is no word on who attacked Dollar Tree through Zeroed-In nor if a ransom demand or data extortion threat has been posted.

Names Birth Dates and Social Security Numbers Stolen

The cyber operation reportedly occurred on August 7-8 2023. Information stolen during the attack includes names birth dates and social security numbers. Zeroed-In said it has not yet been able to identify all of the specific files that were accessed or taken by the attacker.

In a breach notification filing with the Maine Attorney General’s Office (some 7000 Maine residents were potentially affected) the company revealed that the incident was identified on August 8 and that a threat actor had unauthorized access to certain systems between August 7-8.

“While the investigation was able to determine that these systems were accessed it was not able to confirm all of the specific files that were accessed or taken by the unauthorized actor"" the letter reads.

""Therefore Zeroed-In conducted a review of the contents of the systems to determine what information was present at the time of the incident to whom the information relates and to which Zeroed-In customers the information belonged. This review was completed on August 31 2023 and Zeroed-In notified [Dollar Tree] of the event because certain individuals associated with them were identified during the review.”

The company has notified the affected individuals with instructions on enrolling in a 12-month identity protection and credit monitoring service.

It’s not clear if other Zeroed-In customers in addition to Dollar Tree and Family Dollar have been impacted by the security breach.

Security Experts Comment on Breach

Security experts weighed in on the breach pointing out the cyber danger of supply chain attacks.

Etay Maor Cato Networks senior director of security strategy at Cato Networks said that supply chain attacks exploit the assumed trust between organizations.

""On one hand organizations are forced to work closely with third-party providers to be competitive while on the other hand if these third parties are not secure which is out of their control it inherently puts organizations at risk and challenges their ability to remain secure"" Etay said. ""Determined cyberattackers will keep probing an organization’s defenses until they find the weakest chain in the supply chain which in some cases may be your service provider.""

Lior Yaari chief executive and founder of Grip Security said that the ""reliance on SaaS services"" shows the unanticipated risk companies face.

""Dollar Tree may have done everything perfectly but if one of their SaaS vendors has shortcomings in their security it puts Dollar Tree at risk"" Yaari said. ""Their vendor likely had all the required certifications yet they experienced a breach that affected millions of customers. There is a fundamental flaw that needs to be addressed or this will continue to happen and more companies will be impacted.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN1cGVybWFya2V0bmV3cy5jb20vcmV0YWlsLWZpbmFuY2lhbC9kb2xsYXItdHJlZS1lbXBsb3llZXMtYWZmZWN0ZWQtdGhpcmQtcGFydHktZGF0YS1icmVhY2gtaW1wYWN0aW5nLTJt0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dollar Tree employees affected by third-party data breach impacting 2M,"Dollar Tree employee information has been compromised by a cyberattack which ultimately affected the data of close to 2 million people according to a data breach notification shared with the Maine Attorney General.

Zeroed-In Technologies recently sent out a letter to impacted customers informing them of the data breach which occurred on Aug. 8. Dollar Tree’s service provider Zeroed-In Technologies said it immediately took steps to secure the systems and has launched an investigation into the nature and scope of the activity.

Information stolen during the attack includes names dates of birth and Social Security numbers of Dollar Tree employees.

While Zeroed-In was able to determine that certain systems were accessed it was not able to confirm all of the specific files that were accessed or taken. Therefore the company conducted a review of the contents of the systems to determine what information was present at the time of the incident and to whom the information related to.

In the letter Zeroed-In said it was reviewing its existing policies and procedures and had implemented additional safeguards to prevent a similar event from happening in the future.

Zeroed-In has also offered impacted clients access to a free credit monitoring service that will provide alerts for 12 months from the date of enrollment when changes happen to credit files. The company is also providing proactive fraud assistance and remediation services.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzYXJndXMuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvY2FzaGllci1jdXN0b21lci1jaGFyZ2VkLWluLWRvbGxhci10cmVlLXNob290aW5nL2FydGljbGVfZWI1YmFlNmEtNGQzZS01MjNmLThlYmQtZjgzM2VlMjk5N2U2Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cashier customer charged in Dollar Tree shooting | Local News | newsargus.com,We have used your information to see if you have a subscription with us but did not find one.

CONCORD NH — A woman who had been missing since Thursday was found dead inside a vehicle on the Concord Heights on Friday.

Around 9:30 a.m. a caller reported to police that a family member had been missing since Thursday. Dispatch said the woman never returned home after running an errand and did not report to work Friday morning. The caller said the woman had been sick during the past few days. The information was given to an officer. Dispatch also called Concord Hospital and the woman was not there.

At a little past 10:30 a.m. a family member found the woman dead inside a parked vehicle outside of the Dollar Tree on Loudon Road. Concord fire and rescue teams were requested to confirm the woman was dead.

Officers and a detective were seen standing by outside of the vehicle for several hours.

(NYSE:D) EPS Numbers,"Market forces rained on the parade of Dominion Energy Inc. (NYSE:D) shareholders today when the analysts downgraded their forecasts for next year. Both revenue and earnings per share (EPS) forecasts went under the knife suggesting the analysts have soured majorly on the business.

Following the downgrade the consensus from eight analysts covering Dominion Energy is for revenues of US$15b in 2024 implying an uncomfortable 17% decline in sales compared to the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are expected to be US$2.94 roughly flat on the last 12 months. Prior to this update the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$19b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.34 in 2024. Indeed we can see that the analysts are a lot more bearish about Dominion Energy's prospects administering a pretty serious reduction to revenue estimates and slashing their EPS estimates to boot.

See our latest analysis for Dominion Energy

Analysts made no major changes to their price target of US$48.64 suggesting the downgrades are not expected to have a long-term impact on Dominion Energy's valuation.

Of course another way to look at these forecasts is to place them into context against the industry itself. We would highlight that sales are expected to reverse with a forecast 14% annualised revenue decline to the end of 2024. That is a notable change from historical growth of 5.7% over the last five years. Compare this with our data which suggests that other companies in the same industry are in aggregate expected to see their revenue grow 2.6% per year. It's pretty clear that Dominion Energy's revenues are expected to perform substantially worse than the wider industry.

The Bottom Line

The biggest issue in the new estimates is that analysts have reduced their earnings per share estimates suggesting business headwinds lay ahead for Dominion Energy. Unfortunately analysts also downgraded their revenue estimates and industry data suggests that Dominion Energy's revenues are expected to grow slower than the wider market. We're also surprised to see that the price target went unchanged. Still deteriorating business conditions (assuming accurate forecasts!) can be a leading indicator for the stock price so we wouldn't blame investors for being more cautious on Dominion Energy after the downgrade.

Even so the longer term trajectory of the business is much more important for the value creation of shareholders. At Simply Wall St we have a full range of analyst estimates for Dominion Energy going out to 2025 and you can see them free on our platform here.

The Science Museum/DMV HQ is great because you always if possible want to watch from the beginning of the parade. All the elements are fresh and are at their best. Even though it may be crowded the energy is high and the people are great.

Also between Lowe’s (on North Allen Street and Broad Street) and the Siegel Center (on North Harrison Street and Broad Street) is a great straight stretch to watch the parade. With the amount of available parking and access to both South Richmond and I-195 this is a great place to watch the parade and get out quickly thereafter.

What does 2024 have in store? In Design Psychic our community of editors experts and tastemakers predicts the trends coming soon to a house near you.

We smell something burning in the kitchen—and it’s not cookies. It’s the good kind of fiery: red kitchen cabinets.

Every year we poll interior designers to find out what kitchen cabinet color they think will be the next big thing. Because whether you want to admit it or not paint trends cycle through kitchens fast. Only five or so years ago white cabinets were all the rage. Then navy blue and sage green had us feeling some type of way. Looking ahead to 2024 most of the designers we spoke with agreed that the warmer side of the color spectrum is leading the way with shades of red kicking us off. Here’s what they had to say when we asked them: What’s the next It kitchen cabinet color?

Red

Courtesy of DeVol | The Real Shaker Kitchen by DeVol prices start at $20000.

For those who are a little nervous to experiment with color I think we’ll see it being used in a more historical context (i.e. Victorian shades of yellow and blue). And damn I’m waiting for a really good red kitchen. —Sally Breer Sally Breer World

Earthy reds of course. —Zoe Feldman

We’re really excited to be experimenting with more specialty finishes such as burl burnished stainless oxidized copper and oiled walnut. As for paint choices we recently painted the interiors of our kitchen vermilion. I’m very into red! —Britt Zunino Studio DB

Deep Reddish Brown by Farrow & Ball is our favorite. —Molly Kidd Light and Dwell

While I typically lean toward more neutral palettes I believe we’ll see kitchen cabinet colors continue to gravitate to maroon and jewel tones. —Anthony D’Argenzio Zio and Sons

Yellow

It’s sunny and optimistic but at the same time there are loads of historic precedents to look to for inspiration. It’s a color that works on a Shaker panel as well as a contemporary slab cabinet profile. Give it a bit of green undertone for a little edge or go buttery for full-on comfort mode. —Victoria Sass Prospect Refuge Studio

I am having a love affair with the color yellow. It is so cheerful and bright like the sun. It would be a chic color for cabinetry; you can mix it with a cool blue quartzite for a timeless and vibrant kitchen. —Sara Story Sara Story Design

All shades of yellow! And then of course green. Green is evergreen in my book. —Faith Blakeney

Purple

I see all different shades of purple coming back from lavender to aubergine and I wouldn’t be surprised to find this tranquil and sophisticated color showing up on kitchen cabinets as well especially since the color is made up of red and blue the color symbols for fire and water—the two elements deeply at play in the kitchen! —Justina Blakeney The Jungalow

I predict that kitchen paint will continue to move away from monochromatic all white and that more saturated colors will reign in 2024 with saturated earth-tone-based greens terracotta and rich brown shades. And if you want to go riskier then dark reds and purples will also be in the mix. —Kirsten Blazek A 1000x Better

Green

We found that cooler tones are being embraced when it comes to kitchen cabinet colors. Currently we particularly feel strongly about olive green and are loving Rocky River by Sherwin-Williams. —Monet Masters and Tavia Forbes Forbes + Masters

I’ve been really loving green and plum. We’ve used them both in projects recently and I want to see more of them. —Susana Simonpietri Chango & Co.

Pink

I think the next It kitchen cabinet color will be pink! —Clive Lonstein

Pink! —Angus Buchanan Buchanan Studio

Natural Wood

We love mixing wood cabinets with paint-grade cabinets. For example a wood island with a light counter paired with dark counters on a neutral painted cabinet face. For wood stains we generally do custom variations of Rubio Monocoat. Our recent favorite is 50 percent Chocolate 50 percent Burgundy. —Amanda Leigh and Taylor Hahn House of Rolison

Wood cabinets are hitting all the marks. They add warmth and depth and work well in any style kitchen. I am noticing more kitchen cabinets in natural woods paired with jewel-tone paint metal or stone. The wood creates a luxe look that is elegant and timeless. —Delia Kenza",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vY29pbmdlZWsuY29tL2FpLWZvcmdlLWRvbWlub3MtZXllLXRyYW5zZm9ybWF0aW9uLW9mLWZvb2QtZGVsaXZlcnktd2l0aC1haS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AI Forge Domino's eye transformation of food delivery with AI,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='coingeek.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Showroom,"We may earn revenue from the products available on this page and participate in affiliate programs.

Shopping for a new rug online is a gamble: What will the texture look like IRL? What about the feeling underfoot? And of course—did I order the just-right color or is my computer screen playing tricks on me?

With its new Los Angeles showroom Australian floor-covering brand Armadillo has come to the rescue via a sweeping space with a snaking partition that displays its dozens of eco-friendly offerings from jutes that won’t shed to silk and wool weaves in calming sunset shades.

But the real benefit of in-store shopping particularly at this location is the built-in design inspiration that lies within the former nightclub space. Inspired by the organic lines of fashion ateliers in Tokyo and Paris the Armadillo team combined the old with the new an important focus for cofounder Jodie Fried. Because the B Corp focuses on sustainability she didn’t want to tear down the building and start anew. Instead they kept the original glass and metal windows (a nice juxtaposition to the interior’s clean lines) and installed 100 percent renewable electricity.

Oak walls add a soft touch—but they’re actually flooring repurposed as wall paneling (something you can definitely try in your own home). “In each showroom there are generally three materials [and colors] that inform our textural palette: white oak polished concrete and crisp white” Fried says. “In our Los Angeles space since we had already envisioned the concrete foundation and the white partitions we ended up using the hardwood flooring on the walls.”

Another steal-for-your-apartment touch? The living room area designed by Swike which layered two similar-toned rugs (the quiet Eden with the plush Mojave style on top) then added a glass coffee table which lets you see the floor coverings even better while providing visual space too. Fried’s layering advice: “You can keep it quite simple by centering a smaller rug on top of a larger rug for a distinct border or like our Los Angeles showroom you can layer them off-center which feels more relaxed.”

Armadillo’s new Petra rug put to work in its new showroom. Courtesy of Armadillo

And when you’re not soaking up all the good vibes around you make sure to take home samples an essential step in rug buying says Fried: “I can’t stress enough the importance of bringing a rug sample home so you can view it in the intended room in natural light throughout the day against the rest of your decor.” Thankfully you can order them online too wink-wink.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG1lbnRleGVjdXRpdmUuY29tL25ld3MvZnJvbS10aGUtcmVndWxhdG9ycy9jdXR0aW5nLWNvbnN1bHRhdGlvbnMtd29udC1jdXQtcmVkLXRhcGUtaWlhYy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cutting consultations won't cut red tape: IIAC,"IIAC said that while the goal of faster more responsive rule making is a good one that goal won’t be achieved by giving the market less time to assess regulatory proposals.

“The focus of effective policymaking should be on getting things right” it said. “Regulators cannot risk pushing through or being perceived as pushing through a regulatory agenda quickly.”

“A 60-day consultation period gives little time for the public to analyze and respond to proposals that regulators and their many staff have taken a much longer time to put together without the benefit of full public input” it said. “It gives the appearance of an unlevel playing field with a pre-determined result.”

IIAC argued that the minimum consultation period should be 90 days and that this should be reduced only in a crisis that requires swift action to ensure the stability of the financial system — such as a significant market disruption.

“The time allocated to the consultation process should be seen as an investment in better rules and regulations” IIAC said in its letter.

“Shorter deadlines hamper the quality of the process” it argued. “Stakeholders may not be able to fully address the issue or may opt not to comment at all so that regulators lose out on the awareness understanding and detailed knowledge of market participants that are essential ingredients to good regulation.”

Additionally IIAC said reducing the minimum consultation period “moves away from the spirit of accountability and threatens the already lagging public confidence in the integrity [of] regulatory rule making practices.”

“The first step to cutting red tape and reducing the regulatory burden is to base regulatory proposals and decisions on robust cost-benefit analysis and a meaningful informed assessment of risk that is open to public scrutiny” it said.

Moreover it argued that the proposal to reduce the minimum consultation period should be subject to a regulatory impact analysis of its own that considers the direct and indirect costs and compliance costs that would result.

“On its face the proposal to shorten the consultation period brings regulatory burden compliance costs direct and indirect costs and no benefit” IIAC said. “Rules and regulations that are rushed without thorough cost-benefit analysis consideration of alternatives and clear public accountability risk negative outcomes for investors and markets.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoaXNpc21vbmV5LmNvLnVrL21vbmV5L21hcmtldHMvYXJ0aWNsZS0xMjgxMzI1NS9EUC1FdXJhc2lhLWV4dHJlbWVseS1kaXNhcHBvaW50ZWQtdW5zb2xpY2l0ZWQtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tYmlkLmh0bWzSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhpc2lzbW9uZXkuY28udWsvbW9uZXkvbWFya2V0cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEyODEzMjU1L2FtcC9EUC1FdXJhc2lhLWV4dHJlbWVseS1kaXNhcHBvaW50ZWQtdW5zb2xpY2l0ZWQtYWNxdWlzaXRpb24tYmlkLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DP Eurasia 'extremely disappointed' by 'unsolicited' acquisition bid,"Bosses at London-listed DP Eurasia are 'extremely disappointed' at how India's Jubilant Foodworks has approached a potential takeover.

Jubilant has now increased its stake in Domino's Pizza's master franchisee for Turkey Azerbaijan and Georgia from 49 per cent to 53.5 per cent.

Because Jubilant which holds the Domino's franchise in India now owns more than half the London-listed company it now has 30 days to put forward a full offer.

Delivering more: Jubilant has now increased its stake in Domino's Pizza's master franchisee for Turkey Azerbaijan and Georgia from 49 per cent to 53.5 per cent

Jubilant said it would make an 85 pence per share bid for the remaining DP Eurasia shares marking a 24 per cent premium to the group's share price the previous day.

DP Eurasia called the proposal 'unsolicited and unexpected' and asked investors to 'take no action'.

The board of the Amsterdam-headquartered business has now lambasted Jubilant accusing the company on Friday of not trying to agree to a proposed deal before launching an offer.

It told shareholders: 'The board is extremely disappointed that Jubilant Foodworks decided to proceed in this unsolicited and opportunistic way and without first seeking to reach an agreement on terms which the board would be able to endorse as in the best interests of all stakeholders.'

DP Eurasia's bid from Jubliant came on the same day it reported sales jumped by 37.8 per cent in the first ten months of this year thanks to soaring demand in Turkey where it opened 41 new stores.

The franchise operator used to be Russia's third-largest pizza delivery firm until it exited the country earlier this year due to the Ukraine war's escalation.

DP Eurasia decided to initiate bankruptcy proceedings for its Russian subsidiary in August after attempts to find a buyer failed.

Domino's Pizza received severe criticism for continuing to operate in Russia long after many major corporations had already shut down or declared plans to close their operations there.

Although the group ended all investment in Russia and suspended royalty payments in March 2022 it kept restaurants open claiming it was to protect employees and customers.

Nearly 1600 foreign businesses continue to operate in Russia according to the Kyiv School of Economics such as confectionery makers Nestle and Mars and consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble.

London-listed companies named by the organisation include Unilever bottling group Coca-Cola HBC and pharmaceutical firms GSK and AstraZeneca.

DP Eurasia shares were 0.6 per cent or 0.5p lower at 84.5p on Friday morning but have climbed by almost half since the year began."

The utility company announced the sale was completed Friday after quickly securing loan financing and completing a share sale in mid-November to supplement cash on hand. Florida City Gas serves five of the top 10 most populous counties in Florida doubling Chesapeake Utilities’ customer base.

With Florida City Gas’ network of 3800 miles of distribution main pipeline and 80 miles of transmission pipe it also positions Chesapeake Utilities for significant growth.

“We are pleased to formally welcome Florida City Gas and excited about the opportunities we can pursue given our combined capabilities” Chesapeake Utilities President and CEO Jeff Householder said in a statement. “The integration of our businesses creates a compelling foundation: one focused on driving sustainable earnings growth consistent with our long-term track record.”

To fund the acquisition Chesapeake Utilities sold 4.4 million of shares of non-voting common stock at $82.72 per share. Barclays RBC Capital Markets and Wells Fargo acted as joint lead book-running managers for the offer. When the sale closed Nov. 14 the utility company raised $367.2 million.

After announcing the acquisition’s completion Friday Chesapeake Utilities’ share price rose more than 3% to a 60-day high of nearly $99.

Chesapeake Utilities also filed notice with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it will take out six loans totaling $550 million with an average 6.5% interest rate due between 2027 and 2038 to help pay for the acquisition.

Headquartered in east Dover Chesapeake Utilities is a diversified energy delivery company with a concentration on natural gas and offers services in electricity generation propane among others. Among its assets includes 3330 transmission lines across six states and 4900 distribution mains. With more than 100000 residential and commercial customers in natural gas the company has picked up more business throughout the years by acquiring other companies.

Meanwhile Florida City Gas serves about 120000 residential and commercial natural gas customers across eight counties including Miami-Dade and Palm Beach. Florida City Gas has historically shown a 4% annual residential customer growth rate over the last 4 years in part due to the Sunshine State’s growing population with retirees seeking warmer climates.

“Together we’ll strengthen our Florida presence leveraging our core competencies and building upon our strong community and regulatory relationships while continuing to meet the growing demand for natural gas” Householder said.

With Florida City Gas and Florida Public Utilities which Chesapeake Utilities bought in 2009 the company’s operations in Florida are expected to comprise roughly 60% of its operating income according to a presentation made to investors on the deal.

Chesapeake Utilities projects its expenditure guidance to rise 65% to $1.8 billion for the five-year period that ends in 2028. More than two-thirds of the company’s capital projects will now be in Florida including pipeline replacement programs increased transmission capabilities and other expansions to support customer growth.

With this transaction Chesapeake Utilities’ regulated operations are projected to represent approximately 87% of its business portfolio.

“We are excited about the long-term value creation anticipated from the FCG acquisition. Leveraging Chesapeake Utilities’ proven track record and disciplined approach we aim to replicate the success of past acquisitions like Florida Public Utilities” Chesapeake Utilities Chief Financial Officer Beth Cooper said. “We’ve successfully implemented the permanent financing plan for this transaction maintaining a strong balance sheet. Well positioned for 2025 goals we’ll drive earnings growth through strategic investments regulatory initiatives and a continued focus on efficiencies.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiowFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlLTEyODE5MTAzL0h1bmRyZWRzLWlsbGVnYWwtbWlncmFudHMtYXJyaXZlLURvdmVyLXNtYWxsLWRpbmdoaWVzLUNhbGFpcy1tYWtpbmcteWVhci1zZWNvbmQtaGlnaGVzdC1yZWNvcmQtYm9hdC1hcnJpdmFscy5odG1s0gGnAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9uZXdzL2FydGljbGUtMTI4MTkxMDMvYW1wL0h1bmRyZWRzLWlsbGVnYWwtbWlncmFudHMtYXJyaXZlLURvdmVyLXNtYWxsLWRpbmdoaWVzLUNhbGFpcy1tYWtpbmcteWVhci1zZWNvbmQtaGlnaGVzdC1yZWNvcmQtYm9hdC1hcnJpdmFscy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hundreds of illegal migrants arrive in Dover on small dinghies from Calais - making this year the second highe,"Eye-witnesses said they saw at least seven boat-loads being brought back to Dover by Border Force patrols throughout yesterday (sat) as migrants crossed the Channel despite the freezing weather.

This year became the second highest on record despite Rishi Sunak's pledge to reduce the number of boats arriving in Britain for which he handed half-a-billion pounds to the French government to better police its beaches in Northern France.

Since the migrant boat crisis began in 2018 last year had the highest number of migrants reaching Britain with 45774 arrivals on dinghies.

The second highest on record was 2021 with 28526 arrivals. But this year is now set to overtake 2021 as an estimated 28653 have reached Dover if yesterday's figures are included.

Yesterday Border Force cutters were deployed before dawn to pick up migrants in the middle of the English Channel under extremely poor visibility due to the fog. The boats kept on arriving with the last one arriving just before 6pm said an eye-witness.

Last night Labour criticised the Government's efforts to stop the boats which has been one of Mr Sunak's key pledges since becoming Prime Minister.

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: 'Rishi Sunak claimed he would stop the small boats this year but instead this weekend's figures are set to make it the second highest year of crossings on record.

'The Tory asylum chaos is continuing and he has broken another promise he made to the British people.'

But a Government source said: 'Crossings are down by a third in a year. They are trending downwards - whereas across Europe they are going up.'

The source added that Labour is 'getting a free pass' on their illegal migration policy.

He said: 'Their plan to stop the boats is to do in the future what we have already been doing and which is having results.'",,,,,,
DOW,Dow,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRlYWwuY29tL3Njb29wcy1leGNsdXNpdmVzL2Rvdy1jb25zaWRlcnMtb3B0aW9ucy1mb3ItaW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmUtYXNzZXRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dow Considers Options for Infrastructure Assets,"Chemicals and materials giant Dow Inc. (DOW) is working with advisers to consider strategic options for its infrastructure assets along the Gulf Coast three industry sources said.

The company has retained Goldman Sachs & Co. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. to help it structure and run a potential transaction involving the assets two of the sources said. The banks have had the mandate for several months though any formal communication to third parties may remain a few months off the sources said.

While it’s unclear what Dow will bring to market in the Gulf Coast in the near term the company is eventually expected to sell what could amount to some $5 billion worth of assets one of the sources suggested. Buyers may begin to be engaged in the first quarter of 2024 the source also said.

Midland Mich.-based Dow is looking to monetize infrastructure assets that are currently hard to quantify given they have never before been owned by a third party or had a third-party fee structure set up around them a second of the sources cautioned.

The extent of infrastructure assets Dow will ultimately sell couldn’t immediately be learned but the company is expected to consider options for assets such as pipelines water and emission treatment facilities rail lines and some utilities the source added.

Auction at a Glance:

Goldman and Citigroup tapped to sell pool of infrastructure assets

Assets expected to be worth up to $5 billion

Prospective bidders include infrastructure funds large PE firms and energy companies

Chemicals makers have considered infrastructure sales in the past but there have been concern around future relationships with new owners and the chemicals makers the second source said.

For example if a company such as Dow were to sell a water treatment plant it needs to do business and the new infrastructure owner begins to inadequately invest in the facility or wants to raise prices that Dow doesn’t want to pay the chemicals maker can’t let the infra owner shut down its operations the source opined.

A big part of why these types of processes have stumbled in the past has had to do with these relationships not being fleshed out well enough contractually yet said the second source. The person added that this is among the reasons why the preparation process will likely be extensive and that the market may not see all of the assets Dow plans to sell in one package.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9kb3ctbmVhci1yZWNvcmQtaGlnaC1iZWNhdXNlLXRyYWRlcnMtYXJlLWNhbGxpbmctYmx1ZmYtb24taGlnaGVyLWZvci1sb25nZXItZmVkLWJiZTBiMmEy0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9kb3ctbmVhci1yZWNvcmQtaGlnaC1iZWNhdXNlLXRyYWRlcnMtYXJlLWNhbGxpbmctYmx1ZmYtb24taGlnaGVyLWZvci1sb25nZXItZmVkLWJiZTBiMmEy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dow near record high because traders are calling bluff on ‘higher-for-longer’ Fed,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-near-record-high-because-traders-are-calling-bluff-on-higher-for-longer-fed-bbe0b2a2 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldHdhdGNoLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9kb3ctbmVhci1yZWNvcmQtaGlnaC1iZWNhdXNlLXRyYWRlcnMtYXJlLWNhbGxpbmctYmx1ZmYtb24taGlnaGVyLWZvci1sb25nZXItZmVkLWJiZTBiMmEy0gF-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0d2F0Y2guY29tL2FtcC9zdG9yeS9kb3ctbmVhci1yZWNvcmQtaGlnaC1iZWNhdXNlLXRyYWRlcnMtYXJlLWNhbGxpbmctYmx1ZmYtb24taGlnaGVyLWZvci1sb25nZXItZmVkLWJiZTBiMmEy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2VuZXJneS9hcnRpY2xlL2FkdmFuY2VkLW51Y2xlYXItbnVzY2FsZS10ZXJyYXBvd2VyLWRvdy0xODUyMjcwOS5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dow's Corpus Christi project highlights challenge of nuclear energy's revival,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/advanced-nuclear-nuscale-terrapower-dow-18522709.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXN0b25jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2VuZXJneS9hcnRpY2xlL2FkdmFuY2VkLW51Y2xlYXItbnVzY2FsZS10ZXJyYXBvd2VyLWRvdy0xODUyMjcwOS5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ3JlYXRzcGVjdWxhdGlvbnMvMjAyMy8xMi8wMS9kb3ctc3RvY2tzLXRvLXRyYWRlLWluLWRlY2VtYmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here are the Dow Stocks To Trade In December both long and short.,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2023/12/01/dow-stocks-to-trade-in-december/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZ3JlYXRzcGVjdWxhdGlvbnMvMjAyMy8xMi8wMS9kb3ctc3RvY2tzLXRvLXRyYWRlLWluLWRlY2VtYmVyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vZG93LWpvbmVzLXRvZGF5LTEyMDEyMDIzLTg0MDk1NjbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Markets News Dec. 1 2023: Stocks Post Fifth Straight Winning Week as Treasury Yields Retreat,"Equities Wrap: Mega Caps Lag as Beaten Down Banks and Entertainment Stock Surge All three major stock indexes rose on Friday to close their fifth consecutive week of gains.

The Dow Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA) shares rose 4.3% after the pharmacy chain launched its Rx Savings Finder a digital tool to help patients find prescription medication discounts. Salesforce (CRM) rose 3.2% adding to yesterday’s 9% gain. The enterprise software company on Wednesday reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings amid cost cuts and interest in artificial intelligence products.

Intel is a leading provider of PC chips. Walmart (WMT) lost 0.9% the same day it suspended advertising on X the platform formerly known as Twitter after owner Elon Musk agreed with a post claiming Jewish people were promoting hatred against white people. The company’s decision follows similar moves by fellow Dow components Apple (AAPL) and Disney (DIS).

The S&P 500 Ulta Beauty (ULTA) jumped 10.8% after the beauty retailer’s quarterly report beat Wall Street estimates on the top and bottom lines. Paramount Global (PARA) and Warner Bros.

Small Caps Jump to 2-Month High as Yields Fall The Russell 2000 an index of U.S. small-cap stocks rose nearly 2.5% to its highest since September on Friday leaving large-cap peers in the dust as Treasury yields fell on hopes of lower interest rates next year. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury declined 10 basis points to about 4.23%—its lowest since mid-September—after two surveys showed U.S. manufacturing activity slowing as demand for goods eases. Yields continued to slide after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed’s policy rate was “well into restrictive territory.” “The full effects of our tightening” he added “have likely not yet been felt.” Treasury yields especially that of the 10-year note affect interest rates across the economy. Small-cap stocks are particularly sensitive to interest rates since they’re more likely to be smaller companies in the early stages of growth. That growth often depends on borrowing which becomes more costly when interest rates rise.

Marvell Shares Tumble as Revenue Forecast Misses Estimates Citing 'Weak Environment' Marvell Technology Inc. (MRVL) shares fell over 5% Friday after the chip maker's revenue declined and its forecast for the fourth quarter came in lower than expected amid a ""weak environment."" While Marvell's year-over-year revenue decline of 8% was slightly better than analysts anticipated its fourth-quarter forecast of $1.42 billion missed estimates. An adjusted per-share loss of 19 cents was an improvement over the second quarter's 24-cent per-share loss and narrowed from the year-ago loss of 63 cents. Marvell Technology CEO Matthew Murphy blamed the recent lackluster performance on the broader market telling Reuters ""You've seen it in announcements from the big enterprise companies and you've also seen it from the carrier companies. It's a very weak environment."" Despite Friday's decline Marvell shares were up over 46% year-to-date. -Vivian Medithi TradingView

Tesla Falls Again After Cybertruck Roll-Out Shares of electric vehicle leader Tesla (TSLA) fell again Friday after falling more than 1.5% yesterday as it delivered its first Cybertrucks an event four years in the making. In an event live-streamed from the company’s Austin TX headquarters yesterday Musk called the unconventional stainless-steel-encased truck Tesla’s “best product” boasting it has “more utility than a truck” and is “faster than a sports car.” To prove it The event included a video of a Cybertruck beating a Porsche 911 in a quarter-mile race while towing a Porsche 911. The Cybertruck was first unveiled in 2019 and was slated to be rolled out in 2021 but the company model faced several delays amid production difficulties. Musk said in 2019 the truck would start at about $40000 but a lot has changed since then and interested buyers will have to shell out $61000 for the basic model.

Pfizer Shares Drop as It Ends Study of Weight-Loss Pill Due to Patient Side Effects Pfizer (PFE) was the worst-performing stock in the S&P 500 Friday as shares dropped over 4% after the drug maker announced it was ending development of a twice-a-day weight-loss pill because too many patients experienced negative side effects. The company indicated that a Phase 2b study of the drug danuglipron was effective “demonstrating statistically significant change in body weight.” However Pfizer added that while the most common adverse effects were mild and gastrointestinal half of those in the study chose to stop taking it as compared to 40% who were given a placebo. The company said it would not move ahead with a Phase 3 study. The news sent Pfizer shares to their lowest level since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. -Bill McColl TradingView.

Manufacturing Activity Fell in November Amid Waning Demand Economic activity in the manufacturing sector contracted for the 13th straight month in November according to the Manufacturing ISM Report on Business. Meanwhile the S&P U.S. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) was 49.4 in November signaling deteriorating business conditions in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturing business was hurt by a decline in new orders amid “weak client demand economic uncertainty and customers continuing to run down stock levels.” On the plus side manufacturers reported lower input costs as fuel and material price pressures abated. That translated into lower inflation for customers—the pace of price increases for finished goods fell to its slowest since July.

Ulta unlike most other retailers expressed confidence about the coming holiday season. “As we look to the future the outlook for the Beauty category is bright” said CEO Dave Kimball in a company press release. Ulta could be benefiting from the lipstick effect an economic theory that holds that spending on small indulgences such as lipstick increases during recessions.

How smart do you have to be to invest in stocks? According to the late Charlie Munger Warren Buffett’s business partner not very.

“It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid instead of trying to be very intelligent” he once said according to Janet Lowe’s 2003 biography “Damn Right!”

Put simply Munger wasn't looking for a home run or the next big thing. Instead he focused on buying simple businesses for less than they’re worth and holding for the long term.

It’s a simple strategy. Instead of being clever try to be patient. “The big money is not in the buying and the selling but in the waiting” he once explained.

With that in mind here are three stocks that the Munger-style waiting game could work with.

D.R. Horton

Homebuilders recently got a vote of confidence from Buffett himself. The Oracle of Omaha added a few homebuilders to his portfolio including D.R. Horton (DHI). He seems to be betting on a boom in home construction which could be justified by the ongoing shortage of housing across North America.

According to a March report from Realtor.com the U.S. housing market is short 6.5 million units. This gap is expected to grow as Americans form more households than homes being built. Plugging this gap could take decades which is plenty of runway for builders like D.R. Horton.

Meanwhile the stock is undervalued—trading at just 9.4 times earnings per share. This cheap Buffett-backed stock should be on your radar for a long-term investment.

Eli Lilly

Pharmaceutical giants are usually good long-term bets. That’s because once a drug or treatment from their pipeline is approved it can generate revenue and profits for decades. Eli Lilly (LLY) recently received approval for Mounjaro a drug it intends to deploy in the weight loss market. Effectively the company has entered into competition with Ozempic which is one of Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk’s products.

This market could be worth $71 billion by 2032 according to a report by J.P. Morgan stock analyst Richard Vosser cited by Fierce Pharma with Eli Lilly capturing a significant chunk of it.

Story continues

That’s just one drug in a broad portfolio. Eli Lilly already has a track record of steady growth and investment in research and development.As a result the stock has delivered a total return of more than 1000% over the past 10 years.

An impressive history and promising future should put this stock on your long-term watch list.

Microsoft

Savvy investments and early moves have put Microsoft (MSFT) at the forefront of developments in artificial intelligence. And the company already has a significant stake in the most promising startup in this field: OpenAI.

OpenAI’s products like ChatGPT have already been integrated into Microsoft’s software suite. Following the recent drama with CEO Sam Altman the tech giant has also secured a nonvoting seat on the startup’s board.

Microsoft recently expanded this advantage by building its own custom AI chip.

It’s too early to say what impact AI will have on our economy in the future. But it seems increasingly likely that Microsoft will play a pivotal role in this future. That’s why long-term investors should consider adding this stock to their “forever” watch list.

(WILX) - DTE Energy customers will see an increase in their bill after Friday’s approval of a more than $360 million rate increase.

The Michigan Public Service Commission approved a $368 million rate increase for customers of DTE Electric Company. This was a reduction of more than 40% from the initial request of $622 million to boost reliability and speed up the deployment of clean energy generation.

An average residential customer who uses 500 kilowatt hours of electricity per month will see an increase of $6.51 or 6.38% on their monthly bill. The new rates will take effect Dec. 15.

The Commission ordered DTE Electric to conduct a study examining the impact of its on-peak rate structure on low-income customers before they are transitioned to the new time-of-day rates. With time-of-day rates DTE implemented in March 2023 customers are charged more for electricity on weekdays between June and September from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. Electricity demand is at its highest during these times and the additional power is typically at its most expensive to produce.

The Commission approved a 2-year investment recovery mechanism (IRM) designed to help track investments in DTE Energy’s distribution system and ensure continued investment in the distribution grid to improve reliability and resilience. The Commission limited the IRM’s timeframe to 2 years so that it can be adjusted to include findings of a distribution system audit now underway. According to the Commission this is the first time they ordered such a broad top-to-bottom assessment of the distribution systems of Michigan’s two largest electric utilities.

A final report is expected by late summer 2024 on the results of the independent third-party audit.

The Commission approved funding for the company’s strategic capital program to improve reliability and modernize the grid. Noting safety issues with abandoned arc wire in Detroit the Commission approved funding for DTE Electric’s efforts to harden the city’s 4.8 kV grid.

The Commission approved an additional $2 million in funding for DTE Electric’s pilot project to provide $1500 rebates for income-eligible households to purchase electric vehicles costing $50000 or less promoting greater affordability in EV adoption.

The Commission approved the $9 million requested by DTE Electric for its planned 220-megawatt Trenton Channel Battery project which the Commission approved in the utility’s integrated resource plan.

Posthumus says DTE rate increase has begun an ‘era of unprecedented expenses’ for Michigan residents

House Republican Floor Leader Bryan Posthumus on Friday issued the following statement after the Michigan Public Service Commission authorized DTE Energy to raise rates on customers by $368 million — a 6.4% increase.

“We tried to warn everyone this would happen and it sure didn’t take long: the beginning of an era of unprecedented expenses for Michigan families has begun. While the Governor has been saying her Green New Deal would save people money it only took a couple weeks to prove that to be a lie.” Posthumus said. “Turns out all that pie in the sky is actually pretty expensive; green energy fairy tales don’t pay for themselves. By ratifying this deal the commission and Governor Whitmer’s administration are telling us exactly who they are and exactly what they want A black hole has been created pulling in billions of dollars and returning absolutely nothing. And now it is starting to grow.”

DTE specifically petitioned the commission on the basis that it needs this rate increase in part to comply with the state’s wind and solar energy fixation.

“The utility rate hike was announced the same day Governor Whitmer’s population commission released its recommendations on how to grow Michigan’s population.” Posthumus said. “The irony would be hilarious if it wasn’t so disastrous for the people of Michigan. Democrat policies are driving people from this state by making it more difficult to find a job and more expensive to raise a family. The recipe to grow our population has been demonstrated: Affordable cost of living safe communities less red tape for neighborhood job providers and transformational investment in our urban centers. Instead Democratic leadership has chosen to make utility costs skyrocket and entertain tax increases proposed by the ‘population commission.’ They aren’t just shooting from the hip they are firing a machine gun in the pitch black and it’s the people are going to pay for it – literally. ”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiJ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyaWRnZWRldHJvaXQuY29tLzE5NDc0MC0yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DTE monthly rates to jump by 6.4% on Dec. 15 to fund clean energy,"The Michigan Public Service Commision approved a residential rate increase of over $368 million for DTE

Bills for a typical residential customer bill will rise $6.51 per month

The commission approved a $30 million rate hike last November that also increased monthly bills

Michigan regulators on Friday approved a $368 million rate increase for DTE Energy that will increase electricity rates for average residential customers by $6.51 per month or nearly $80 a year.

This story also appeared in Bridge Michigan

That’s less than the $622 million rate increase originally sought in February by DTE the Detroit-based company that serves 2.3 million customers. The company has said it needs to increase rates to improve its grid and speed the transition to clean energy.

The three-member Public Service Commission unanimously approved the 6.4 percent rate increase after conferring behind closed doors. The increase goes into effect on Dec. 15.

The vote came days after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed clean energy bills that mandated utility companies used 100 percent clean energy by 2040.

The new law also requires utility companies to boost their energy-efficiency savings from 1 percent to 1.5 percent.

During debate about the legislation Republicans voiced concerned that utilities would increase rates to meet the 2040 goal. DTE has said it plans $45 billion in upgrades over the next 10 years.

“We tried to warn everyone this would happen and it sure didn’t take long” said House Republican Floor Leader Bryan Posthumus of Cannon Township.

DTE and Consumers Energy the state’s other major utility have faced criticism this year for the duration and frequency of outages the most severe of which left some residents in southeast Michigan without power for a week in February.

Michigan’s outage rate is double the national average and the sixth-highest in the nation according to federal sources. DTE and Consumers have blamed an older grid as well as trees that get entangled in lines.

“Additional investment in the distribution system is necessary to see meaningful improvement in reliability” said Commissioner Katherine Peretick during the meeting.

“The reliability of our electric distribution system in the face of increasing severe storms is unacceptable and the only way to improve is to fix the system.”

The increase comes atop residential bills that the website Statisa estimates are the 11th highest in the nation among states. DTE’s gross profit was $6.5 billion for the fiscal year ending Sept. 30.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXRyb2l0bmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9wb2xpdGljcy8yMDIzLzEyLzAxL2R0ZS1lbmVyZ3ktcmF0ZS1oaWtlLWVsZWN0cmljaXR5LXJlbGlhYmlsaXR5LXBvd2VyLW91dGFnZXMtbWljaGlnYW4tcHVibGljLXNlcnZpY2UtY29tbWlzc2lvbi83MTc2MDAyMjAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michigan utility regulators approve electricity rate hike for DTE Energy customers,"Delta Township — The Michigan Public Service Commission on Friday approved a $368 million electric rate increase for DTE Energy customers for the coming year about 60% of what the Detroit-based utility initially requested in February.

The increase will cost the average residential customer about $6.51 more per month on their electricity bill state utility regulators said. But DTE argued the impact on customers' bills will be offset by more than half because of other recent cost savings realized by the company.

The new rates will be effective Dec. 15 for DTE's 2.3 million electricity customers in southeast Michigan and the Thumb area.

Electricity bills for the typical residential customer will increase 6.4% according to the Michigan Public Service Commission a state panel that regulates utility giants DTE and Consumers Energy.

Commissioner Katherine Peretick said DTE's additional investment in its electricity distribution area is “necessary” to reduce the ""unacceptable"" outages that have plagued Metro Detroit customers in recent years.

""The only way to improve is to fix the system"" Peretick said. ""We’ll be watching closely to ensure these investments have the intended effect of reducing the frequency and duration of outages in our state.""

DTE argued the rates approved Friday were curbed by a decrease the company announced last month of about $300 million due to savings in the fuel and costs associated with the company's production of energy. Balanced against the November decrease Friday's decision averages to an increase of about $2.65 per month for an average residential customer using 500 kilowatt hours the Detroit-based utility said.

“Our customers demand and deserve improved electric reliability; the rate order will allow us to continue to invest in the grid as well as transition to cleaner energy"" said Trevor Lauer vice chairman and group president for DTE Energy.

Republican and Democratic lawmakers greeted the decision with criticism Friday.

Rep. Mike McFall D-Hazel Park said he was ""appalled"" the commission would allow DTE to push the ""financial burden of long-overdue infrastructure upgrades to residents"" based on reasoning that is ""tired and clearly not made in good faith.""

""This is despite DTE recording over $1 billion in net profits last year and after the company boasted about their $332 million 2023 Q3 earnings to shareholders"" McFall said in a statement.

In February DTE asked the commission to boost its total charges by $622 million annually a few months after the commission approved a nearly $31 million increase in response to a $388 million request.

The $31 million increase DTE said amounted to about a 71-cent increase per month for an average residential user.

The $622 million increase would have amounted to roughly $12.46 more per month for an average customer an increase of about 14%. The company later adjusted its request to $583 million.

While increasing grid reliability was one of the reasons cited for the rate hike request the company said its efforts to comply with its own carbon reduction plans and the state's clean energy goals also came with costs.

Pushback on rate increase

Attorney General Dana Nessel's office has argued DTE's initial $622 million request was nearly twice as much as it needed. Nessel's office estimated DTE's revenue deficiency was at most $326.4 million and that the request by DTE was ""the largest"" the attorney general's office had ever seen.

Nessel said Friday she was pleased the commission listened to the objections of her office but was disappointed regulators didn't adopt other recommended metrics and benchmarks against which DTE's performance could be measured.

“I recognize that $368 million is still a tremendous rate increase and is too high for many ratepayers especially right before the holidays"" Nessel said in a statement. ""I will remain a vocal proponent for the interests of utility customers and urge the Legislature to pass measures compelling DTE to demonstrate this money is being utilized to ensure more reliable service and not to enrich its shareholders.""

McFall said he is exploring ""legislative avenues"" to reform the commission's approval process after his district is consistently offered promises while ""energy reliability continues to deteriorate.""

""We cannot continue to allow DTE aided by the Michigan Public Service Commission to arbitrarily raise rates which hurts our most vulnerable citizens while DTE simultaneously gloats about record profits to their shareholders year after year"" McFall said.

Rep. Mark Tisdel R-Rochester Hills also criticized the increase Friday arguing those rates would only increase in the years ahead as Michigan imposes a law signed this week requiring the state to have 100% ""clean"" energy by 2040.

""As the state ramps up new energy requirements Michiganders’ electricity prices will keep ramping up too"" Tisdel said in a statement. ""We’re already seeing rates rise because of previous ‘clean energy’ regulations and burdensome new laws will require costly investments and make electric bills more expensive for residents and local businesses.""

Howell resident Julie Stachecki Johanningsmeier told commissioners Friday that she supported the rate increases ""as long as the funding that goes to that tree trimming funding surge is not simply to prune more miles but that we are adamant about using best management practices to navigate the natural resource challenges that we have out there.""

She also pleaded for sufficient wages for the tree trimmers and utility workers who work in extreme conditions.

""It is this workforce that keeps the power flowing and I hope your oversight is very close to make sure that some of that funding goes to boots on the ground upon which this entire grid rests"" Stachecki Johanningsmeier said.

Commission grants other DTE requests

The commission's Friday order granted DTE's requested debt-to-capital structure of 50%-50% but lowered the company's approved return on equity from the requested 10.25% to 9.9%.

DTE is expected to make more than $350 million between 2024 and 2025 in investments in the distribution system and distribution grid including breaker replacements underground residential distribution replacements and circuit conversions. The two-year period allows for potential adjustments based on an ongoing distribution system audit the final report for which is expected in 2024.

The commission also approved about $2 million for a pilot project through DTE giving $1500 to certain households that purchase electric vehicles costing less than $50000. The commission approved an acceleration of the utility's ""tree trimming surge"" to prevent trees and branches from falling on power lines during wind storms.

The commission's Friday decision rejected requests for $133 million in information technology costs and $346 million in capital costs because the panel found the costs ""were insufficiently justified.""

DTE has petitioned successfully for rate increases over the past decade and earlier this year the utility implemented ""time of use"" rates that increased rates during peak hours. Part of Friday's order required a study of the impact of the new rates during peak hours on low-income customers.

The Michigan Public Service Commission approved a $368 million rate increase for customers of DTE Electric Co. on Friday.

Today’s approval of a $368115000 rate increase a typical residential customer who uses 500 kilowatt hours of electricity per month will see an increase of $6.51 or 6.38% on their monthly bill. The new rates will take effect Dec. 15.

The regulatory commission said that the vote to approve the rate increase is 40 percent less than the $622 million that DTE Energy originally wanted to fund its planned infrastructure investments to boost reliability and speed up deployment of clean energy.

DTE Energy says that the average customer's bill will be impacted by $3.15 per month due to a recent reduction in rates.

""Our team worked through the math. Offset by a $300 million reduction in fuel and other costs the average DTE residential customer will see a bill increase of 11 cents per day to support needed investments ($3.15 per month)"" said a DTE Energy communications member.

But Michigan United a grassroots watchdog group responded by calling the commission ""toothless"" and said that the body - which is appointed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer - continues to reward the company's poor performance.

""The Michigan Public Service Commission has demonstrated yet again that it is not up to the task of regulating our state’s utilities. Despite years of sustained public outcry against DTE’s unreliable and unaffordable service just in time for the holidays the regulatory body has gifted the company yet another rate increase while Michiganders are getting coal in the form of a bigger bill"" said EM Perry from Michigan United in a release.

DTE Electric’s last rate increase was granted in November 2022 when the MPSC approved a $30557000 increase a 90% reduction from the $388 million the utility had requested for a total increase over a two-year period of 7.16%. Over this same two-year period the US annual inflation rate averaged 6.4%.

DTE Electric serves 2.3 million customers in southeast Michigan.

DTE requested a return on equity of 10.25% and a 50%-50% debt-to-capital structure. Today’s order approves the requested debt-to-capital ratio and sets a return on common equity of 9.9% and an overall rate of return of 5.56% on a jurisdictional rate base of $22150952000.

The Commission approved an additional $2 million in funding for DTE Electric’s pilot project to provide $1500 rebates for income-eligible households for the purchase of electric vehicles costing $50000 or less promoting greater affordability in EV adoption.

The Commission also approved DTE Electric’s request to accelerate the utility’s ongoing tree trimming surge to clear trees and branches from around power lines as fallen trees and branches are the leading cause of outages in Michigan.

The Commission also directed DTE to work with MPSC Staff to study tree trimming on residential service drops — the electric lines between power poles and homes. Maintaining clearance around these service drops is typically the responsibility of homeowners it can impact on the length of outages. The Commission directed DTE Electric to develop a proposal for residential service-drop tree trimming pilot in its next general rate case.

Perry and his group called out the Michigan Public Service Commission's funding - which partially comes from the energy companies themselves.

""Given that most of our state’s legislators take contributions from DTE and Consumers Energy and that a majority of MPSC funding comes from these same companies where should Michiganders direct their calls for accountability?"" Perry said. ""Utility company money is polluting every corner of this state’s democracy. In the pursuit of a fair and transparent regulatory framework Michiganders should rally behind efforts to restrict the sway of utility companies by advocating for the prohibition of political contributions from entities with government contracts thereby fortifying the democratic foundations of our state. Michigan United is preparing to take that fight to Lansing.""

Other aspects of today’s order include:

The Commission approved a 2-year investment recovery mechanism (IRM) that is designed to help track investments in DTE Electric’s distribution system and ensure continued investment in the distribution grid to improve reliability and resilience.

These investments total more than $350 million and will be made in 2024-2025 toward circuit conversions sub-transmission redesign and rebuild breaker replacement underground residential distribution replacements and 4.8 kilovolt (kV) circuit automation.

The Commission limited the IRM’s timeframe to 2 years so that it can be adjusted to include findings of a distribution system audit now underway — the first time the Commission has ordered such a broad top-to-bottom assessment of the distribution systems of Michigan’s two largest electric utilities.

A final report is expected by late summer 2024 on the results of the independent third-party audit which is examining all equipment and operations of the electric distribution systems of DTE Electric and Consumers Energy Co. Partial approval of the IRM maintains the Commission’s focus on ensuring funding for needed reliability improvements while allowing room for adjustment.

Money spent on these costs must be reconciled in a future case that will assess the reasonableness and prudence of the utility’s expenditures and the reconciliation will ensure funds approved for these programs are spent on those programs or else be refunded to customers.

The Commission also approved funding for the company’s strategic capital program to improve reliability and modernize the grid. Noting safety issues with abandoned arc wire in Detroit the Commission approved funding for DTE Electric’s efforts to harden the city’s 4.8 kV grid.

Addressing the company’s planned reliability and resilience investments the Commission directed DTE Electric to:

Include annual metrics on inspection and testing of pole and pole-top maintenance and reporting.

Implement MPSC Staff recommendations for ensuring reliability efforts address the needs of vulnerable communities in the company’s distribution plan case.

Increase transparency in how distribution grid investments are selected and prioritized.

The MPSC ordered DTE Electric to conduct a study examining the impact of its on-peak rate structure on low-income customers before they are transitioned to the new time-of-day rates. With time-of-day rates DTE implemented in March 2023 customers are charged more for electricity weekdays from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. between June and September. Electricity demand is at its highest during these times and the additional power is typically at its most expensive to produce.



The Commission also directed DTE Electric to work with MPSC Staff and stakeholders to develop a detailed regression analysis of customer demographics and reliability for vulnerable communities to be used in the company’s distribution plan case.

The Commission approved $9 million requested by DTE Electric for its planned 220-megawatt Trenton Channel Battery project which the Commission approved in the utility’s integrated resource plan in Case No. U-21193.

The Commission disallowed costs in a number of areas including $346 million in capital costs and $133 million in information technology costs that the Commission found were insufficiently justified. The Commission also disallowed $59.6 million in avoidable capital expenses associated with the company’s planned retirement in 2028 of units 3 and 4 at its coal-fired Monroe Power Plant.

The Michigan Public Service Commission is made up of Dan Scripps Katherine Peretick Alessandra Carreon.

What You Need To Know FBI and Moore County Sheriff’s Office are asking the public for help finding a minivan last seen on Dec. 3 2022



Multiple shots were fired at two Duke Energy electrical substations



The damage caused a massive power outage that impacted 45000



Anyone with information is asked to contact the FBI Moore County Sheriff’s Office tip line or submit a tip online

Multiple shots were fired at the substations approximately 10 miles apart in West End and Carthage N.C. Nearly 45000 people were without power as a result for five days according to the FBI.

Spectrum News 1 reported last year Moore County Sheriff Robbie Fields called the acts an intentional criminal attack on the power stations a key part of the power grid.

City Attorney Palmer Davis told commissioners on Friday that Lakeland could receive about $1.1 million from DuPont and $13.5 million from 3M as part of a $13.6 billion settlement tentatively approved by the U.S. District Court in Charleston S.C.

The money would be set aside for future efforts to detect and remove chemicals known as PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances) from the city’s water supply — although actual remediation costs are likely to be far higher than the payout.

“The way the settlement agreements are structured you’re in the class unless you opt out” Davis explained. The deadlines to request exclusion are Dec. 4 for DuPont and Dec. 11 for 3M.

Davis said Lakeland’s share of the settlement is a “rough estimate” based on allocation tables that factor in the amount of contamination and volume of water. If Lakeland accepts the settlement it cannot sue again later based on new findings.

Several cities have criticized the settlement offer as inadequate and premature saying there’s not enough information about the scope of the problem or the potential costs of addressing it. At least a dozen have opted out to reserve the right to pursue their own claims later. They include: Fort Worth; Portland Ore.; Myrtle Beach Columbia and Lexington S.C.; LaGrange Ga.; Hastings Minn.

“If you opt out of the class you’d have to maintain your own litigation against 3M and DuPont so you’d be engaging in highly complex litigation against international companies” Davis told the commissioners.

The settlement agreement was reached just as the case was about to go to trial after a five-year legal battle that involved 7.4 million pages of discovery documents and 160 depositions.

“It makes a lot more sense to stay in than opt out so that’s my recommendation to you” Davis said. In addition to the expense of pursuing a case he said: “There’s definitely talk that both of these companies may file for bankruptcy. If you’re part of the class you’re a protected creditor. If you go it alone then you’re on your own and you may not get anything.”

An ‘urgent public health issue’

For many decades PFAS chemicals were used to make industrial and consumer products including firefighting foam nonstick cookware grease-resistant food packaging and stain- and water-repellant carpets upholstery and fabrics. This included products labeled Teflon and Scotchguard.

In the “PFAS Strategic Roadmap” for 2021-2024 EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan wrote: “As the science has continued to develop we know more now than ever about how PFAS build up in our bodies over long periods of time and how they can cause adverse health effects that can devastate families.”

Over time researchers have discovered several alarming things:

PFAS chemicals don’t break down in the environment or do so extremely slowly hence the nickname “forever chemicals.”

They’ve been found in air surface water groundwater soil fish and the blood of people and animals all over the world — including Antarctica and the Tibetan plateau.

Exposure has been linked with a variety of health risks including prostate kidney and testicular cancers; decreased fertility; immune disorders; developmental delays and hormone disruption in children; liver and thyroid problems; and increased cholesterol.

In 2016 the Environmental Protection Agency set a “health advisory” guideline for two of the chemicals: PFOA and PFOS. The levels were set at no more than 70 parts per trillion combined in drinking water.

Earlier this year the EPA dramatically lowered the acceptable levels setting the “lifetime health advisory level” for PFOA at .004 parts per trillion and PFOS at .02 parts per trillion. It also established levels for two other PFAS chemicals. Water utilities must report levels of 4 parts per trillion or more.

The EPA has also advised that national legally enforceable drinking water standards are coming with limits for six PFAS compounds and requirements to monitor 29 PFAS compounds.

The challenge for Lakeland

While PFAS have been found in Lakeland’s water the city is within the EPA’s recommended standards — for now Water Production Manager Joe Costine told commissioners Friday.

Lakeland currently gets its water from 19 wells drilled into the Floridan aquifer. The raw water is delivered to two treatment centers where it is softened with lime and disinfected with chlorine: the C. Wayne Combee Plant and the T. B. Williams Plant.

Costine said there are two generally accepted methods to remove PFAS from drinking water: granular activated carbon filtration or reverse osmosis. Lakeland is not presently using either process at its two treatment plants.

“They’re expensive to set up … but the biggest problem is not necessarily the cost of treatment; it’s actually the cost of disposal” Costine explained. “Because then you’ve concentrated a hazardous chemical.” He said the only current method of disposal is incineration at 4000 degrees Fahrenheit and “not just any incinerator can handle that.”

One Florida city that has started removing PFAS from its water is Stuart which is expecting to get more than $100 million from the class action settlement. In 2016 Stuart discovered that the levels in its water supply exceeded federal guidelines. It closed its 24 wells and built an $18.3 million reverse osmosis treatment facility. Costine said Stuart has been shipping the PFAS concentrates by barge across the Gulf of Mexico to an incinerator in Texas.

Testing methods are evolving but Costine said because the amounts are thousandths of parts per trillion it is difficult to know precisely how much PFAS is in the water. Also there are more than 14000 known PFAS compounds but current guidelines only address six.

He said Lakeland will likely have to invest in remediation in the future but abatement processes may also improve and become more accessible.

“Hopefully the regulations will not be too burdensome on us once they pass” Davis said.

Settlement won’t be enough but alternatives are grim

A fact sheet put together by attorneys who brokered the settlements noted that the 3M and DuPont settlements alone won’t be enough to clean up the nation’s water supply.

“The anticipated cost of PFAS drinking water clean-up exceeds the market cap of all potentially liable defendants” the fact sheet says. “It is estimated that it would cost approximately $100 billion or more to address the nation’s PFAS contamination. Finding funding sufficient to address a problem of this magnitude will require more than one funding source.”

The fact sheet says the class action settlements could be combined with other funding sources including about $9 billion earmarked by the federal government for PFAS cleanup.

If municipalities opt out of the settlement the attorneys caution “That will set them back years since they would need to relitigate the issues that the settlements would otherwise resolve and further there is no guaranteed outcome.”

“By contrast the settlements remove litigation risk and will provide funds starting in 2024 so (public water systems) can begin to fix their PFAS contamination problems quickly” it says.

Additionally if too many water systems “seek their own trials or a larger payday 3M and DuPont will have no choice but to exercise their right to terminate the settlements and might well seek bankruptcy protection. If that were to occur (municipalities) would be forced to wait years for the bankruptcy court to sort out all of the defendants’ creditors and water systems could end up with pennies on the dollar at best.”

Lakeland commissioners did not formalize their decision Friday because they cannot vote during agenda study sessions but most seemed to agree with Davis’ recommendation.

There is a City Commission meeting on Monday.

The third annual edition of the company’s Inside Green Innovation: Progress Report reveals that priority patent filings in bioplastics increased by almost a quarter in the 12 months to 2021 (from 458 to 569) with the 2020-21 period revealing a level of innovation in the field not seen since 2002.

Year-on-year rises in patent filings among the different types of bioplastics – including PHAs butylene-based polymers and PLA – is broadly similar while the latter remains ahead of the pack by a total of 93 patent filings in 2021 only 10 filings short of its previous high in 2011. However starch blends’ recent patent numbers have fallen for the first time in six years.

Meanwhile recent innovation activity in chemical recycling of plastics is sharply reversing the decline seen in the previous decade with applications for thermal recycling pyrolysis technology increasing for three consecutive years and up by 25% from 2020 to 2021.

Appleyard Lees patent attorney David Jasiewicz said: “We’re in the midst of a second peak in bioplastics innovation with the 2018-2021 period showing a significant increase in patent filing activity which outstrips the previous pinnacle in the early 2000s.”

Two key bioplastics trends emerge

Technology innovation by the top patent filers indicates two trends in the bioplastics sector: improving bioplastics’ mechanical properties and appearance in line with conventional plastics and improving the materials’ biodegradability.

For example South Korea’s LG Chemical has filed applications including copoloymers of lactones lactic acid and other hydroxyacids aiming to improve thermal and mechanical properties when compared to PLA. It has also shown innovation in resin compositions which blend bioplastics with the intention of replacing traditional plastics such as polyethylene films.

Meanwhile Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation of Japan has focused on improving bioplastics’ biodegradability such as finding bioplastic alternatives to PLA in additive manufacturing and blending polyesters with PHAs to use in shopping bags or food packaging.

CJ Cheiljedang Corporation – better known as a South Korean food manufacturer but now one of the top patent filers in bioplastics – is concentrating on applications with PHA for packaging and multi-layer films.

The proliferation of South Korean patent filings – totalling twice the number of second place Europe – may be driven by its government’s stated aim to reduce plastic waste by a fifth by 2025 and ultimately replacing fossil-based plastics.

Plastics recycling technology expands

Alongside pyrolysis as the dominant method in thermal recycling for plastics Appleyard Lees’ research reveals other technologies growing:

Patent filings for microwave depolymerisation have been mostly increasing since 2014 while bacterial biodegradation – combining chemical catalysts and engineered bacteria such as cells from larvae to convert plastic waste – is now an emerging area attracting patent activity.

Improving the ability to turn recycled plastics into something new has also seen innovation with patent applications remaining constant from 2020-2021.

Partner and patent attorney Chris Mason said: “The sector is showing strong growth both in terms of the number of innovators and the amount of innovation being produced. This reinforces the expectation that chemical recycling growth and innovation is set to continue.”

Countries demonstrating the most innovation activity in this area include South Korea – with filings doubling from 2020 to 2021 – with ongoing interest in the US and Europe. Among companies Eastman Chemical accounts for 26% of patent filings among the top 10 companies protecting their inventions.

The Inside Green Innovation: Progress Report Third Edition’s focus on polymers was chosen because of its prominence in the global green innovation conversation as referenced in the OECD’s and United Nations’ 17 Sustainable Development Goals and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Green Innovation Database a global innovation catalogue that connects needs for solving environmental or climate change problems with sustainable solutions."

His 46-year career took him and his family on 17 moves across New York Pennsylvania Rhode Island Connecticut Maryland and New Jersey.

Second to Jaynne David’s greatest joy was the family and life they built together their eight children five daughters-in-law son-in-law nineteen grandchildren two granddaughters-in-law grandson-in-law and two greatgrandchildren. As Dad and Grandpa he coached multiple sports sat on the sidelines of games and band competitions as the loudest cheerleader (and analyst) gave tractor rides after a long day of yard work regularly spent the day at the movies piloted Sunday drives that usually included a stop at the ice cream stand joyfully danced to “Shout” and “Chantilly Lace” and most importantly instilled in each of them a love of country service and the importance of family.

If there is a love that may have rivaled David’s love for Jaynne and his family it was his love of sports baseball and his beloved Los Angeles Dodgers. His love of more than 70 years included all of the highs and lows of a traditional love story including the admiration of important players the disappointing trades of others the move from Brooklyn to Los Angeles Spring Training trips traveling the country to watch them play in-person staying up late to catch the game live on television sharing the joys of wins the sorrows of losses and analyzing year-round their prospects with his children and grandchildren.

Eaton 48 a recent transplant to Burlington Vermont from Syracuse New York is charged with three counts of attempted second-degree murder in the shooting of three 20-year-old Palestinian men in Burlington on the evening of Nov. 25 on North Prospect Street. Eaton pleaded not guilty. Authorities have said they are trying to determine if the shooting should be investigated as a hate crime.

One of Eaton's attorneys Margaret Jansch of the Chittenden County Public Defender's Office said in an email on Wednesday that neither she nor Eaton had anything to share for this story.

Eaton worked nearly 20 different jobs in nearly 10 years

BrokerCheck is a service of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority or FINRA which provides background information on brokers for investors to consult before trusting their money to a particular broker.

In his BrokerCheck report Eaton listed 19 different jobs he held between April 2014 and January 2023 including stints as a farm assistant night cleaner carpenter landscaper driver farm manager sawyer and maintenance person mostly in small towns in upstate New York.

Eaton was also self-employed from April to August 2021 and again from January to April 2022 in Salisbury Vermont; and from September 2010 to September 2017 in Syracuse.

In most of his jobs Eaton stayed no longer than a few months.

Eaton was also a broker for five different financial firms:

CUSO Financial Services in Williston.

TD Ameritrade in Fayetteville New York.

Edward Jones in East Syracuse New York.

Cadaret Grant & Co. Inc. in Liverpool New York.

Equity Services Inc. in Montpelier.

Eaton's last employer CUSO Financial Services in Williston confirmed to USA TODAY he was fired on Nov. 8 after working for less than a year at the broker-dealer.

""We are horrified by the shooting and are cooperating with law enforcement as they investigate"" spokesperson Jeff Eller said. ""We have no further comment.""

Former employer shocked about shooting

Business Insider interviewed a man named Dick deGraffe who owns an organic farm in Pulaski New York where Eaton managed the finances. DeGraffe told Business Insider he had known Eaton for 25 years and couldn't believe the news about the shooting. He called Eaton a ""bright guy a jack-of-all-trades"" who showed no signs of extremism Islamophobia or racism.

But Business Insider also cited evidence first uncovered by Vice of a ""conspiratorial"" bent in posts on what appear to be Eaton's social media accounts most of which have since been deleted or locked. One on X the platform formerly known as Twitter said ""Libertarians want trans furrys to be able to protect their cannabis farms with unregistered machine guns.""

Further evidence of Eaton's worldview comes in 2004 when the Portsmouth Herald in New Hampshire which belongs to the USA TODAY Network reported Eaton was presenting a lecture at a local church about in Eaton's words ""taking back the money and power that consumers have ceded to multinational corporations.""

Eaton's mother says her son struggled with depression

The Daily Beast interviewed Eaton's mother Mary Reed on Monday who said her son had previously struggled with depression. Reed said Eaton spent Thanksgiving with his family days before the shooting.

“Jason has had a lot of struggles in his life but he is such a kind and loving person” Reed said. “I am just shocked by the whole thing.”

One of Eaton's struggles was with romantic relationships according to a police report. On Oct. 21 2019 two officers from the Dewitt Police Department in New York near Syracuse were dispatched to the residence of a woman who had a previous relationship with Eaton but who said he was now continuing to text her after she told him to stop.

The woman told the officer she had been receiving numerous text messages emails and phone calls from Eaton for the past two days. She said the messages were ""sexual in nature"" but not threatening. She responded to Eaton that she didn't want to see him or communicate with him any further. She called police because Eaton had driven by her home that evening in his grey Chevrolet Silverado. She did not want to press charges she just wanted it to stop.

While the police officers were talking with the woman Eaton drove by for a second time. The officers ""conducted a traffic stop"" to talk to Eaton. Eaton told the officers the woman was sending him ""mixed signals"" and that he was under the impression she still wanted to see him. Wrong the officers told Eaton. She wanted nothing to do with him. Eaton said he understood. No charges were filed.

An ATF agent knocks on the door of Eaton's apartment

Samual Brown a special agent with the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives knocked on Eaton's apartment door at 69 North Prospect St. on Nov. 26 as part of canvassing the neighborhood near the shooting according to an affidavit sworn by Burlington Police Detective Corporal Krystal Wrinn. The ATF was assisting Burlington Police in the investigation.

Brown told a Burlington Police detective that when he entered Eaton's apartment building he heard a noise coming from apartment no. 6 that sounded like a television.

""Upon knocking on apartment #6 the door was answered by a tall white male with graying hair"" Brown said. ""The male opened the door with his hands out at waist height with the palms up and said something to the effect of 'I've been waiting for you.'""

""Why's that?"" Brown asked.

""I'd like a lawyer"" Eaton answered.

Eaton refuses to identify himself asks repeatedly for a lawyer

Eaton unprompted stepped outside the apartment into the hallway where Brown asked if there were guns in the apartment. Eaton said there was a shotgun. When Brown asked if there were other guns Eaton repeated that he wanted a lawyer. At that point Brown ""detained"" Eaton according to the affidavit and asked his name. Eaton would not identify himself and asked for a lawyer again. A search of Eaton for weapons turned up two keys in his pocket which were removed.

After Burlington Police officers arrived to take Eaton to the police department Brown and another ATF agent and an FBI agent searched Eaton's apartment and found no one else there. They did find a 38-caliber Ruger pistol and ammunition described as a Hornaday brand with a ""bright red tip on each projectile."" The pistol was in the top drawer of Eaton's dresser in his bedroom.

The agents also found five cell phones a backpack of hard drives two 20-gauge shotguns a .22 rifle and ""indicia of motive."" What those indications of a motive for the shooting are is not explained in the affidavit.

After the search of his apartment Wrinn and another BPD detective met with Eaton in cell no. 2 at the Burlington Police Department and told him he was being charged with three counts of attempted second degree murder. Wrinn writes that Eaton had no reaction.

""Eaton compliantly went with us for photographs and fingerprints and when I asked if he understood what I had told him he advised he had heard the words"" Wrinn wrote.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vZGFsbGFzaW5ub3ZhdGVzLmNvbS9zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtYW5ub3VuY2VzLWV4ZWN1dGl2ZS1sZWFkZXJzaGlwLWNoYW5nZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines Announces More Executive Leadership Changes,"Southwest Airlines Announces More Executive Leadership Changes ""These changes solidify Southwest's executive leadership team as we work to achieve our objectives for 2024 and beyond"" Bob Jordan Southwest Airlines president & CEO said.

Born on August 4 1956 in Cold Spring Harbor New York Whitman attended the Cold Spring Harbor High School before enrolling at Princeton University where she earned a bachelor's degree in economics. Following this she obtained an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1979.

Whitman began her career in brand management at Procter & Gamble following which she joined Bain & Company as a consultant. She then took on executive roles at various firms including The Walt Disney Company where she was Senior Vice President of Marketing and Hasbro where she oversaw the global management and marketing of the Playskool and Mr. Potato Head brands.

In 1998 Whitman joined eBay a then-fledgling online auction platform as its President and CEO. Under her stewardship eBay grew from a company with 30 employees and US$4m in annual revenue to a global enterprise employing 15000 people with almost US$8bn in revenue by the time she stepped down in 2008. She was instrumental in launching initiatives like ‘Buy it Now’ and led the company through its initial public offering (IPO) in 1998.

“The challenge at eBay was how to keep up with a 70% compound monthly growth rate” Whitman said in a 2016 interview with Harvard Business Review. “But the principles of leadership were the same: clear strategy well communicated well metricked. Celebrate the victories and hold people including yourself accountable for results. When you’re the CEO of a 30-person company that grows to 15000 people as eBay did you have to keep reinventing yourself as the company scales.”

After leaving eBay Whitman ventured into politics running as a Republican candidate for the Governor of California in 2010 but was defeated by Jerry Brown. She returned to the business arena in 2011 as the CEO of Hewlett-Packard. At HP she faced the enormous task of reviving the struggling tech giant. She initiated significant restructuring including the decision to split the firm into two separate companies: HP Inc focused on printers and personal computers and Hewlett Packard Enterprise focused on servers storage and networking.

“The biggest challenge facing the company was that it had too many CEOs in too short a period of time” Whitman said. “I was the third CEO in as many years. That is really tough on a company. And the three CEOs had quite different strategies. When you make changes at the centre they get amplified on the ground in Singapore or Berlin or Rio. The company was not sure what its strategy was and therefore it was difficult for everyone to execute.”

After stepping down as the CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise in 2018 Whitman's next venture was Quibi a short-form streaming platform created by Jeffrey Katzenberg. Launched in April 2020 the platform aimed to revolutionise mobile-first entertainment but struggled to gain traction. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and lacklustre performance Quibi shut down just six months after its launch.

Whitman has been recognised numerous times for her contributions to business. She has been featured on Forbes' list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women multiple times and has received several honorary degrees.

Whitman was confirmed in a unanimous vote by the U.S. Senate as the 18th United States Ambassador to Kenya on July 14 2022. “The U.S.-Kenya partnership is strong built on sixty years of shared values and interests” she wrote in an official post. “Our partnership has enhanced security increased prosperity and improved the lives of Kenyans and Americans.

“Since I arrived in Kenya my team and I have been laser-focused on strengthening the U.S.-Kenya trade and investment relationship in coordination with the Kenyan government.”

Whitman is married to Dr Griffith Harsh a neurosurgeon. They have two grown sons and two grandchildren.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVsbGUuY29tL3VrL2Zhc2hpb24vYTQ1OTE4ODA2L2ViYXktbHV4dXJ5LWdpZnRpbmctZ3JpZmYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Luxury Gift Guide For Pre-Loved Items,"With only a few weeks left until Christmas your mind has probably started drifting to gifting. If luxury items are on your list whether a classic Cartier bracelet for a close friend or a much-coveted sequin Prada handbag that would look perfect on the arm of a stylish family member buying pre-loved is a seriously smart way of treating those you love (yourself included) while leaving a far less prominent mark on the planet.

One of the best places for shopping for pre-loved gems is of course . The platform is a treasure trove when it comes to luxury goods offering designer watches classic jewellery pieces and statement handbags at affordable prices and all of which are covered by eBay’s handy Authenticity Guarantee which ensures designer items over £500 are genuine.

Here we’ve teamed up with singer-songwriter Griff a self-confessed eBay devotee to steal her top tips for shopping for pre-loved gifts this festive season. Read on for her ultimate guide.

Rosaline Shahnavaz

Save gift ideas throughout the year

‘I love pre-loved shopping and gifting because it makes luxury purchases more accessible’ says Griff. ‘It’s also great to give pre-loved items a second home and a new life.’ According to the singer making a note of gift ideas well in advance of the festive season is a smart place to start.

Rosaline Shahnavaz Rosaline Shahnavaz

‘Gifting is like a test of how well you know a person. This summer I was on holiday with a close friend Angel who mentioned she loved this gorgeous green and gold Van Cleef & Arpels bracelet she saw in a magazine. I’ve managed to find it on eBay and it’s going to make the perfect gift for her. Shopping on eBay is great because it means you can give a high-quality premium gift at a reasonable price.’

Be clever with your keywords

‘When searching for items be as specific as possible with your keywords as you’ll get much better results that way’ says Griff. Don’t forget to include all item specifics like colour fabric and even the era of the piece or collection it’s from for optimal results.

If you do have a specific luxury item in mind set alerts so you’ll receive email notifications if it becomes available. You can then place your bid or hit ‘Buy it now’ to snap it up immediately.

TOP TIP: To set an alert search for a specific item and click ‘Save this search’ next to the blue heart to receive email updates

Gift thoughtfully – and practically

‘I try to gift sustainably – if I’m buying a luxury item I want it to be something the recipient will love for many years’ says Griff. ‘For example I’ve been eyeing up a beautiful large leather Bottega Veneta tote on eBay for my stylist Kamran. The small-bag trend is cute but I also think a gift should be practical and big bags are more useful.’

Rosaline Shahnavaz

Seek out the Authenticity Guarantee

‘With eBay’s Authenticity Guarantee you can be sure that designer items you’re buying are 100% genuine’ explains Griff. ‘That’s so important when you’re giving a luxury gift to someone. It means it’s worth its value and gives you peace of mind.’

A team of highly experienced eBay expert authenticators meticulously checks luxury items with a multi-point inspection inside and outside. The item will then be shipped to you with custom documentation to confirm that it has been certified as authenticated by eBay. Not sure if the item you want has been authenticated? Look for eBay’s blue tick for reassurance.

TOP TIP: For best results tick ‘Include description’ under the search button when browsing on eBay as some sellers mention keywords in item descriptions rather than titles

Don't forget to treat yourself

Rosaline Shahnavaz

‘When it comes to gifting you mustn’t forget about yourself’ says Griff. For the singer it’s a gold Rolex Cellini watch she’s spotted on eBay that will be top of her festive wish list this year. ‘Watches are a timeless gift and something you tend to keep for life. And if I’m going for a Rolex I’m going to make sure it’s gold.’

Amazon eBay Facebook Google Instagram LinkedIn Match Group Microsoft Snapchat TikTok and YouTube have signed up to the Online Fraud Charter which ministers say will better protect users.

The tech giants have promised to take tougher action within six months to block and remove scams such as fake adverts and romance fraud from their platforms.

Actions include verifying new advertisers better checks on online marketplaces and giving users of dating sites the opportunity to prove their real identity.

The voluntary charter developed with the tech firms will also seek to prevent ads for age-restricted products such as alcohol or gambling being seen by children.

Interior minister James Cleverly described the Online Fraud Charter as ""a big step forward"" towards protecting the public from ""sophisticated adaptable and highly organised criminals"".

""An agreement of this kind has never been done on this scale before and I am exceptionally pleased to see tech firms working with us to turn the tide against fraudsters"" he added.

The government said each signatory has vowed to work closely with law enforcement to target fraudsters by reporting suspicious activity helping to identify those responsible and removing the content.

Fraud makes up about 40 percent of all crime in England and Wales while 80 percent of all authorised push payment fraud originates from social media or a fake website.

The deputy chief executive of the tech UK trade association Antony Walker said the new measures build on those that tech firms already have in place.

But it will enable ""better and more consistent cooperation between the private sector government and law enforcement"" he added.

EBAY PRICE SPIKE

While the $22.99 theater bucket may seem pricey resellers on platforms like eBay are selling the merch for much more.

The highest listing price for the bucket is a whopping $79.99 which is nearly 3.5 times more than the price of the souvenir at theaters and doesn't include the price of shipping.

The price range for other eBay listings of the bucket is $31.59 to $75 with most falling around $50 to $70.

ERAS BUCKETS

Included in the latest batch of tools released as part of EA’s promise to share accessibility tech with the industry are four patents and a tool for helping analyse photosensitivity risks with games.

The photosensitivity analysis tool is called Iris and effectively looks at frames within videos that could trigger reactions in those with epilepsy or affected by other photosensitive symptoms - for instance due to flashing lights or other “rapidly changing spatial patterns”.

EA themselves have used the tech in sports games including Madden and recent FIFA replacement EA Sports FC 24 with plans to use it more widely in the future.

Image credit: EA

In the case of Iris any developer can go and grab the code for the tool to start using it for free.

The other four accessibility features made public by EA aren’t readymade tools in the same way instead being patents that EA have effectively made open-source - so anyone can create their own version of the patented tech without being sued.

The first is an especially nifty concept for Automated Player Control Takeover which automatically detects if a player stops controlling a game - for example during moments where motor cognitive or visual disabilities may be affecting them. When that happens the tech aims to take temporary control of the game mimicking the player’s movements and inputs within the game itself until the player can regain control.

Along similar lines is the patent for an Adaptive Gaming Tutorial System which caters tutorials and such to each player’s level of skill or way of playing. The patent suggests that the tailored guidance could help disabled players by adjusting the game’s tips on controls and so on to suit their way of playing.

That custom advice is taken a step further in the ambitious-sounding patent for an Animated and Personalized Coach for Video Games. Going beyond just tailoring tips this is outlined as an animated coach of some kind who gives you feedback on your performance in the game through both “in-game and out-of-game insights”. Having an animated character coach you on how to play could apparently help players to enjoy their chosen game more finding it easier to change their play style in response to the custom feedback.

The last patent is something that is more than just an idea and has actually been used in a game appearing in Mirror’s Edge sequel Catalyst. The Route Navigation System works to create routes and navigation pointers through “large and complex game environments” - effectively sounding like a more advanced version of getting GPS directions in open-world games like Saints Row or GTA. EA noted that displaying guidance such as navigation lines can aid with cognitive and visual accessibility when traversing in-game environments.

Again these patents are there for devs to concoct their own solutions to rather than being able to grab existing code for the features. Still it’s lovely to see accessibility features becoming ever-more widespread in games and even major publishers not keeping their tech that can help more people enjoy games locked behind some kind of commercial protection. As developers come up with their own solutions based on these ideas hopefully we’ll see those likewise shared around in an industry-wide effort to improve accessibility for all.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2VhLWdhbWVzLXNodXR0aW5nLWRvd24tc29vbi1saXN0LXNlcnZlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 EA Games Are Getting Shut Down on December 8,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vZ2FtZXJhbnQuY29tL2VhLWdhbWVzLXNodXR0aW5nLWRvd24tc29vbi1saXN0LXNlcnZlcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,

This collaboration aims to extend the reach of Housing Works’ “digital food market” powered by Tangelo enhancing access to nutritious meals for food-insecure New Yorkers especially those with chronic conditions such as HIV/AIDS. Digital food market clients receive two free food boxes monthly for a year with the option to use SNAP benefits thereafter. Clients are given personalized food options empowering them to make choices tailored to their health conditions cultural preferences and kitchen access.

Housing Works a founding member of EngageWell IPA utilizes the Care Your Way initiative a multifaceted healthcare transformation pilot project led by Housing Works together with EngageWell a NYC-based network of 20 nonprofit organizations. The digital food bank is part of this initiative addressing food insecurity and food-sensitive illnesses among low-income New Yorkers particularly in communities of color within EngageWell’s network.

Naomi Harris Tolson Vice President of Healthcare Innovation at Housing Works Inc. said that “ Access to healthy food is a human right and food is medicine! Care Your Way has modernized the food safety-net providing streamlined access to healthy food for clients who need it most. The digital food platform empowers clients to choose healthy food with dignity delivered right to their door.”

With over 89% of New Yorkers living with HIV/AIDS facing food insecurity the Care Your Way program is pivotal in bridging this gap amid a 14% increase in HIV diagnoses in NYC from 2020 to 2021. According to Christopher Joseph EngageWell’s Executive Director “ ending the HIV epidemic and breaking the link between poverty structural racism and poor health which is the mission of our growing network can only be achieved by prioritizing evidence-based interventions that reach New York City’s most vulnerable communities and that can be scaled easily.”

“ As part of our mission to improve the health of New Yorkers and eliminate health inequities Empire is committed to expanding access to nutritious food options across our local communities” said Dr. Mark Levy President and CEO Empire BlueCross BlueShield HealthPlus. “ Our collaboration with EngageWell and Housing Works reflects our shared commitment to innovative programming that treats food as medicine particularly for individuals managing chronic conditions.”

The Care Your Way initiative addresses socioeconomic barriers like food insecurity and medication adherence through an integrated care model that prioritizes patient choice in care and treatment methods. This hybrid approach aims to increase patient satisfaction improve engagement in preventive care and reduce avoidable healthcare spending.

EngageWell ensures comprehensive wraparound patient support through various partnerships and looking ahead the initiative may scale its work through the New York Health Equity Reform (NYHER) Program. Johanne Morne Acting Executive Deputy Commissioner at the New York State Department of Health emphasized in her 2022 Call to Action Letter the importance of addressing larger social issues aligning with the holistic approach of Care Your Way contributing to the broader goals of the Ending the Epidemic (EtE) initiative.

Elevance Health the parent company of Empire BlueCross BlueShield will invest up to $30 million over three years through the Elevance Health Foundation to address food insecurity and promote optimal health through good nutrition. As of September 2023 over $27 million in food as medicine grants has been awarded nationwide.

Empire BlueCross BlueShield will be known as Anthem BlueCross BlueShield effective January 1 2024.

But finding appropriate care can be challenging for pediatric patients and their caregivers.

Partnerships between pediatric behavioral health providers and primary care practices could be one way to improve care integration in the future.

“Three out of four kids start the mental health journey in that pediatrician’s office. It is the largest on-ramp to reach these kids” Natalie Schneider CEO of Fort Health said at Behavioral Health Business’ INVEST event. “The trouble is pediatricians don’t have reliable referral partners. So I think models similar to ours where we wraparound services for pediatricians and keep that pediatrician engaged and informed with clinical progress updates are incredibly helpful. It reduces abrasion for those PCPs as well.”

Fort Health provides pediatric telehealth services. The New York-based company recently raised $9 million in funding.

Integrated care has become a hot topic in the behavioral health field. While most focus on adult primary care and mental health services providers can apply the same principles to a pediatric model.

The business case

These types of partnerships could benefit a patient’s overall health and a behavioral health provider’s business.

“If you think about partnering with pediatricians you can really lower your [customer acquisition cost] and have a sustainable business model with a path to profitability” Shiv Bhavnani senior associate at Two Bridge and founder of GIMBHI said during the panel. “So I think that leveraging primary care has been a theme that we’ve seen even in adult mental health as well.”

Two Bridge is an investment and consulting platform. Its investments include Move This World a social-emotional learning platform and BetterYou a holistic wellness app.

Shiv Bhavnani senior associate at Two Bridge and founder of GIMBHI speaks at INVEST

Schneider noted that this move to a partnership model has helped Fort’s overall business.

“In the beginning when we were experimenting with direct-to-consumer before we fully committed to our PCP referral model the conversion rates for D2C were atrocious” Schneider said. “Our conversion rates from PCPs are really good because the PCPs understand the families. They know which families are waiting and ready for treatment.”

A focus on schools

Another potential partnership opportunity for behavioral health providers is schools. Several big-name deals have occurred between school districts and virtual behavioral health providers. For example in February school-based telehealth company Hazel Health announced a $24 million partnership with the Los Angeles and Compton Unified School District.

But teaming up with schools can have unique challenges.

“For schools we found that it’s a very long sales cycle. And it’s very difficult” Dan Davidson president of Galen Mental Health said on the panel. “Most of the time providers will just give up because the school is very bureaucratic and it’s very difficult to sell into.”

Galen Mental Health operates a network of mental health treatment centers that offers mental health dual diagnosis and eating disorder care for adults and adolescents. The provider was founded in 2021 and is based in Coral Gables Florida.

Dan Davidson president of Galen Mental Health speaks at INVEST

While integrating full-on care models into schools could be challenging schools and universities could be an excellent place to start with preventative care.

“I think an area which is very ripe for innovation is preventive care and taking more of a public health lens” Bhavnani said. “Thirty percent of youth suffer from a mental health issue. By providing care once the problem becomes an actual clinical level are you doing root canals but not doing regular cleanings and checkups? So I think there’s a huge opportunity in youth mental health at the preventive level whether that’s mental health first aid or psychological training and employing those models at universities and schools. There’s a lot of ideas there.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vdXRzcG9ydHMuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy8xMi8xL3dvbWVucy1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLWhvb3BzLWNlbnRyYWwtMjAtMjItbGFkeS12b2xzLXZzLTE2LTEzLW9oaW8tc3RhdGUuYXNweNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hoops Central: #20/22 Lady Vols vs. #16/13 Ohio State - University of Tennessee Athletics,"KNOXVILLE Tenn. -- No. 20/22 Tennessee (4-3) welcomes No. 16/13 Ohio State (5-1) to Food City Center on Sunday evening to play in the 2023 Jimmy V Women's Classic.

In the BRUIN Phase 1/2 trial adult patients with CLL/SLL who have received at least two lines of therapy including a BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor achieved an overall response rate of 72%

INDIANAPOLIS  Dec. 1 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Jaypirca® (pirtobrutinib 100 mg & 50 mg tablets) for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who have received at least two prior lines of therapy including a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor. Jaypirca was approved under the FDA's Accelerated Approval pathway based on overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) from the open-label single-arm multicohort international Phase 1/2 BRUIN trial.1 Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.1

Jaypirca the first and only FDA-approved non-covalent (reversible) BTK inhibitor is a highly selective kinase inhibitor that can extend the benefit of targeting the BTK pathway in CLL/SLL patients previously treated with a covalent BTK inhibitor (ibrutinib acalabrutinib or zanubrutinib) and a BCL-2 inhibitor.12 Jaypirca utilizes a novel binding mechanism and has the largest body of evidence of any targeted therapy in patients previously treated with a BTK inhibitor.12

""Once patients with CLL or SLL have progressed on covalent BTK inhibitor and BCL-2 inhibitor therapies treatments are limited and outcomes can be poor making the approval of Jaypirca a meaningful advance and much-needed new treatment option for these patients"" said William G. Wierda  M.D. Ph.D. professor medical director and CLL section head for the Department of Leukemia at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center . ""Jaypirca offers a new treatment option and different approach to targeting BTK providing clinical benefit for a high proportion of patients with CLL or SLL in the BRUIN Phase 1/2 trial whose disease progressed following treatment with a covalent BTK inhibitor and with a BCL-2 inhibitor.""

The labeling for Jaypirca contains warnings and precautions for infections hemorrhage cytopenias cardiac arrhythmias second primary malignancies and embryo-fetal toxicity. See Important Safety Information below and full Prescribing Information for additional information including dosing modifications.

""This FDA approval — the second for Jaypirca in 2023 — underscores the impactful clinical benefit of continuing to leverage the BTK pathway with Jaypirca for patients with CLL or SLL as seen in the BRUIN trial"" said Jacob Van Naarden  chief executive officer Loxo@Lilly. ""These first two indications for Jaypirca represent the beginning of the eventual impact that we hope Jaypirca can have for patients and we look forward to seeing the results of the comprehensive Phase 3 development program across CLL SLL and MCL.""

""The treatment landscape for CLL has been dramatically improved by the introduction of covalent BTK inhibitors and BCL-2 inhibitors. However most patients will unfortunately relapse eventually"" said Brian Koffman  M.D. chief medical officer and executive vice president at the CLL Society . ""Pirtobrutinib's approval gives patients a much-needed option and brings forward new possibilities as they continue their treatment journey.""

The FDA approval is based on data from a subset of patients in the BRUIN Phase 1/2 trial. The assessment of efficacy was based on 108 patients with CLL/SLL treated with Jaypirca who were previously treated with at least two prior lines of therapy including a BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor. Jaypirca 200 mg was given once daily and was continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with active central nervous system (CNS) involvement by lymphoma or allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) within 60 days were excluded. Patients in the efficacy-eligible population had received a median of five prior lines of therapy (range: 2 to 11). The most common prior BTK inhibitors received were ibrutinib (97%) acalabrutinib (9%) and zanubrutinib (0.9%). Seventy-seven percent (77%) of patients discontinued the last BTK inhibitor for refractory or progressive disease. Efficacy was established based on ORR and DOR as assessed by an independent review committee (IRC) using 2018 International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (iwCLL) criteria. Efficacy results are summarized below:

Outcome Jaypirca 200 mg once daily (N=108) Overall Response Rate

ORR n (95% CI %) 78 (72 %) 63 80 PR n 78 (72 %) Time to Response Median (range) months 3.7 (1.7 27.9) Duration of Responsea

Median DOR months (95% CI) 12.2 (9.3 14.7)

CI confidence interval; PR partial response. a Based on Kaplan-Meier estimation. Estimated median follow-up was 15.7 months.

The pooled safety analysis of the full BRUIN study population evaluated 593 patients with hematologic malignancies administered Jaypirca 200 mg daily as a single agent. In this pooled safety population the most common adverse reactions (ARs) to Jaypirca therapy occurring in 20% of patients or more including laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophil count decreased hemoglobin fatigue decreased lymphocyte count musculoskeletal pain decreased platelet count diarrhea COVID-19 bruising and cough.

The safety of Jaypirca was evaluated in the BRUIN trial in 110 patients with CLL/SLL with 98% receiving at least two prior lines of systemic therapy including a BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor. Sixty percent (60%) of these patients were exposed to Jaypirca for at least one year and 14% were exposed for at least two years. ARs led to dose reductions in 3.6% treatment interruption in 42% and permanent discontinuation of Jaypirca in 9% of patients. ARs that resulted in permanent discontinuation of Jaypirca in more than 1% of patients included second primary malignancy COVID-19 and sepsis. Serious ARs occurred in 56% of patients who received Jaypirca. Serious ARs occurring in greater than or equal to 5% of patients were pneumonia (18%) COVID-19 (9%) sepsis (7%) and febrile neutropenia (7%).

Lilly is committed to delivering on the requirements of the FDA's Accelerated Approval pathway including the completion of confirmatory studies supporting traditional approval as soon as possible. The Phase 3 randomized confirmatory trial intended to convert this approval to traditional approval is BRUIN CLL-321 which reached its target number of progression-free survival (PFS) events and met its primary endpoint. Topline results were shared with the FDA in November 2023  although these data have not yet been formally reviewed. BRUIN CLL-321 is a randomized Phase 3 trial comparing pirtobrutinib monotherapy versus the investigator's choice of either idelalisib in combination with rituximab or bendamustine in combination with rituximab in patients with CLL/SLL who have been treated with at least a BTK inhibitor. These data will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting. Jaypirca is not approved for use in the BRUIN CLL-321 population.

This is the second FDA-approved indication for Jaypirca following the January 2023 Accelerated Approval for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) after at least two lines of systemic therapy including a BTK inhibitor.

Loxo@Lilly is studying Jaypirca in CLL/SLL in multiple Phase 3 studies. Details on the trials can be found by visiting clinicaltrials.gov.

About Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma

CLL and SLL are forms of slow-growing non-Hodgkin lymphoma that develop from white blood cells known as lymphocytes.56 CLL is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults.5 In the U.S.  CLL accounts for about one-quarter of the new cases of leukemia and there are approximately 18740 new cases of CLL diagnosed this year.57 SLL is identical to CLL from a pathologic and immunophenotypic standpoint with the main difference between them being the location of the cancer cells.5 In CLL the cancer cells are present in the blood and in SLL the cancer cells are found in the lymph nodes.5

INDICATIONS FOR JAYPIRCA

Jaypirca is a kinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of

Adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) after at least two lines of systemic therapy including a BTK inhibitor.

Adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia or small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who have received at least two prior lines of therapy including a BTK inhibitor and a BCL-2 inhibitor.

These indications are approved under accelerated approval based on response rate. Continued approval for these indications may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR JAYPIRCA® (pirtobrutinib)

Infections: Fatal and serious infections (including bacterial viral fungal) and opportunistic infections occurred in Jaypirca-treated patients. In a clinical trial Grade ≥3 infections occurred in 24% of patients with hematologic malignancies most commonly pneumonia (14%); fatal infections occurred in 4.4%. Sepsis (6%) and febrile neutropenia (4%) occurred. In patients with CLL/SLL Grade ≥3 infections occurred (32%) with fatal infections occurring in 8%. Opportunistic infections included Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia and fungal infection. Consider prophylaxis including vaccinations and antimicrobial prophylaxis in patients at increased risk for infection including opportunistic infections. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms evaluate promptly and treat appropriately. Based on severity reduce dose temporarily withhold or permanently discontinue Jaypirca.

Hemorrhage: Fatal and serious hemorrhage has occurred with Jaypirca. Major hemorrhage (Grade ≥3 bleeding or any central nervous system bleeding) occurred in 3% of patients including gastrointestinal hemorrhage; fatal hemorrhage occurred (0.3%). Bleeding of any grade excluding bruising and petechiae occurred in 17%. Major hemorrhage occurred in patients taking Jaypirca with (0.7%) and without (2.3%) antithrombotic agents. Consider risks/benefits of co-administering antithrombotic agents with Jaypirca. Monitor patients for signs of bleeding. Based on severity reduce dose temporarily withhold or permanently discontinue Jaypirca. Consider benefit/risk of withholding Jaypirca 3-7 days pre- and post-surgery depending on type of surgery and bleeding risk.

Cytopenias: Jaypirca can cause cytopenias including neutropenia thrombocytopenia and anemia. In a clinical trial Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias including decreased neutrophils (26%) decreased platelets (12%) and decreased hemoglobin (12%) developed in Jaypirca-treated patients. Grade 4 decreased neutrophils (14%) and Grade 4 decreased platelets (6%) developed. Monitor complete blood counts regularly during treatment. Based on severity reduce dose temporarily withhold or permanently discontinue Jaypirca.

Cardiac Arrhythmias: Cardiac arrhythmias occurred in patients who received Jaypirca. In a clinical trial of patients with hematologic malignancies atrial fibrillation or flutter were reported in 3.2% of Jaypirca-treated patients with Grade 3 or 4 atrial fibrillation or flutter in 1.5%. Other serious cardiac arrhythmias such as supraventricular tachycardia and cardiac arrest occurred (0.5%). Patients with cardiac risk factors such as hypertension or previous arrhythmias may be at increased risk. Monitor for signs and symptoms of arrhythmias (e.g. palpitations dizziness syncope dyspnea) and manage appropriately. Based on severity reduce dose temporarily withhold or permanently discontinue Jaypirca.

Second Primary Malignancies: Second primary malignancies including non-skin carcinomas developed in 9% of Jaypirca-treated patients. The most frequent malignancy was non-melanoma skin cancer (4.6%). Other second primary malignancies included solid tumors (including genitourinary and breast cancers) and melanoma. Advise patients to use sun protection and monitor for development of second primary malignancies.

Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Jaypirca can cause fetal harm in pregnant women. Administration of pirtobrutinib to pregnant rats during organogenesis caused embryo-fetal toxicity including embryo-fetal mortality and malformations at maternal exposures (AUC) approximately 3-times the recommended 200 mg/day dose. Advise pregnant women of potential fetal risk and females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for one week after last dose.

Drug Interactions



Strong CYP3A Inhibitors: Concomitant use with Jaypirca increased pirtobrutinib systemic exposure which may increase risk of Jaypirca ARs. Avoid use of strong CYP3A inhibitors with Jaypirca. If concomitant use is unavoidable reduce Jaypirca dosage according to approved labeling.

Strong or Moderate CYP3A Inducers: Concomitant use with Jaypirca decreased pirtobrutinib systemic exposure which may reduce Jaypirca efficacy. Avoid concomitant use of Jaypirca with strong or moderate CYP3A inducers. If concomitant use with moderate CYP3A inducers is unavoidable increase Jaypirca dosage according to approved labeling.

Sensitive CYP2C8 CYP2C19 CYP3A P-gp or BCRP Substrates: Concomitant use with Jaypirca increased their plasma concentrations which may increase risk of adverse reactions related to these substrates for drugs that are sensitive to minimal concentration changes. Follow recommendations for these sensitive substrates in their approved labeling.

Use in Special Populations



Pregnancy and Lactation: Due to potential for Jaypirca to cause fetal harm verify pregnancy status in females of reproductive potential prior to starting Jaypirca and advise use of effective contraception during treatment and for one week after last dose. Presence of pirtobrutinib in human milk is unknown. Advise women not to breastfeed while taking Jaypirca and for one week after last dose.

Geriatric Use: In the pooled safety population of patients with hematologic malignancies patients aged ≥65 years experienced higher rates of Grade ≥ 3 ARs and serious ARs compared to patients <65 years of age.

Renal Impairment: Severe renal impairment increases pirtobrutinib exposure. Reduce Jaypirca dosage in patients with severe renal impairment according to approved labeling.

But one could be better positioned to extend that winning streak over the next decade.

It's rare for a prescription drug to become part of the cultural landscape. However that's exactly what has happened with Ozempic. Hollywood celebrities and social media have put the GLP-1 agonist in the spotlight.

Novo Nordisk (NVO -0.73%) has no complaints. Thanks largely to the tremendous success of Ozempic and its sibling Wegovy shares of the Danish biopharmaceutical company have soared.

However another drugmaker hopes to push Ozempic and Wegovy to the side. And its share price has skyrocketed too. Is Eli Lilly (LLY -0.67%) a better stock to buy and hold over the next 10 years than Novo Nordisk?

Ozempic/Wegovy vs. Mounjaro/Zepbound

Arguably the most important arena that will determine whether Lilly or Novo Nordisk perform better over the next decade is the competition between Ozempic/Wegovy and Mounjaro/Zepbound. Ozempic and Wegovy are actually the same drug (semaglutide) with Ozempic approved for type 2 diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss. It's a similar story for Lilly. The company's Mounjaro and Zepbound are the same drug (tirzepatide) with Mounjaro approved for type 2 diabetes and Zepbound approved for weight loss.

Wall Street analysts think Lilly will come out on top in this head-to-head marketplace matchup. Some predict that Mounjaro and Zepbound will combine for peak annual sales of more than $50 billion.

Why do analysts favor Lilly over Novo Nordisk? Clinical studies have already demonstrated that Mounjaro is slightly more effective than Ozempic at controlling blood sugar in patients with type 2 diabetes. The bigger story though is with weight loss. A recent analysis of real-world data conducted by Truveta Research found that patients taking Lilly's Mounjaro were significantly more likely to lose weight after three months than patients taking Novo Nordisk's Ozempic.

Both Lilly and Novo Nordisk are also advancing other diabetes and obesity therapies in clinical testing. Lilly is evaluating a couple of drugs in late-stage clinical studies -- orforglipron and retatrutide. Novo Nordisk's pipeline features late-stage candidates CagriSema and an oral version of semaglutide.

Beyond the diabetes and obesity battles

Although Novo Nordisk focuses heavily on diabetes and obesity it also markets several rare-disease drugs. The company is especially strong in the hemophilia and human-growth disorder markets.

Novo thinks that semaglutide could be effective in treating nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) a liver disorder that has become a major burden to healthcare systems. It's even evaluating the drug as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease. The company's pipeline also includes late-stage programs targeting cardiovascular disease and sickle cell disease.

Meanwhile Lilly has several commercially successful drugs outside the diabetes and obesity space in its lineup. They include breast cancer drug Verzenio and autoimmune disease drug Taltz both of which are blockbusters with growing sales.

Lilly awaits regulatory approval of Alzheimer's disease drug donanemab. It's evaluating another experimental Alzheimer's therapy remternetug in late-stage testing. The company is also conducting late-stage studies with the hopes of expanding tirzepatide into obstructive sleep apnea and heart failure.

Lilly or Novo Nordisk?

My view is that both Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk could be successful investments over the next 10 years. However I think that Lilly is more likely to deliver stronger growth. The efficacy advantages offered by Mounjaro and Zepbound should play a key role. So should the company's Alzheimer's disease autoimmune disease and cancer therapies.

It's important to note though that Lilly's valuation reflects expectations of higher growth. Its stock currently trades at more than 48 times expected earnings well above Novo Nordisk's forward-earnings multiple of 31 times.

However these ratios only look out a year into the future. I suspect that Lilly's earnings will continue to grow at a much stronger rate than Novo's. As a result I pick Lilly as the better stock to buy and hold over the next 10 years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMDEvd2h5LXBmaXplcnMtc3R1bWJsZS1pbi10aGUtb2Jlc2l0eS1tYXJrZXQtaXMtYS1ib29uLWZvci1lbGktbGlsbHktLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Pfizer's stumble in the obesity market is a boon for Eli Lilly,"Pfizer (PFE) has suffered another setback in its efforts to develop a weight-loss pill — and that's good news for Club holding Eli Lilly (LLY) as it looks to maintain an edge in the fast-growing obesity-treatment market. Pfizer said Friday it will discontinue its twice-daily weight-loss pill danuglipron after patients in a mid-stage trial experienced high rates of side effects like nausea and vomiting. More than 50% of recipients stopped taking the drug all together the company said. Pfizer said it will focus future development of danuglipron on a once-daily version of the drug. In June the New York-based pharmaceutical giant stopped developing a different obesity pill known as lotiglipron  due to concerns about liver safety. Shares of Pfizer tumbled nearly 5% Friday to around $29 each. Meanwhile Eli Lilly shares were mainly flat in afternoon trading at around $591apiece. ""I don't think this should be going down"" Jim Cramer said Friday referring to Eli Lilly stock. For the year shares of Eli Lilly have soared more than 60% — significantly outperforming the S & P 500 — largely tied to optimism around its obesity-treatment pipeline. We lifted our Eli Lilly price target Friday to $630 per share up from $600. LLY .SPX YTD mountain Eli Lilly's stock performance in 2023 compared with the S & P 500. Eli Lilly and Danish rival Novo Nordisk (NVO) are the two dominant players in the obesity market. Pharmaceutical analysts widely expect both companies to continue to dominate in the medium term despite competition from other drugmakers such as Pfizer Amgen (AMGN) and AstraZeneca (AZN). Pfizer's latest setback ""could further widen Lilly and Novo's leads"" Bank of America analysts said in a note to clients Friday — a view we share. As Jim argued in November after AstraZeneca bought the rights to an experimental obesity pill from a Chinese biotechnology firm Eli Lilly — and Novo Nordisk for that matter — has an incumbency advantage. The longer it takes for competitors to get to this burgeoning market the more revenue first-movers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk can capture. Our preference for owning Eli Lilly over Novo Nordisk comes down to Eli Lilly's broader drug pipeline including its Alzheimer's treatment donanemab that's awaiting U.S. regulatory clearance. Right now the leading weight-loss drugs — Novo's Wegovy and Lilly's recently approved Zepbound — are injectable. Wegovy and Zepbound are in an emergent class of drugs known as GLP-1s which mimic a hormone in the gut to assist in blood sugar control and effectively suppresses appetite helping contribute to weight loss. Novo's Ozempic and Lilly's Mounjaro are GLP-1s used to treat type-2 diabetes. Drugmakers and analysts alike see oral treatments playing an important part in a GLP-1 market that some Wall Street firms project will eventually generate at least $100 billion in annual revenue. The thinking is that daily obesity pills will appeal to more people than a once-weekly injection even if the pills lead to less weight loss. Pills are also easier to manufacture than injectable GLP-1s. Eli Lilly has advanced its leading oral GLP-1 known as orforglipron to large-scale phase-three studies after releasing impressive phase-two trial results in June . The large-scale studies are expected to be completed in 2025 according to the U.S. National Library of Medicine. In the mid-stage trial patients who took the highest dose of orforglipron on average lost nearly 15% of their body weight. Between 10% and 17% of patients on the once-daily drug stopped taking it due to side effects much lower than Pfizer's more-than-50% discontinuation rate for twice-daily danuglipron. Novo Nordisk's leading obesity pill — semaglutide which is the same active ingredient in Wegovy and Ozempic — is a bit further along than Lilly's. The company has said it expects to apply for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by year-end. In a late-stage trial  overweight adults who took the oral version of semaglutide lost up to 15% of their body weight over a 68-week period. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long LLY.

The new Eli Lilly plant is anticipated to generate over 1000 jobs encompassing roles within the facility and contributing to increased opportunities for subcontractors and suppliers in the region. While specific details about the products to be manufactured at the plant are yet to be disclosed sources suggest a focus on diabetes drugs with potential applications in treating obesity.

Eli Lilly's decision to fully fund the project independently reflects the company's commitment to expanding its production capabilities and meeting the growing demand for its diabetes drug Mounjaro. The drug known for its off-label use in weight loss recently gained additional approval in the United States for this purpose under the new brand Zepbound. Eli Lilly's portfolio also includes diabetes drugs such as Trulicity.

The town of Alzey strategically located within an hour's drive of key players in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries is expected to benefit significantly from Eli Lilly's investment. The decision to establish a major production complex in Germany underscores the pharmaceutical industry's ongoing efforts to enhance resilience and responsiveness in the face of evolving global challenges.

While Lilly has not officially commented on the plans scheduled news conferences in Alzey and Berlin are expected to provide further insights into the company's expansion strategy and the specific aspects of its production activities in Germany. The move reinforces the pharmaceutical sector's commitment to adapting to changing dynamics and prioritizing localized manufacturing to ensure a robust and agile response to healthcare needs."

Looking at the trailer above fans of the Fallout games (particularly the most recent ones) will feel right at home in this wasteland which honestly feels like a stew of almost all of them. The story picks up over 200 years after a nuclear war in 2077 when the world adopted a retro-50s “futuristic nostalgia” vibe with hover cars butler robots and oldies music. Like the first game in 1997 the show takes place in Los Angeles. But its story and timeline definitely take more of a page from Fallout 3 where a Vault Dweller named Lucy (played by Yellowjackets‘ Ella Purnell) ventures out into the world for the first time and has to contend with a brutal unrelenting world.

Lucy hails from Vault 33 a totally new Vault but one that definitely seems similar to Vault 101 in Fallout 3. There appears to be an insurrection of some sort plus Lucy has a tearful moment with an older man — Overseer Hank (Kyle MacLachlan) — who might be her father. If this really is like Fallout 3 then her reason for leaving the Vault might be to chase down her dad. You’ll also notice she wears the classic Pip-Boy of course and will apparently come across the NCR’s Brotherhood of Steel faction. (We could very well see a war between the NCR and Brotherhood during this show in fact.)

And yes fans will also apparently get to see loads of iconic Fallout creatures wreaking havoc. The oversized radroaches a fearsome Yao Guai plus all the calm murderous robots left over from the past. We see a gunslinging Ghoul (Justified‘s Walton Goggins) who might actually be Raul Tajeda from Fallout: New Vegas since we know ghouls can live a long long time…

ENPH recently commenced shipment of its IQ8P microinverters with a peak output power of 480 watts (W) to Mexico. These microinverters with a 12-year limited warranty should enable ENPH to capture more shares of the expanding Mexican solar market.

Rationale Behind IQ8P’s Launch in Mexico

A rapid adoption of renewable energy sources has been boosting the solar market in Mexico in recent years. The nation’s regulatory authorities have been playing the role of a key growth catalyst for the solar industry here.



As stated by International Trade Administration Mexico’s Energy Transition Law and General Climate Change Law require the nation to generate 35% of electricity from clean energy sources by 2024 including power regeneration from renewable sources like solar.



Looking ahead according to a 2022 report by the National Renewable Energy Labs Mexico’s national technical potential includes 24918 gigawatts (GW) of solar photovoltaics. This surely reflects the solid demand that Mexico’s solar market has to offer thereby boosting the need for high-powered solar modules.



To cater to such modules Enphase Energy’s IQ8P microinverters which come with a peak output AC power of 480 watts and are designed to pair seamlessly with a full range of solar modules up to 670 W DC seem to be the perfect choice. These microinverters can manage a continuous DC current of 14 amperes thereby supporting high-powered solar modules through increased energy harvesting.



Undoubtedly the availability of such a remarkable product in Mexico’s solar market will attract solar installers to choose Enphase Energy’s microinverters thereby fetching notable revenue growth for the company.

Growth Prospects in Mexico

Mexico’s solar market provides significant growth opportunities primarily due to increased investment and deployment of solar plants and various government policies favoring the development. According to a report by Mordor Intelligence firm the aforementioned solar market is poised to witness a CAGR of 8% during 2020-2025.

Such solid market growth opportunities in Mexico’s solar industry should boost Enphase Energy which already enjoys a strong presence in this market. Evidently in 2021 the company launched its Enphase Installer Network (EIN) in Mexico. Notably EIN members get a state-of-the-art digital platform that delivers sales leads and self-service tools. Members can also utilize the metrics and analytics to boost business efficiency and drive bottom line.

With Enphase Energy’s EIN already available in Mexico’s solar market the recent launch of the company’s IQ8P will surely strengthen its position in this space.

Decentralized power generation continues to grow providing companies in the solar power sector more opportunities to develop technologies to support both economic and efficiency gains be it with better equipment software or installation strategies. New technologies for residential (Figure 1) and commercial and industrial solar power applications are being introduced regularly which means customers have more choices when it comes to determining what works best as they design a distributed generation system.

“Businesses and labs are examining various technologies for enhancing future distributed solar power generation at the residential level. One notable area of research is advanced energy storage solutions” said Kelly Warner CEO of Lumin a company involved in responsive load control. “Solid-state batteries and next-generation lithium-ion technologies are at the forefront of these developments offering the potential for increased energy density extended lifespans and enhanced safety. These improvements are essential for optimizing the benefits of residential solar systems allowing homeowners and utilities to store excess energy and use it when needed.”

Ryan Pierce solar business development manager at Houston Texas–based NOV Renewables told POWER “At NOV we are seeing a surge in interest for distributed solar power generation more specifically in the commercial and industrial sectors. Over the past few months we have received multiple bid requests that include the integration of advanced solar panels available in the market from brands like Canadian Solar which has been at the forefront of solar technology innovation.”

For more insight into distributed solar power generation read this POWER Interview with David Dunlap of BayWa r.e.

Pierce said those innovations in panels “have shown exceptional performance with bifacial gains upwards of 20% allowing them to capture sunlight from both the front and rear sides of the panel. These panels boast nominal max power ratings of over 800 watts and module efficiencies that surpass 26%. Although the initial costs of these larger panels are higher compared to their lower-wattage counterparts and they result in fewer panels being installed per row the increased module efficiency and total overall wattage output contributes to a reduction in the levelized cost of energy.

“Additionally the proportion of total commercial electricity sales to commercial non-profit and public entities met by onsite solar is experiencing a significant upswing” said Pierce. “This growth is predominantly driven by major retailers technology companies operating data centers educational institutions and government and municipal buildings who are all seeking to meet their electricity demands through solar power.”

Advanced Technologies

Warner said utilities can benefit from integrating distributed solar and energy storage managed by smart panel technology. “This approach allows them to participate in demand response programs ensuring more efficient grid operations cost-effectiveness and enhanced grid reliability” said Warner. “Ultimately the amalgamation of distributed solar power generation and smart electrical panels presents a remarkable opportunity for utilities to play a central role in a more equitable clean energy future. It enables them to meet the challenges of rising energy demand while contributing to grid stability and cost-efficiency through effective demand response strategies.”

Those strategies include the use of new technologies designed for better efficiency and that can offer cost savings. Pierce said “The trend in the distributed generation space is evolving with a noticeable shift from fixed-tilt systems to trackers driven by several technical factors. The overall cost of single-axis tracker projects has fluctuated in recent years … depending on site layout tracker projects [may] prove more economical than their fixed-tilt counterparts.”

“Microgrids and the integration of several technologies like solar energy storage load control and EV [electric vehicle] charging are the hot topics in the distributed renewable energy industry” said Will White solar application specialist with Fluke Solar. “As technology evolves they’ll work together seamlessly to provide a comprehensive energy solution.”

Enphase already introduced the company’s IQ8 series microinverters the industry’s first grid-forming microinverters with split-phase power conversion capability enabling efficient conversion from DC power to AC power. Andy Newbold Enphase’s head of Corporate Affairs told POWER “The brain of the semiconductor-based microinverter is our proprietary application-specific integrated circuit [ASIC] which enables the microinverter to operate in grid-tied or off-grid modes. This chip is built in advanced 55-nm [nanometer] technology with high-speed digital logic and has super-fast response times to changing loads and grid events alleviating constraints on battery sizing for home energy systems.”

Newbold also noted Enphase “is now working on the IQ9 family of microinverters which is expected to be introduced to the market in 2024.” Newbold said the IQ9 microinverters will support even higher DC input currents and higher AC grid voltages.

SolarEdge in September introduced the company’s bidirectional DC EV charger which enables solar-powered vehicle-to-home (V2H) and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) functionalities. The company as part of its appearance at September’s RE+ trade show in Las Vegas Nevada (POWER is a media partner for the event) also showcased its Home Hub and Wave Inverters. These next-generation inverters include embedded power control systems that allow more than 50% larger systems to be installed without main panel upgrades.

The company also introduced commercial innovations such as the SE-330K Inverter and H1300 Power Optimizer for community solar and agriculture-related PV applications. It also unveiled the SolarEdge ONE Manager an energy management system for commercial and industrial applications. It’s a cloud-enabled platform that provides real-time data analytics on energy production consumption EV charging and load management while reducing operational costs.

Anker SOLIX this year introduced what the company called a “hybrid category” to its residential line of solar energy products highlighting both its X1 Home Energy Solution and the F3800 Portable Power Station at the RE+ event. The X1 is designed to provide long-lasting backup power to the home. The system’s flexible modular design is customizable with up to six battery packs per system (30 kWh) or up to six systems in parallel (180 kWh) storing solar power for use as needed such as in the event of an outage.

During blackouts the X1 will work with the homeowner’s PV panels to power the home seamlessly switching to off-grid mode in less than 15 milliseconds. The company said that through the Anker app users can manage all aspects of the X1 system and control energy usage for other devices including heat pumps generators EV chargers and more.

Anker SOLIX said the F3800 Portable Power Station is the first of its type to feature AC coupling; it can support home solar power cycling when paired with the Anker SOLIX Home Power Panel. It offers 6000 watts of AC power output and 120V/240V dual voltage output enabling it to simultaneously power high-energy devices. The system includes a 3.84-kWh internal battery for extended backup power.

Solar Building Facades

ENVELON based in Germany is involved with building integrated photovoltaic or BIPV technology that “utilizes the unused building envelopes for onsite solar power generation” according to the company. Gary Shaver the company’s president and managing director for North America told POWER the company leverages the latest solar and building industry technologies to suit several building types (Figure 2) working with both new construction and retrofits. The company’s approach to distributed solar provides greater access to solar in urban areas with Shaver noting that includes areas where it may not be feasible to install rooftop solar due to heating ventilation and ari conditioning systems or building amenities including rooftop gardens or playgrounds.

“ENVELON transforms conventional buildings into beautiful state-of-the art solar power plants using its solar facade system” said Shaver. “A combination of cutting-edge solar and color technologies generates climate-friendly electricity from solar energy in a safe and reliable manner.”

Shaver told POWER “The ENVELON system takes advantage of a variety of industry-trusted mounting substructures that are hidden behind ENVELON’s architectural facade panels which allow for effective installation and maintenance. Both the mechanical connections to the building and the associated electrical wiring conform to building and electrical safety codes.” The company currently is focused on cutting-edge nano-ceramic color coating technology that is infused directly into the glass which means it is not exposed to weathering and enabling improved laminate adhesion.

Shaver said the company can provide different colors and patterns “for its frameless glass facades that combine beauty and functionality. Each color is realized using an ultra-thin internal coating that selects a specific component of the color spectrum—achieving greater than 90% light transmittance for some colors while generating solar-powered energy.”

Solar Storage and EV Charging

Olaf Lohr business development manager at AutoGrid a software group told POWER: “Lately we are seeing more hybrid inverters that integrate solar PV and batteries as well as integrated battery storage systems that can accept direct input from solar PV.” Lohr said that while solar and EV charging are not directly linked aggregators including AutoGrid “are solving part of this issue by providing price or GHG [greenhouse gas] signals to direct EV charging toward periods of abundant solar production. This resolves the issue by integrating intermittent PV production with EV charging in a way that is driven by consumer behavior.”

Said Lohr: “The best battery storage systems to pair with customer-sited solar are those that can help customers maximize the full value stack. These systems should provide backup power manage demand charges accommodate time-of-use pricing and enhance self-consumption. This is important when the value of solar is decreasing due to new net energy metering regulations. Additionally ideal battery storage systems to pair with distributed solar should optimize energy flows behind the meter.”

Lohr continued: “In terms of new technologies we are seeing a closer integration of PV and EV charging including V2G into consumer opportunities. These are supported by intelligent systems that optimize for energy bills and GHG emissions and they can also connect to support an evolving grid.”

About $100 million in billing rebates will be issued to 730000 Entergy Arkansas customers as soon as Feb. 1 the utility said Thursday. Arkansas ratepayers had already received about $42 million in credits when Entergy reduced its fuel charges in March.

The rebates would be in response to a proposed settlement the Arkansas Public Service Commission has approved related to overcharges involving the utility's Grand Gulf nuclear plant in southern Mississippi. The proposal is awaiting approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

This time around the credit will actually reduce the amount a customer owes the month the rebate is issued and will appear as a specific line item on bills according to Danni Hoefer chief of staff at the Public Service Commission which filed the settlement proposal Nov. 17.

""We anticipate there would be an insert in the bill"" Hoefer said Thursday. ""They will likely do something like that.""

Both Entergy and commission officials issued statements Thursday noting the settlement avoids ongoing ""costly litigation"" on an issue that has been contested for six years and involved 19 cases. Federal utility regulators along with public service agencies in Arkansas Louisiana and Mississippi contended Entergy's mismanagement of Grand Gulf led to excess charges for ratepayers in the states.

Louisiana is still contesting Energy's settlement offer while Mississippi ratepayers have received $300 million in credits related to the issue.

""Grand Gulf Nuclear Station has remedied the billing issues that led to Entergy Arkansas ratepayers being over-billed"" the commission said in a statement. ""Once the settlement agreement is approved by FERC Entergy Arkansas LLC will issue refunds to customers possibly as early as the first quarter of 2024.""

Entergy's statement also noted the settlement resolves a long-running dispute.

""This settlement resolves costly litigation and will result in meaningful benefits for customers"" the company said noting that details of specific ratepayer refunds will be available after further approvals. ""Once the settlement is approved by FERC Entergy Arkansas will make a filing at the [public service commission] to calculate the amount customers will receive on their bill and subsequently issue refunds.""

Last August the commission led by then-Chairman Ted Thomas rejected the settlement offer calling it a ""low-ball amount"" that didn't cover ratepayer losses. Thomas resigned in September and another commissioner who rejected the proposal also left the commission. The revamped agency accepted the offer that was previously rejected.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is handling the case because Grand Gulf operates as a wholesale power supplier selling electricity to Entergy Arkansas Inc. and other Entergy subsidiaries in Louisiana and Mississippi. System Energy Resources Inc. (SERI) the Entergy unit that generates and distributes power from the Grand Gulf nuclear station is the primary entity involved in the lawsuits.

Based on the recovery-cost structure for Grand Gulf established by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Arkansas would be in line to receive the largest settlement. The regulatory commission's formula says Entergy Arkansas is responsible for 36% of Grand Gulf's operating costs for the life of the plant which has been approved to continue to provide power until 2044. The federal formula has Mississippi picking up 33% of the costs while Louisiana pays the remaining 31%.

The lawsuit that spurred the settlement proposals began in 2017 when Mississippi regulators filed a claim with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that Entergy's return on investment for the power plant was inflated and led to unnecessary bill increases for ratepayers.

Regulators in Arkansas and Louisiana joined the complaint which also claimed that ratepayers were charged for other unnecessary costs including executive compensation private airplane travel lobbying expenses advertisements promoting Entergy and industry association dues.

Estimates from the Encyclopedia of Arkansas project ratepayers in the state have been charged $4.5 billion for costs related to Grand Gulf from 1985 to 2012.

Development activities in PNW’s service territories will improve the company’s overall performance.



However this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has to face risks related to any unplanned outages in its nuclear generation facilities.

Tailwinds

Pinnacle West has a capital investment plan of $5.45 billion for 2023-2025 at an average annual growth rate of 5-7%. PNW expects transmission investments of $315 million for 2023 up nearly 45% from the year-ago level. The company projects long-term retail customer growth of 1.5-2.5% and weather-normalized retail electricity sales growth of 4.5-6.5%.



PNW anticipates new investments and establishment of businesses to increase demand for its services. Taiwan Semiconductor has increased its investment from $12 billion to $40 billion for the new projects. These projects when fully constructed will create a working space of nearly 3 million square feet and generate demand for electricity.



The company is using new technology to provide high-quality services to customers. It is also working toward obtaining cost savings which will help keep customer rates low.



Pinnacle West continues to focus on enhancing its renewable capacity. During 2023-2025 the company is expected to invest nearly $1.31 billion in boosting clean power generation. The company will develop 1600 megawatts of clean energy and storage that are expected to be placed in service by 2024 for Arizona Public Service Company customers.

Headwinds

Potential volatility in market prices of fuel electricity and other renewable energy commodities could create operational risks for the company. Pinnacle West has nuclear generation facilities that need to undergo thorough safety security and other licensing requirements. The company will be affected by any unplanned outage in nuclear plants stemming from safety concerns and unexpected production stoppage.

Moreover if planned maintenance outages of the nuclear units continue longer than expected it will adversely impact production and operations.

Every week Tracey Ryniec the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio  shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.

Charlie Munger the Executive Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway best friend of Warren Buffett and legendary investor recently died at age 99. One of his most well-known pieces of advice he gave over the years to Warren Buffett was to not just buy cheap companies but to buy great cheap companies.

It sounds so simple right?

But finding “great” companies that are flying under the radar is difficult.

2 Methods for Finding Great Companies

1. You Know It When You See It

There is no scientific algorithm behind method #1. Many times you will simply know a company is cheap and that it’s a great company by instinct.

2. Run a Screen

For the purposes of this podcast Tracey ran a Zacks premium screen looking for both value and growth using the PEG ratio. It also incorporated the top Zacks Ranks of #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy).

This screen returned 13 top cheap stocks with growth.

5 Cheap Value Stocks: But Are They Great?

1. General Motors Co. GM

General Motors has been a cheap stock for years. It currently trades with a forward P/E of just 4.1.

This move supplements an earlier cut of equal size that was set to expire signaling a commitment to stabilize prices. However these reductions are voluntary and raise questions about their sustainability. The surprise move by major producer Brazil to join the cartel next year was another talking point.



Despite OPEC+ announcing nearly 2 million barrels per day (bpd) of cuts American benchmark prices fell by over 2% yesterday. The voluntary nature of the cuts left investors nonplussed. Further the cuts while substantial include extensions of existing curbs by Saudi Arabia and Russia leaving the market seeking stronger commitments.



According to us any weakness in oil allows long-term-oriented market participants to buy shares in quality companies at attractive prices. As it is the commodity is still trading above $75 per barrel — a healthy enough level for market participants.

As prices at U.S. gasoline stations keep on sliding to an average of $3.25 per gallon OPEC+ strives to address economic challenges and fears of flat oil prices without further output caps. Despite the latest reduction analysts remain cautious pointing to global economic uncertainties expanding production capabilities outside OPEC and abundant oil inventories. As a matter of fact the price of WTI crude fell $1.90 or 2.4% to $75.96 per barrel in response to news of the voluntary cuts.

Brazil’s Entry Makes Things Challenging

In a surprising development Brazil has joined OPEC+ a move that adds complexity to global oil dynamics. The South American nation a potential partner for the United States in efforts to influence gasoline prices has aligned with OPEC+ which already controls 40% of the world's oil supply. This decision poses a setback for U.S. attempts to keep pump prices down and reflects a significant market power victory for OPEC+.

OPEC Grappling With Several Complex Questions

Internally OPEC+ faced challenges in reaching a consensus on voluntary cuts due to tensions among member nations. Externally a glut of oil in the market driven in part by increased U.S. production — currently the highest on record — presents a hurdle. China's economic struggles further dampen global demand forecasts. Despite OPEC+'s efforts the road to higher oil prices seems uncertain amid these challenges.

This landmark charter is dedicated to speeding up climate action and achieving high-scale impact across the oil and gas sectors.

""EQT is proud to join this landmark charter. EQT has been at the forefront of emissions reduction for years. Our aggressive net zero targets vigorous efforts to reduce methane emissions commitment to transparency and focus on supporting our peers make us a natural fit"" said Toby Z. Rice EQT President and CEO. ""At EQT we are guided by the higher purpose of providing energy security to the world while lowering global emissions. Joining the OGDC will help ensure that the energy we produce is done so responsibly. We encourage our peers to join us in these efforts so that we can accelerate global decarbonization and advance the world's energy transition together.""

The OGDC which has been signed by 50 oil and gas companies supports the aims of the Paris Agreement and calls for the industry to align around net zero by or before 2050 zero-out methane emissions and eliminate routine flaring by 2030. Beyond decarbonization signatories recognize it is essential for the oil and gas industry to increase actions including engaging with customers investing in the energy system of the future and increasing transparency in measurement reporting and independent verification. The charter is a key initiative under the Global Decarbonization Accelerator (GDA) which was launched at the World Climate Summit today. The GDA focuses on three key pillars: rapidly scaling the energy system of tomorrow decarbonizing the energy system of today and targeting methane and other non-CO2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

EQT has been an industry leader in reducing methane and other GHG emissions. The Company has set aggressive emissions reduction targets pledging to achieve net zero GHG emissions on a Scope 1 and Scope 2 basis by or before 2025.1 Last year EQT reached a significant milestone in its journey to net zero eliminating 100% of natural gas-powered pneumatic devices from its production operations which reduced the Company's annual carbon footprint by over 300000 MT CO2e.2

Just yesterday the Oil & Gas Methane Partnership 2.0 (OGMP 2.0) announced that it awarded EQT a ""Gold Standard"" rating the highest reporting level under the initiative for a second year in a row in recognition of the Company's ambitious methane emissions reduction targets and advanced commitment to accurately measuring reporting and reducing its company-specific and site level methane emissions.

About EQT Corporation

EQT Corporation is a leading independent natural gas production company with operations focused in the cores of the Marcellus and Utica Shales in the Appalachian Basin. We are dedicated to responsibly developing our world-class asset base and being the operator of choice for our stakeholders. By leveraging a culture that prioritizes operational efficiency technology and sustainability we seek to continuously improve the way we produce environmentally responsible reliable and low-cost energy. We have a longstanding commitment to the safety of our employees contractors and communities and to the reduction of our overall environmental footprint. Our values are evident in the way we operate and in how we interact each day – trust teamwork heart and evolution are at the center of all we do.

1 EQT's net-zero emissions target is based on Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from assets owned by EQT on June 30 2021. Scope 1 GHG emissions included in the target are based exclusively on emissions reported to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (Subpart W) for the onshore petroleum and natural gas production segment.

2 Emissions reduction projections are based on anticipated abated emissions from EQT's historical assets as well as acquired assets from Alta Resources Development LLC and Chevron U.S.A. Inc. Due to how emissions from pneumatic devices are calculated under the EPA's Subpart W the full effect of the emissions reduction from pneumatic device replacements will not be reflected in the Company's annual emissions inventory until the Company reports emissions for calendar year 2023. Additionally while EQT replaced 100% of the natural gas-powered pneumatic devices utilized in its production operations as of December 31 2022 the Company may from time to time reinstitute the use of natural gas-powered pneumatic devices in temporary situations particularly in remote locations and while servicing or fixing non-natural gas-powered pneumatic devices. The ultimate reduction of GHG and methane emissions from the Company's pneumatic device replacement program will therefore fluctuate depending on the number and length of time of use of such temporary natural gas-powered pneumatic devices.

Toby Rice CEO of EQT Corp. said he has a simple proven and effective solution.

“Our energy transition plan is to transition the world from coal to gas and transition gas to a zero carbon energy solution and unleash U.S. LNG” Rice said at Hart Energy’s DUG Appalachia Conference in Pittsburgh on Nov. 30.

“LNG is the vehicle that will allow us to transition the world from coal to gas.”

Carbon capture and hydrogen will be the vehicles that allow the transformation from natural gas to net-zero carbon solutions he added.

“We believe we can do this without sacrificing energy security keeping energy affordable and reliable and the end result will be a pretty significant impact on the emissions front as well.”

But obstacles remain blocking the way forward.

Rice said that last year was the first in the last three decades in which fewer pipelines were built in the U.S.

Gas demand increased 56% since 2010 Rice said. But pipeline capacity hasn’t kept pace ticking up 25% while storage infrastructure has grown about 10%

The U.S. has met demand through excess midstream capacity that was built during previous generations.

“Well that can only last for so long and unfortunately we're now at a point where our pipeline capacity is maxed out” he said. “This means we're going to be in a very volatile period.”

Geopolitical events cyber-threats and capacity concerns are clear and present dangers to the industry’s ability to meet demand he said. The industry no longer has the necessary flexibility to manage a potential crisis.

‘Train wreck’ coming

A catastrophic event on the horizon wouldn’t occur because natural gas lacks reliability Rice said. Rather policymakers have not focused on the dependability of the power grid. The nation has been here before. Many energy policies to address the grid were the results of 1970s freezes in the Northeast that made it necessary to close hospitals and schools that were “literally freezing” he said.

“The lack of energy education in this country is one of our biggest challenges” Rice said. “It's also one of our biggest opportunities because when people learn more about our industry they're going realize everything we do is heavily scrutinized and [is] the best way to produce energy.”

The story is simple he said. The push against fossil fuels has been easy because no one in the U.S. has seen the impact of blocking pipelines and shutting down reliable coal facilities. But the impact is coming; it was also preventable he said.

“When this train wreck hits it I think that people are going to wake up and they're going to get back to reality and we're going to get back to work doing practical things” Rice said.

But there will also be finger-pointing at the industry and now is the time to let people know this is a “very dangerous game” that can be prevented.

“We have the resources the ability and the drive to be a real solution provider here and address any problems” he said. “You'd think after Europe people would really wake up” Rice said referring to gas shipments being cut by Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.

The shale revolution has allowed the U.S. to evolve from coal to natural gas. Doubling down on natural gas is a proven and cost-effective way to lower emissions Rice said.

Instead leadership in states like Michigan are betting on 100% renewable power by 2040.

Such states could get lucky or “They'll find out really quickly that it's it's a really bad plan” he said.

People are blocking development in the U.S. and paying more to import power. Plans like the one in Michigan perpetuate the problem.

“It doesn't make sense” Rice said. “It's just a sign of the root cause of this whole thing. Political force has overridden market forces.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbmV3cy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvaG90ZWxiZWRzLWUzYm4tc2FsZS1wcm9jZXNzLXByb2NlZWRzLWxhdGVzdC1kZWFsLXBpcGVsaW5lLTIwMjMxMjAx0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGVuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZXMvaG90ZWxiZWRzLWUzYm4tc2FsZS1wcm9jZXNzLXByb2NlZWRzLWxhdGVzdC1kZWFsLXBpcGVsaW5lLTIwMjMxMjAx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hotelbeds €3bn sale process moves forward – latest Deal Pipeline,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.penews.com/articles/hotelbeds-e3bn-sale-process-proceeds-latest-deal-pipeline-20231201 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBlbmV3cy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvaG90ZWxiZWRzLWUzYm4tc2FsZS1wcm9jZXNzLXByb2NlZWRzLWxhdGVzdC1kZWFsLXBpcGVsaW5lLTIwMjMxMjAx0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucGVuZXdzLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZXMvaG90ZWxiZWRzLWUzYm4tc2FsZS1wcm9jZXNzLXByb2NlZWRzLWxhdGVzdC1kZWFsLXBpcGVsaW5lLTIwMjMxMjAx?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIzLTEyLTAxL2VxdWl0cmFucy1pcy1zYWlkLXRvLWNvbnNpZGVyLXN0cmF0ZWdpYy1vcHRpb25zLWluY2x1ZGluZy1zYWxl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mountain Valley Pipeline Owner Is Said to Consider Options,"Why did this happen?

In 2024 Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) the company that retains the rights to the market’s adopted methodology to measure consumer credit risk will charge one price – higher than the current price – to all mortgage lenders independent of their volumes. The change represents a departure from the tier-based pricing structure it implemented in early 2023.

FICO will also collect the same per score price for soft pulls and hard pulls next year an initiative that started in 2023 despite significant differences in these products.

“FICO will collect approximately $10 total for all three scores out of a $50 (or more) tri-merge report and score bundle which continues to constitute a low percentage (approximately 20% or less) of the overall cost of a tri-merge report” a spokesperson for FICO wrote in a statement to HousingWire.

For 2023 FICO said it would collect approximately $2 to $8 for all three score tiers out of a $40 to $50 (or more) tri-merge report and score bundle and out of an average $3800 in closing costs. Compared to 2022 mortgage lenders in 2023 saw a price increase between 10% and 400% mortgage trade groups and other stakeholders said.

For 2024 two mortgage executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation told HousingWire that they expect prices to increase by more than double in some cases. Ultimately the sources added that lenders will charge more to their borrowers who are already facing affordability challenges.

“It seems like only yesterday you could pull a single borrower tri-merge for $15 and a joint for $30” Greg Sher Managing Director of NFM Lending wrote in a LinkedIn post that went viral in the mortgage industry. “Now those prices will be in the neighborhood of $50 and $100 respectively — one well-known widely used credit reporting agency plans on charging $75/$150. For clarification purposes every IMB uses 3rd party vendors (also known as credit reporting agencies).”

Scott Olson executive director at the Community Home Lenders of America (CHLA) said that increasing prices in this difficult economic environment will “only make it difficult for borrowers to participate in the American dream.”

Soft and hard pulls

Another change for 2024 is related to the pricing structure of soft pulls which are performed to provide pre-approval letters only visible to the borrower and without impacts on credit scores. Its prices will come closer to those applied to hard pulls which are recorded on the borrower’s credit report visible to anyone and can trigger leads.

“Last year we implemented a tier-based pricing structure for mortgage originations and FICO collected the same per score wholesale price for most soft pulls as hard pulls but some lenders qualified for a lower price in certain cases for some soft pulls” the spokesperson for FICO told HousingWire.

Brendan McKay president of advocacy at the mortgage broker group Association of Independent Mortgage Experts (AIME) complained FICO doubled the cost of hard pulls at the beginning of 2023.

“Now they are charging the same amount for a soft credit pull an inherently inferior product that provides less actionable information than a hard credit pull. There has been no justification given for the increased expense.”

According to McKay the cost burden will be passed directly onto consumers and those from underserved communities will feel it most.

“Despite being a private institution FICO is currently a critical component in the mortgage process. As an industry we owe it to future homeowners to bring attention to the misuse of power” McKay said.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are moving away from the current Classic FICO credit score model requiring lenders to use two credit scores generated by the FICO Score 10 T and the VantageScore 4.0 models which are considered more inclusive than their predecessor.

Price to originators

A FICO representative said the company does not set the retail price for end users.

Ultimately “Anything above these wholesale prices charged as part of a tri-merge score and report bundle is collected and retained by others who sell and distribute the scores” the spokesperson said.

Credit bureaus which work with the FICO model may pass the FICO price increases to their clients.

TransUnion and Experian did not reply to a request for comments.

Meanwhile a spokesperson for Equifax wrote to HousingWire that beginning in January 2024 it will have a price adjustment to “reflect cost increases from third-party providers of credit reports and credit scores.”

However the spokesperson added “Equifax is sensitive to the impact these third-party cost increases may have on customers especially given current market conditions. With this in mind Equifax is not increasing the costs related to the Equifax credit file component of the tri-merge credit report for 2024.”

The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) president and CEO Bob Broeksmit said that “In light of these media reports about another round of unexplained sharp price increases we reiterate our concerns about the lack of transparency into the factors that are driving these pricing changes.”



“Given the unique market structure and limited options for obtaining credit reports and credit scores MBA urges policymakers to examine the drivers of these cost increases to ensure transparency and to protect consumers from paying higher costs in connection with their home mortgages” Broeksmit said.

Here’s what company feds say you should do,"Blue Shield of California members with vision coverage may have had highly sensitive personal information stolen in a hack the insurer said.

Blue Shield in letters to affected policy holders offered a year of free identity monitoring and provided advice. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission also provides guidance for people worried they may have been victims of identity theft through stolen personal information.

The credit monitoring from Sunnyvale-based Kroll includes alerts when a person’s credit data changes for example when a new line of credit is opened in their name; or when someone’s data shows up for illegal sale; or when names aliases or addresses become associated with a person’s Social Security number; or when a cash-advance or short-term loan is taken out using a person’s information. The service also includes up to $1 million for eligible out-of-pocket expenses related to an identity-fraud event plus consultation with a fraud specialist and if necessary an investigator.

Here’s what Blue Shield advises for affected members:

1. Regularly and closely review credit reports and financial account statements for suspicious activity and notify financial institutions and relevant companies if such activity is found. Identity fraud should be reported to law enforcement and to the Federal Trade Commission and/or the state Attorney General’s office.

According to Equifax’s latest consumer research over two-fifths (45%) of Australians intend to invest in property (purchase renovate or build a home or investment property) in the next five years. However nearly half (47%) cite lack of trust in the building or construction industry (34%) and/or a lack of qualified contractors or builders in the market (32%) as the biggest barriers.

The construction industry is responsible for 31.5% of all insolvency cases recorded in Q3[1] which adds further pressure to the sector with almost seven in ten (68%) Australians concerned about the rising insolvencies and their potential impact on housing supply.

Building quality is another concern affecting the industry with two-fifths (41%) of Australians saying that their homes and apartments have visible damage and structural or design issues. The research also reveals that Australians would be willing to spend extra to be on the safe side – over three in five (63%) are willing to pay more to get the assurance of working with trustworthy property developers or building professionals.

“Only one in three Australians has a positive perception of the industry – and there is a big gap to bridge. However we know there are many capable reliable and resilient industry players that are dedicated to doing the right thing. The opportunity is there to rebuild consumer trust and for trustworthy building professionals to benefit from improved market confidence” says Brad Walters head of product and rating services at Equifax.

On the current supply shortage impacting the market more than half of the respondents (56%) say there are not enough homes to consider buying or moving into while nearly two-thirds (64%) are concerned that the low supply level coupled with high demand will negatively impact building quality in the country.

“How can we support consumers and create an opportunity for the building and construction industry after a period of turbulence? That is the big question here. We’ve seen Australians familiarising themselves with independent rating tools and learning to use them when looking for credible construction firms and building professionals. One in three of those with property plans is aware of the tools which is a testament to Australians’ increasing education and due diligence” says Walters.

While a third of Australians with property plans for the next five years have a negative perception of the construction industry nearly three in ten (28%) of this group admit that their perception has improved in the past 12 months. For those consumers aware of the Independent Construction Industry Rating Tool (iCIRT) developed by Equifax the chance of an improved perception of the construction industry in the past 12 months increases to 76%.

“The correlation between the awareness of independent rating tools and change in perception of the construction industry is tangible” comments Walters. “It is understandable that consumers have construction and property concerns but rating tools like iCIRT help provide them peace of mind.”

The iCIRT star-rating system gives developers builders building and design practitioners certifiers trade contractors and consultants a rating of between 1 and 5 stars with businesses that obtain 3 gold stars and above classified as trustworthy. This gives consumers transparency and visibility allowing them to choose building professionals confidently.

York University’s Lassonde Engineering School has launched its first digital technologies work-integrated degree program. Over the course of four years students will be fully employed by the same employer earning a salary while studying towards a bachelor of applied science degree. The Fall 2023 cohort of 17 students enrolled in the pilot program will spend approximately 80 per cent of their work hours on the job with 20 per cent dedicated to academic study delivered during five-day block periods every five to seven weeks.

The program was designed in partnership with Manchester Metropolitan University which has thousands of students completing a similar work-integrated learning model that has been successfully adopted throughout the U.K. One of the model’s advantages is how it can increase access to education for a wider spectrum of students such as first-generation students students from equity-deserving groups and lifelong learners according to Richard Hornsey York’s associate dean academic and students. “[Lassonde is] starting to look at less traditional learners who may face financial barriers to university” he said. Manchester Met initially launched the model in 2015 and according to its 2021 impact report 40 per cent of its 2300 learners during that time were the first in their family to attend university while nearly 20 per cent came from “disadvantaged communities including Black Asian and minority ethnic learners.”

While York’s first cohort consists of a significantly smaller sample size Dr. Hornsey said it is near gender parity – the highest of any of the university’s STEM programs. As the program expands he hopes it will help address the significant underrepresentation of women in Canada’s technology sector. While women comprise almost half of the Canadian work force only 24 per cent of tech workers across Canada are women – a number that has only increased by two per cent over the last two decades.

Programs like the one at York could also help with Canada’s tech labour shortage. According to Equinix’s Global Tech Trends Survey 70 per cent of Canadian information technology companies view a shortage of personnel with IT skills as a main threat to their businesses. The university worked with senior technology experts from 15 businesses companies public sector organizations and industry associations who advised on a set of “occupational standards” to determine what an “ideal graduate” would look like said Dr. Hornsey. The businesses include homegrown unicorn Shopify Toronto-based data solutions company Cinchy and American and international subsidiaries such as EY Canada General Motors Canada and IBM Canada. “[The group’s] direct influence on the coursework is not very high” said Dr. Hornsey. “[They] were more focused on the goals of the program.”

Admission to the program involves a two-step process. Students first applied for the digital technologies degree the same way they would for any other Ontario university program. Once their application was processed they were given access to a job board with postings from York’s employment partners. After they pass the interview process and are given an offer of employment they receive a full offer of admission from the university. Sienna Markham a 17-year-old student from Oakville said she was delighted to be accepted into the program after only recently deciding to pursue a career in computer science. After completing five interviews with American cloud software company Ceridian she was offered a position as a product security analyst. “I’m actually the youngest person in the program so [the interview process] was pretty nerve-wracking” she said. Sienna now works 37.5 hours a week for Ceridian mostly from home and says her employer allows her the flexibility to be able to complete her coursework each Friday. While the workload is a lot to manage she believes it will be worthwhile if she graduates with a professional network and ample experience in cybersecurity. “I’m already getting hands-on experience in my field instead of working through a four-year program before you start that – you’re starting now” she said. “It’s an amazing opportunity.”

Despite the program’s potential benefits its high concentration of time in the workplace is “unusual in the university space” said Judene Pretti a senior advisor at the University of Waterloo’s Work-Learn Institute. But she points out it’s important for universities to experiment with different work-integrated learning formulas because there is limited research on how program outcomes might be affected differently according to the percentage of time students spend working versus studying. “The most important thing is that academic institutions work closely with students and employers to balance their needs” said Dr. Pretti who is also the chair of the research committee at the national work-integrated learning organization CEWIL Canada. “No one program is going to do it for all students or all employers.”

In 2020 the Ontario provincial government introduced new strategic mandate agreements for universities and colleges that receive provincial funding but were delayed for three years due to the pandemic. The 2020-2025 agreements support the government’s controversial performance-based funding model which ties provincial funding to “student and economic outcomes” that are measured by 10 metrics such as graduate employment rates graduate earnings and an institution’s local economic impact. The province expects to fully implement the new mechanism in 2024-2025 and anticipates that 25 per cent of funding will be tied to these metrics. Critics say that the shift limits the meaning of “performance” to labour-market industry and economic outcomes and underscores how the essential purpose of universities is changing. Dr. Pretti however disagrees holds particularly as it relates to work-integrated learning programs.

“Research suggests that work-integrated learning programs are equipping students in ways much beyond being ready for a particular job” she said with competencies such as intercultural effectiveness an innovation mindset navigating various communication settings and problem-solving. Such characteristics she noted are “appealing to governments who want to know that we’re investing in programs that are going to help with labour market outcomes. But seeing it only as that is missing the bigger picture and the sentiment with which they are being built.”

York hopes to expand the program next year and eventually open it up to both international and domestic students said Dr. Hornsey. At the same time the university is planning to increase the amount of experiential learning opportunities in other programs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vaW52ZXN0aW5nL21hcmtldHMvaW5zaWRlLXRoZS1tYXJrZXQvYXJ0aWNsZS1iaWctY2hhbmdlcy10by1iZXN0LW9mLWJtby10b3AtYW5hbHlzdC1zdG9jay1waWNrcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Big changes to 'Best of BMO' top analyst stock picks,"Daily roundup of research and analysis from The Globe and Mail’s market strategist Scott Barlow

The Goldman Sachs Briefings report summarizing the high priority research at the firm expressed concern over China’s property sector

“The road to recovery for China’s property sector is expected to span multiple years as China still faces the lingering aftermath of one of the largest recorded debt booms explains Goldman Sachs Research’s Kenneth Ho Asia credit strategist … Ho doesn’t expect the leverage to result in a financial crisis as past housing crises have done in other countries. “Policymakers in China [are] very focused on making sure systemic risks don’t emerge” Ho says ... The impact of the downturn is far-reaching. ‘When you have this large segment of the economy contracting — and it’s going to take years to get back to normal — your potential growth takes a big hit’ says Goldman Sachs Research’s Hui Shan chief China economist who estimates China’s potential growth at around 4%. The property downturn will also hit commodity markets. “Before the downturn Chinese copper demand just in the property sector was even more than the entire copper demand from the US” Hui notes”.

HSBC analysts Phani Kanumuri Madhvendra Singh and Davey Jose published a compelling argument for investment in data center stocks particularly Equinix

“The data center market could grow at 15% per annum through 2030 driven by demand for higher storage and computing needs as AI cloud adoption digital transformation and regulations such as data localization provide long-term tailwinds.

In a separate BMO report senior economist Robert Kavcic detailed the decline in Canadian household balance sheets

“Canadian real GDP growth has now slowed to 0.5% year-over-year and with the population exploding by 3% over that period real per-capita output is down a recession-like 2.5%. That’s overall economic output per person. But another view looks at real household disposable income per capita and the results aren’t encouraging there either. While incomes got a temporary boost during the pandemic and much of that is still on the balance sheet per-capita disposable income after inflation continues to fall. In level terms it’s now about back in-line with the pre-COVID bonanza. So temporary boost aside this measure has slowed to just a 0.3% annualized crawl over the past decade and the only weaker period was the mean days of the mid-1990s. Aside from a pop in Q1 real household consumption has now crawled at less than 0.7% annualized in four of the past five quarters—and that’s not population adjusted”

However the Mining Technology Report 2023-24 also ascertains that mining leaders are less optimistic about the immediate future due to ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic concerns.

The new paper published by digital infrastructure company Equinix revealed that miners have identified that technology will play an increasing role in achieving a digital competitive advantage meeting evolving safety and compliance standards.

ESG analytics operational technology security controls and digital twin investments are all viewed favourably.

Challenges abound

“Australian mining leaders have much to contend with right now. But equally the sector is expected to grow rapidly as the need for critical minerals reaches an inflection point” Equinix Australia managing director Guy Danskine said.

“To capitalise on this opportunity mining leaders know they need to strengthen their infrastructure and digital capabilities to connect and power a global ecosystem of people devices and the millions of terabytes of data being generated by advanced technologies.”

“While priorities may be changing ensuring investment in the right technologies is critical in overcoming operational risks rising costs and skills shortage” he added.

The Australian Mining Technology Report 2023-24 was compiled following interviews with mining executives at several companies and industry representatives across the resources sector.

Australia well-positioned

The survey found that Australia is in the enviable position of having many of the critical minerals needed to move towards a renewable future such as lithium copper zinc and vanadium.

Furthermore the United States’ Inflation Reduction Act has dramatically shifted investment towards countries with free trade agreements including Australia.

Natalie Taylor president of the WA (Western Australia) Mining Club said that despite the recent global economic downturn the Australian mining sector has reasons for optimism.

“Western Australia continues to attract strong investments and overseas interest while the energy transition is driving demand for metals and minerals” she said.

“To increase productivity and reduce risks miners are prioritising advanced wireless communication technologies real-time location system sensors and tags and automation systems. However attracting and retaining skilled workers remains the primary challenge for the mining industry to fully adopt these technologies.”

Skills pipeline needed

However the paper found that there is pressure to build a skills pipeline necessary for the sustainable future.

Nicole Roocke chief executive officer at the Mineral Research Institute of Western Australia says miners have a number of issues to consider in an ever-evolving landscape.

“The demand for commodities is soaring as global economies race to deploy clean energy technologies and the mining industry is well aware of the paradox staring it in the face: on the one hand supplying the commodities to sustain the current appetite for decarbonisation will see it scaling up significantly” Ms Roocke said.

“Conversely it needs to work very hard to adhere to the tough ESG standards being put before it. The deployment of new technology is the big challenge for brownfields operations due to the significant amount of sunk capital in infrastructure. For greenfield operations which demand deployment of emerging technologies they will face challenges in trying to secure capital and establish next-generation operations.”",,,

Despite recent economic challenges the wish to own a home remains strong. But according to a recent survey by Bankrate while nearly three-fourths of Americans identify homeownership as a major part of the American dream a majority of respondents who are not homeowners said they can’t afford to buy a home. For those who can afford it tax implications may influence their purchasing decision.

This article examines how and to what extent the mortgage interest deduction incentivizes homeownership. Of particular focus is the current temporarily lower limitation on the maximum amount of home acquisition indebtedness for purposes of the deduction and its potential effects. This lower limit applies to acquisition indebtedness incurred after Dec. 15 2017 with respect to tax years beginning after Dec. 31 2017 and before Jan. 1 2026 a change enacted by the law known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) P.L. 115-97. The TCJA also prohibits deducting interest from home equity debt for the same tax years. In fact most TCJA provisions pertaining to individual taxpayers are temporary and scheduled to sunset on Dec. 31 2025.

EFFECTS OF THE TCJA

The Sec. 163(h)(3) mortgage interest deduction has a long history. When the Tax Reform Act of 1986 P.L. 99-514 eliminated personal interest deductions the mortgage interest deduction remained with a $1 million ceiling on home acquisition indebtedness ($500000 for married couples filing separately) on a qualified residence for which interest may be considered qualified residence interest and thus potentially deductible (Secs. 163(h) (3)(A)(i) and (B)(ii)). For this purpose a qualified residence is the taxpayer’s principal residence and one other residence selected by the taxpayer that is used as a residence under the vacation home rental rules (Sec. 163(h)(4)(A)(i)). There the ceiling on acquisition indebtedness remained the same until the passage of the TCJA. Also prior to the TCJA Secs. 163(h)(3)(A)(ii) and (C) allowed an additional deduction for interest paid on up to $100000 in home equity indebtedness.

The TCJA reduced the acquisition indebtedness ceiling to $750000 ($375000 for married couples filing separately) and eliminated any interest deduction for home equity indebtedness (Sec. 163(h)(3)(F)(i) as amended by Section 11043(a) of the TCJA).

Again these changes apply only to acquisition indebtedness incurred in tax years 2018 through 2025. Acquisition indebtedness incurred before the date of the TCJA’s enactment Dec. 15 2017 (or pursuant to a written binding contract entered into before that date) remains subject to the higher limitations. Likewise for tax years after Dec. 31 2025 the higher limitation on acquisition indebtedness and the allowance of home equity indebtedness will again apply “without regard to the taxable year in which the indebtedness was incurred” (Sec. 163(h)(3)(F)(ii)).

However Congress could decide to extend or make permanent some or all of the changes to the home acquisition indebtedness rules by passing legislation to revise these changes or their scheduled sunset dates. Taxpayers considering the effects of entering into home acquisition debt before 2026 should account for this possibility.

Other changes introduced by the TCJA in effect during the period also could affect how much of a tax benefit taxpayers may derive from home mortgage interest and certain other homeownership expenses. These include the increase of the standard deduction (because it makes it less likely taxpayers will gain a tax benefit from claiming itemized deductions of which qualified residence interest is one) lower marginal tax rates and a $10000 ceiling on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction (Sec. 164(b) (6)(B)). This latter reduction in tax benefit is notable mostly for taxpayers residing in areas with higher-value real estate and higher SALT burdens. For a summary of these changes see the table “TCJA Changes Potentially Affecting a Mortgage Interest Deduction” below.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hdHRvbWRhdGEuY29tL25ld3MvbWFya2V0LXRyZW5kcy9maWd1cmVzZnJpZGF5L3RvcC0xMC11LXMtbWV0cm9zLXdpdGgtaGlnaGVzdC1kb3duLXBheW1lbnQtcGVyY2VudC1mb3ItaG9tZS1wdXJjaGFzZXMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 U.S. Metros with Highest Down Payment Percent for Home Purchases,"According to ATTOM’s Q3 2023 U.S. Residential Property Mortgage Origination Report 1.54 million mortgages secured by residential property were issued in the U.S. in Q3 2023 representing a 3 percent decline from the prior three-month period. The report noted that drop-off marked the ninth decline in the last 10 quarters – a string broken only by a spike during the second quarter of this year.

ATTOM’s latest analysis found that the third-quarter downturn which came amid increases in mortgage rates and home prices left total residential lending activity down 26 percent from a year earlier and 63 percent from a high point hit in 2021.

The newly released Q3 2023 mortgage origination report also found that lending activity resumed its extended downturn with a mix of gains and losses in major categories of residential lending as growth in refinance activity was more than offset by drops in purchase and home-equity lending.

Also according to the report the number of refinanced loans increased 5 percent quarterly to roughly 516500 while lending to home buyers went down 7 percent to about 752000 and home-equity credit lines also dipped 7 percent to 272000.

ATTOM’s third-quarter mortgage origination analysis reported that while the median single-family home loan saw a slight decrease nationwide the typical down payment percentage for home purchases increased.

The report stated that among homes purchased with financing in Q3 2023 the median loan amount was $319500. That figure was down 0.9 percent from $322500 in the prior quarter although still up annually by 1.1 percent from $316000.

According to the report the median down payment of $35050 on single-family homes and condos purchased with financing in Q3 2023 was up 12.2 percent from $31250 in Q2 2023. The report noted that with home prices rising at a smaller pace around the country the typical down payment increased as a percentage of the median purchase price. That represented 9.2 percent of the median price in the third quarter of 2023 which was up from 8.2 percent in the prior quarter and about the same as the 9.3 percent level from a year earlier.

In this post we take a deep data dive into the data behind the latest ATTOM mortgage origination report to uncover the top 10 U.S. metros with the highest median down payment percentage for home purchases.

Those metros include: San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara CA (26.2 median down payment percent of median home price); San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles-Arroyo Grande CA (24.9 percent); San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward CA (24.5 percent); Boulder CO (23.8 percent); Naples-Immokalee-Marco Island FL (22.7 percent); Barnstable Town MA (22.4 percent); Santa Rosa CA (22.3 percent); Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Beaufort SC (21.8 percent); Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura CA (21.6 percent); and Bellingham WA (21.5 percent).

Originally built in the 1950s developer Urban Investment Partners acquired a leasehold interest in the land under the property in February 2020 taking over the income generated from it from Howard University.

The historically Black university had been looking to renovate the property at 654 Girard Street NW for more than two decades. It will use $8.8 million of the funds to re-acquire the site and $22.5 million for the improvements required to convert the apartments into affordable housing available to the broader community.

“Quality housing is a fundamental human need yet far too many adults face challenges as they navigate the pathway to affordable housing for themselves and their families” Ben Vinson president of Howard University said during a press conference announcing the loan.

The financing helps Howard University’s goal of creating affordable housing in the Columbia Heights and Howard neighborhood submarkets. In fact in 2017 the university promised District leadership that it would deliver between 50 to 100 affordable units for households earning up to 60 percent of the area median income (AMI) which is currently $142300 for a household of four.

With Howard Manor’s 80 units available to those earning 60 percent or less of AMI it will fill that commitment.

“Affordable housing is a critical component of a more equitable D.C.” Mayor Muriel Bowser said Friday during the announcement. “Howard University delivering on its promise to bring more affordable units to the District reflects how our local universities are not only places to learn but also real partners in our communities.”

Since 2021 the Amazon Housing Equity Fund has provided more than $1.7 billion to create or preserve more than 14000 affordable homes including more than $1 billion for 7300 affordable homes in the D.C. region.

“Through this partnership the preservation of Howard Manor is a unique opportunity for both organizations to expand that community impact and increase the affordable housing stock in Washington D.C.” Senthil Sankaran managing principal of the Amazon Housing Equity Fund said in a prepared statement.

Requests for comment from Amazon and Howard University were not immediately returned.

December 1 2023 /CSRwire/ - In recognition of World AIDS Day on December 1 M·A·C Cosmetics invites its global community to join the fight to end HIV/AIDS by getting the lipstick that gives back 100% to charities helping people impacted by the epidemic.

Funds raised from M·A·C VIVA GLAM lipsticks directly support charities around the world working to reduce new infections and help people currently living with HIV/AIDS including God’s Love We Deliver Grassroots Soccer Positive East Waverly Care and others.

To encourage people to get tested and know their HIV status M·A·C is teaming up with Community Healthcare Network to host free and confidential rapid HIV testing on World AIDS Day outside the MAC SoHo store in New York City. M·A·C Cosmetics UK & Ireland also served as a Platinum Sponsor for this year’s Red Run in London helping to raise over £230K+ for local HIV charities and employees in New York volunteered to prepare meals at God’s Love We Deliver.

“Giving back to our community has always been core to our brand DNA and we are proud of the incredible strides M·A·C VIVA GLAM has made in helping people affected by HIV/AIDS over the past three decades. However there are still millions of people around the world still in need of our support” says Aïda Moudachirous-Rébois Global Chief Marketing Officer M·A·C Cosmetics. “This World AIDS Day serves as another key moment to rally our community around our mission of creating an AIDS-free generation.”

VIVA GLAM was started in 1994 by M·A·C founders Frank Toskan and the late Frank Angelo who saw the HIV/AIDS epidemic directly affecting their community in Toronto. They created M·A·C VIVA GLAM Lipsticks which donated 100% of the selling price to organizations serving people impacted by HIV/AIDS. Thanks to this powerful mission nearly 30 years later VIVA GLAM has raised more than $520 million USD (and counting).

“I am so proud to work for a brand like M·A·C who truly puts their money where their mouth is” says Dominic Skinner M·A·C Director of Makeup Artistry and Patron of VIVA GLAM charity Positive East. “M·A·C VIVA GLAM inspires me every day and reminds me that I work for a brand that is truly changing the world one lipstick at a time.”

While great progress has been made over the past several decades in reducing AIDS-related deaths and new HIV infections the fight is far from over. More than 39 million people around the world are currently living with HIV which continues to disproportionately impact certain populations --particularly young women and adolescent girls gay and bisexual men transgender women and racial and ethnic minorities.

This World AIDS Day put your money where your mouth is by purchasing a M·A·C VIVA GLAM lipstick at a local M·A·C location or online: https://www.maccosmetics.com/vivaglam

The campaign first launched in Germany in June 2019 and has expanded to Austria Slovakia and the Czech Republic.

Building on the success of the June 2019 German campaign that saw 100+ companies sign a declaration committing to end workplace discrimination against employees living with HIV IBM & SAP worked together with the Human Rights Campaign Foundation to extend the #workingpositively global campaign to the U.S. in 2020. Nearly four years later we have seen continued commitment from our numerous corporate members.

Today discrimination against people living with and impacted by HIV persists. Fear stigma and basic misinformation remain at the root of much of this discrimination driving exclusions from private and public sector employment opportunities. Inclusive employers know that creating welcoming workplaces across a wide spectrum of workforce diversity is not only good business practice but the right thing to do. Employers that create welcoming workplaces for employees living with HIV stand to benefit in workforce recruitment and retention as well as improve employee engagement and productivity.

EAST FREETOWN Mass. Dec. 1 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Founded in 1976 by Bob and Barbara Sanderson who have been credited as pioneers of the U.S. commercial sprouting industry and now headed by niece Elizabeth Reilley Jonathan Sprouts Inc announced the acquisition of Pennsylvania-based The Sproutman today. All produce grown and distributed by The Sproutman will be rebranded as Jonathan Spouts and the procurement now makes Jonathan Sprouts available from the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest throughout the Northeast U.S. As of December 1 2023 Jonathan Sprouts will provide The Sproutman's accounts with the same high-quality produce and service they have come to rely on.

Jonathan Sprouts

Elizabeth Reilley and cousin Rich Wolfe took the reins of the multi-generational organic sprout farming operation in August 2021. Despite the unexpected passing of Wolfe 55 (February 2022) Reilley has carried on to grow the company. Jonathan Sprout's farming headquarters will remain in Rochester and East Freetown Massachusetts.

""The organic green sprout sector has always been relatively small"" commented Elizabeth Reilley CEO of Jonathan Sprouts and Convention Committee member of the International Sprout Growers Association (an organization dedicated to strengthening the U.S. and global sprout markets) ""but the added struggles brought on by the pandemic culled it down further. When The Sproutman's founder Murray Tizer informed me of his plans to retire after three decades of supplying sprouts to the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions we both felt it was essential to keep one of the earth's most nutritional foods available to all retailers without interruption. We are grateful to Mr. Tizer for his contributions to the American sprouting industry and wish him a well-deserved and happy retirement.""

Jonathan Sprouts CEO Elizabeth Reilley began work in the family business in the 1980's while still in high school. Before returning to Jonathan Sprouts in 2007 she developed her own career in Sales and Marketing where she served as the National Sales Manager for Guess Jeans and Danskin and provided PR for The Estee Lauder Companies.

About: Jonathan Sprouts Inc. founded in 1976 by pioneers of the commercial sprout growing industry has become one of the most venerable and now the largest grower of green sprouts in the U.S. The USDA Organic Army Kosher and GSFI / SQF-certified produce can be found in most major grocers and food service distributors throughout the Northeast including Whole Foods Stop and Shop Giant Market Basket Hanaford Brothers Price Chopper Shop Right Four Seasons Produce Albert's Organics Sysco Fresh Point and Baldor.

A Teesside woman has given a comeback to crochet - with her cool new Etsy marketplace business selling quirky designs.

Bethany Green a 20-year-old apprentice lab technician from Guisborough now shares her love of crochet through social media and sells her designs on Etsy – the online marketplace focused on handmade or vintage items and craft supplies. Crochet is the process of creating textiles by using a crochet hook to interlock loops of yarn thread or strands of other materials.

Her unusual love for the art form was inspired by her grandma who used to crochet hats for her and her younger sister. Bethany’s grandma bought her some yarn and a book with simple patterns to get her started.

Bethany said: ""When people think of crochet they think of old grandmas but I see more and more younger people creating amazing stuff and it’s nice to see it becoming more of a trend. I find it very therapeutic. I can sit and do it for hours without getting bored and I find it relaxes me after a long day.""

In 2022 Bethany began studying Mathematical Physics at the University of Nottingham before leaving to pursue her career as a lab technician at Boulby Mine. In between this her interest in crochet grew and she set up an Instagram account dedicated to sharing her crochet skills.

(Image: Bethany Green)

Bethany attended St Paulinus Primary School in Guisborough where her interest for art originally stemmed from. She started painting even personalising clothes with her artwork during her time at Prior Pursglove College in the town.

EG,Everest Re,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zdXJhbmNlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjMxMjAxL05FV1MwNi85MTIzNjExNzMvUmVpbnN1cmFuY2UtYnV5ZXJzLWV5ZS1tb3JlLW9yZGVybHktcmVuZXdhbHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Reinsurance buyers eye more orderly renewals,"BOSTON — Jan. 1 2024 reinsurance renewals look set to be less contentious and economically painful for cedents than last year with ample property and property catastrophe capacity available but coverage is still expected to come at a higher price.

Reinsurers will likely continue to seek rate increases on most accounts but demand should be met and some additional property capacity may return to the market sources said during meetings at the American Property Casualty Insurance Association annual meeting in Boston last month. The event is a key reinsurance renewal meeting for the U.S. market.

Clouds may be forming over the casualty sector though as experts point to concerns over loss development but there has not been any substantial capacity pullback they said (see related story below).

“There is sufficient capacity in the property market. We don’t yet see prices coming down but we also don’t see the kind of meteoric rise (in rates) that we saw especially in calendar year 2022” said Pete Chandler San Francisco-based president and CEO of BMS Re North America a unit of brokerage BMS Group Ltd.

Property reinsurance pricing should rise but not as sharply as last year partly due to better communications between buyers sellers and brokers said John Welch Stamford Connecticut-based chief underwriting officer for Aspen Re the reinsurance unit of Aspen Insurance Holdings Ltd.

“Expectations have been set on both sides. I think pricing will go up but clearly not to the extent it did last year” he said. Some cedents with loss histories will likely “need to pay more” he said.

At Jan. 1 2023 renewals brokers and reinsurers reported rate hikes of between 40% and 100% for North American property exposures.

Aspen Re plans to offer additional property catastrophe capacity at Jan. 1 reinsurance renewals according to Mr. Welch. “We will probably deploy some more capacity — not significantly more just a little more in the property space” he said.

Brokers are helping to manage cedents’ expectations for renewals said Sharry Tibbitt Warren New Jersey-based global head of property and deputy chief underwriting officer of the reinsurance division at Everest Group Ltd.

“It seems like everybody’s expectations are aligned to some degree. Certainly the brokers are helping to prepare their clients a lot better. I think people were not prepared whatsoever last January” she said.

“Buyers a year ago didn’t know what to expect” said Justin Lorence Minneapolis-based senior broker and co-head of property for Lockton Re a unit of Lockton Cos. LLP.

This year-end renewal season should be less tumultuous. Over the past year each successive reinsurance renewal at April 1 June 1 and July 1 was “incrementally more orderly than the prior” and there was a “relatively stable supply” of capacity Mr. Lorence said.

Still property reinsurance prices are likely to rise again at Jan. 1 Ms. Tibbett said.

“I think you will have to pay more than you want to pay. I think that’s the bottom line right now” she said.

The increases though are now being properly budgeted for. “As the year went on people understood the expectations and budgeted properly. In April May June July while we were still getting rate increases that were needed and restructuring as needed they were able to get it done because they understood how to budget” Ms. Tibbett said.

“There’s likely capacity at the right price” said Matt Junge Schaumburg Illinois-based head of property underwriting U.S. for Swiss Re Ltd.

“The market will be orderly this year” said Monica Ningen Armonk New York-based CEO of U.S. property and casualty reinsurance for Swiss Re Ltd. “Prices still need to continue to go up when it comes to property catastrophe exposure but not the big price increases that we saw last year.”

Attachment points for reinsurance programs though are likely to remain at the elevated levels set last year said Jeff Fleming partner and senior reinsurance broker for Lockton Re in New York.

“Attachment points rose quite significantly last year” and do not appear to be going back down he said. “Markets were looking to make changes.”





Casualty reinsurance concerns raised as reserves come under scrutiny

Skyrocketing property catastrophe rates dominated commercial reinsurance year-end renewals last year but this year discussions over casualty rates are expected to have more prominence.

Talk is now turning to potential challenges in the casualty markets including possible increases in loss frequency and severity trends and concerns about the adequacy of reserves.

“The loss development on the casualty side is concerning a lot of people” said Sharry Tibbitt Warren New Jersey-based global head of property and deputy chief underwriting officer of the reinsurance division at Everest Group Ltd. Executives speaking on recent third-quarter earnings calls raised the issue she said adding “It’s something we’re keeping our eye on.”

Casualty concerns became apparent during the Insurance Leadership Forum in Colorado Springs Colorado in October said Monica Ningen Armonk New York-based CEO of U.S. property and casualty reinsurance for Swiss Re Ltd.

“The primary carriers are talking about casualty business. They’re talking about the uncertainty that they see and whether or not it can make money going forward without additional rates there” she said.

Pete Chandler San Francisco-based president and CEO of BMS Re North America a unit of brokerage BMS Group Ltd. said he began hearing concerns about casualty market reinsurance challenges at the Rendez-Vous de Septembre meeting in Monte Carlo Monaco which serves as the unofficial kickoff of year-end reinsurance renewals.

“The conversation started to pivot from property to casualty at Monte Carlo” Mr. Chandler said. “We are hearing of some increases in reserve development.”

There has not been any meaningful withdrawal of capacity from the casualty reinsurance market however said Doug May Seattle-based president of Gallagher Re North America the reinsurance brokerage unit of Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.

“At the end of the day reinsurance is about supply and demand so if there’s no big departures in terms of capacity for casualty placements we would expect a renewal which is a version of the previous few renewals. That being said there could be pressure if an individual portfolio has some loss development” Mr. May said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZm9zeXMuY29tL25ld3Nyb29tL2V2ZW50cy8yMDIzL2F3cy1yZS1pbnZlbnQtMjAyMy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Infosys at AWS re:Invent 2023,"AI Amplified - Becoming a Cloud-first AI-first Enterprise with Infosys

They were anchored to the north face of Mount Jannu one of the world’s biggest sheerest rock walls.

The void below them was 10000 feet of thin black air. Above them within reach was something most people can only imagine.

“I know we still have a lot to do” Alan Rousseau said to his two fellow climbers. “But I feel like we just did something cool.”

The next day Rousseau Matt Cornell and Jackson Marvell — little known outside of climbing circles for the moment — stood at Jannu’s summit. Before them were the white tips of other major peaks including Everest and Kangchenjunga."

Initial Notice Mailed to all Electric Customers - December 2023



Frequently Asked Questions

What is the Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) Project?

The AMI project is a technological upgrade of all the electric revenue meters in Wellesley. This project involves installing new electric meters at all residences and businesses. The new equipment will allow us to provide improved service operational savings and better energy usage / billing information.



What is an AMI meter?

AMI stands for Advanced Meter Infrastructure. AMI meter technology has existed for decades and is the most efficient and effective method for collecting and transmitting usage data and detecting service interruptions. AMI meters are digital electric meters equipped with wireless communication technology.

AMI will allow the WMLP to remotely read your electric meter data without having to drive by or access your property each month. The AMI meters will transmit your usage data remotely and automatically over a private secure radio frequency (RF) network to the WMLP. AMI can also more readily detect power outages and send alerts which will improve restoration times. Customers will also have the ability to access and review their electric usage on a web-based customer portal.



Why is the WMLP installing AMI meters?

Our existing meters are past their useful life and need to be replaced. The WMLP last replaced them in 1999. Since then AMI meters have become the standard for utilities around the country because they allow for more efficient collection of meter readings and improved service particularly in the event of an outage. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration about 73% of total residential electric meters in the U.S. are AMI. National Grid and Eversource will begin to deploy AMI meters throughout their service territories in MA in 2024 and 2025 respectively.



How does AMI benefit me?

Using the customer portal you will have the ability to monitor your electric usage at a more timely and granular basis and therefore be able to save energy and manage costs more effectively. This data will also help us better address your questions and any issues you may have with your usage or an outage condition. In the future AMI could provide customers additional opportunities to reduce their usage and electric bills more dynamically through high usage alerts demand management/response programs and time-varying rates particularly as more electric vehicles and heat pumps are adopted. These opportunities would serve as an important element towards achieving the Town’s goal for greenhouse gas emission reductions.



Will I still need to call when my power is out?

AMI meters will automatically and remotely report the location of outages but please don’t hesitate to call us particularly if you can provide us any information regarding the cause e.g. fallen tree or limb.

Will this meter replacement cost me anything?

No there is no charge for the AMI meter and its installation. There will be no additional customer bill charges for this new technology.



When and who will replace my meter?

WMLP employees will be installing the new meters starting in December 2023. All installers will have a photo ID badge and drive clearly marked vehicles. Upon arrival they will ring the doorbell at or knock on your front door prior to locating and replacing your existing meter.

If we cannot safely access your electric meter or it is located inside your home or business the WMLP will leave a door hanger and need to schedule an appointment with you for the installation. For inside installation an adult (18 years old minimum) must be present. The area around the electric meter must be accessible to the installer.

How long will it take to replace my meter?

The installation will take approximately 20 minutes.

Will my service be interrupted during installation?

Replacement will require a brief power outage that typically lasts less than one minute. We sincerely apologize for this short disruption in your electric service.

How will I know that my meter has been changed?

We will leave a door hanger indicating that we have replaced your meter.

Does the radio frequency (RF) from AMI pose a health risk?

AMI meters will not negatively affect your health. The RF emitted by these meters is intermittent and well below the limits set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). They represent no known health hazards and emit significantly lower exposure levels than most other typical devices that emit RF such as cell phones wireless routers baby monitors and microwave ovens.

Will the AMI communication system interfere with my home business or medical devices?

AMI meters do not adversely affect the stability or performance of home wireless networks. The radio transmissions operate in compliance with FCC Regulations to avoid interference with other electronic devices.

Will my account and usage information remain confidential?

Data collected and transmitted by AMI meters is protected by multiple layers of security to guard against unauthorized actions breaches and tampering. Meters and the associated communications system are encrypted and equipped with security features to prevent unauthorized access.

Will WMLP be able to control anything in my house?

No the WMLP’s access stops at the AMI meter.

Will the WMLP be able to tell what I am doing in the privacy of my home?

No AMI meters collect and transmit only energy use data.

Will my new AMI meter make my bills higher?

No AMI meters measure and record electric usage in exactly the same way as our existing meters. They will not cause your usage to increase or decrease. AMI meters have been tested under various conditions and show consistently accurate readings.

How will I know that you have my reading and not someone else’s?

Each AMI meter has a unique identifier number associated with your customer account that will be transmitted along with the meter reading.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdXJhbnQuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMDIva2V2aW4tcmVubmllLWFuLXVnbHktcG9saXRpY2FsLXdyZWNrLWluLWNvbm5lY3RpY3V0LXRoYXQtY291bGQtaGF2ZS1iZWVuLWF2b2lkZWQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kevin Rennie: An ugly political wreck in Connecticut that could have been avoided,Kevin Rennie: An ugly political wreck in Connecticut that could have been avoided,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRheS5jb20vbG9jYWwtbmV3cy8yMDIzMTIwMS90aGF0LW1ha2VzLXRocmVlLWFzLW1vcmUtY29tcG9uZW50cy1oZWFkLXRvLXNvdXRoLWZvcmstd2luZC1mYXJtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,That makes three as more components head to South Fork Wind farm,"Wind turbine components for the third turbine leaves New London Friday Dec. 1. 2023 for the South Fork Wind project.

New London ― Components for a third wind turbine under construction at the South Fork Wind Farm departed from State Pier Friday morning.

The components will become part of Danish wind company Ørsted’s and Eversource’s 12-turbine wind farm located in waters 35 miles off the coast of Montauk Point in New York.

South Fork Wind is the first of three projects expected to be staged at State Pier. The first components bound for South Fork departed New London on October 31 though the blades were returned to New London temporarily due to a maintenance issue.

A barge with components for the second turbine departed State Pier on Nov. 23.

Officials said the 130-megawatt South Fork project will deliver energy to 70000 homes on Long Island with power expected to begin flowing to the grid before the end of the year."

MY SPACE Amazon is selling a ‘cost effective’ $520 tiny home kit in two colors & shoppers say ‘instructions were easy to follow’

AMAZON has brought the tiny home movement to any American willing to spend $520.

The retailer is selling an affordable tiny home kit in two colors which customers have praised as cost-effective and easy to assemble.

Devoko Outdoor Storage Shed $519.99 from Amazon - buy here

DEVOKO OUTDOOR STORAGE SHED

The Devoko Outdoor Storage Shed has customers convinced it's one of the most affordable options in the market.

The 10-foot by 10-foot tiny home kit accommodates ""everything you want to put away.""

Equipped ventilation openings also allow for better air circulation

It comes in grey or brown

Made of high-grade metal with waterproof and UV-resistant properties

Covered by warranty

Amazon doesn't indicate the Devoko Storage Shed as inhabitable.

But possibilities are in the hands of the builder as seen by one American who turned a tractor into a tiny home and another couple who transformed a campervan into their permanent residence.

But if you're looking for more straightforward function options reviewers have praised the Devoko Storage Shed as the extra space their home needed.

WHAT'S SO GREAT?

Americans have said there's plenty to love about the tiny home kit.

The product has a four-star rating with 127 reviews.

However some customers cautioned to level your expectations.

One person said the storage was very cost-effective.

""After thinking about buying a shed for a long time I finally decided to buy a 10x10 one. This outdoor storage shed is worth every penny.""

One person was pleased with the results but complained about the process.

""It’ll take all day - have lots of patience!""

They suggested being mindful of the weather keeping the dog in the house because your pet might ""ruin everything"" and studying the plans before commencing.

Another customer felt the instructions were ""easy to follow"" but the structure was imperfect.

""You get what you pay for.""

Devoko Outdoor Storage Shed $519.99 from Amazon - buy here

And one frustrated shopper loved the shed but will only buy pre-assembled tiny home kits moving forward.

""I'd rather pay $500.00 for the same [shed] already assembled.""

The consensus was that the shed had room for improvement but it was still a storage bang for the buck.

Some tiny home enthusiasts approach the lifestyle with the adage: If you want something done right you must do it yourself.

One couple spent $20000 to build their dream tiny home and get rid of their mortgage forever.

Another homeowner showed a tiny home he built with a full bathroom and entertainment setup for only $5000.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2Nsb3NldC10dXJuZWQtcGFudHJ5LXdpdGgtc2hvZS1zdG9yYWdlLWJpbnMtMzczNDkzMzLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,See How I Turned My Closet into a Pantry with These $1 Storage Gems,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.apartmenttherapy.com/closet-turned-pantry-with-shoe-storage-bins-37349332 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFwYXJ0bWVudHRoZXJhcHkuY29tL2Nsb3NldC10dXJuZWQtcGFudHJ5LXdpdGgtc2hvZS1zdG9yYWdlLWJpbnMtMzczNDkzMzLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3BpY2t1cC10cnVja3Mtd2l0aC1tb3N0LWNhcmdvLXNwYWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Pickup Trucks With The Most Cargo Space For 2023,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdGNhcnMuY29tL3BpY2t1cC10cnVja3Mtd2l0aC1tb3N0LWNhcmdvLXNwYWNlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbnNqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9wdXJzdWl0cy9ob21lLWxpdmluZy9kZXNpZ24tYS13ZWxjb21pbmctZ3Vlc3QtYmVkcm9vbdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Tips For Creating a Welcoming Guest Room,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.mensjournal.com/pursuits/home-living/design-a-welcoming-guest-bedroom on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1lbnNqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9wdXJzdWl0cy9ob21lLWxpdmluZy9kZXNpZ24tYS13ZWxjb21pbmctZ3Vlc3QtYmVkcm9vbdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Carbon Tracker has examined corporate alignment with climate targets transition risk incentives and corporate climate targets in other work. In this piece we focus on the economic and financial dimensions of three recent developments in the North American oil and gas space: (1) lithium extraction (2) carbon dioxide removal (CDR)/carbon capture & storage (CCS); and (3) large scale consolidation activity.

Two companies that appear to be ahead of the group in terms of these ET activities are: Occidental Petroleum (in CDR/CCS) and ExxonMobil (in CDR/CCS & lithium extraction).

The US IRA (Inflation Reduction Act of 2022) and the relentless drive toward electrification of the global passenger car fleet provide support for potentially strong returns in lithium & in CDR/CCS. While some engineering challenges remain our preliminary analysis suggests that returns for these ET businesses are very competitive with traditional oil & gas activities given the tax incentives available.

Lithium in particular could see strong tailwinds with double digit demand growth far surpassing that of oil & gas. Lithium is a cornerstone of the ET benefitting from both economics and the decarbonization impulse.

The $85/ton section 45Q IRA tax credit could generate a strong return profile for point source CCS project partners.

Though low-carbon investments remain a fraction of their overall investments we are seeing a rising rate of change in ET activities with these businesses potentially becoming a meaningful part of company portfolios in the medium term.

Also there’s large scale consolidation in the traditional oil & gas space epitomized by: (1) ExxonMobil’s $60 billion acquisition of Pioneer a Permian pure play and (2) Chevron $53 billion acquisition of Hess whose core assets are long cycle offshore Guyana Stabroek Block.

From a risk-weighted economic and financial standpoint we believe short cycle shale is less risky than long cycle conventional oil & gas developments in a declining hydrocarbon demand scenario as shale has a lower risk of becoming stranded.

We also note the importance of being the low-cost producer in the energy transition as we have stated here and here with larger oil & gas fields generally having a lower cost.

Longer term we expect industry consolidation could lead to a more limited pace of oil & gas development since there’s a tendency toward supply restraint in concentrated industries.

Located near Southampton Hampshire on England’s south coast the Fawley oil refinery stands as the largest and oldest among the six operational refinery sites in the UK. The facility processes 270000 barrels of crude per day.

ExxonMobil plans to incorporate a new hydrogen plant into Britain’s largest oil-processing complex a move that could open avenues for the development of sustainable aviation fuel. The unit is designed to operate on natural gas.

The refinery is poised to increase low-sulfur diesel production by 40%. Referred to as the Fast project it is expected to achieve full production in 2025 coinciding with the planned cessation of low-sulfur diesel production at the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland.

ExxonMobil has been working for years on the Fawley diesel facility. The company paused work on the Fawley diesel facility due to Covid-induced drop in fuel demand. In Europe diesel profits now exceed historical averages due to Russia sanctions impacting the region’s major external supplier.

Although UK diesel demand has not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels the country depends on imports for approximately half of its consumption. The Fawley project has the potential to reduce imports by up to a quarter.

The expanded facility is expected to commence production in 2024. ExxonMobil initially projected nearly 45% increase equivalent to 38000 barrels per day in ultra-low sulfur diesel production when it made the final investment decision in 2019.

Earlier this month XOM obtained funding from the UK government to investigate sustainable aviation fuel production at Fawley. If the project progresses it could meet 20% of the UK’s sustainable aviation fuel requirements by 2030.

The hydrogen plant at Fawley is set to be part of the Solent cluster a collaborative effort among companies focused on decarbonizing the industry. XOM’s significant investment aims to decrease Britain’s dependence on imported fuel and reduce emissions linked to global transport.

(FFIV) is a Must-Have Software Stock for Your Portfolio?,"F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results. The non-GAAP EPS of the company stood at $3.50 surpassing the consensus estimate of $3.21 marking an impressive 33.6% surge from $2.62 in the prior-year quarter. This performance significantly exceeds management’s forecast range of $3.15 – $3.27 per share.

The revenue during this quarter also experienced significant growth reaching $706.97 million topping the consensus estimate of $702.25 million. Despite the prevalent macroeconomic uncertainties and constrained customer budgets revenues rose by 1% year-over-year aligning with the management’s guidance range of between $690 million to $710 million.

While FFIV expects some customer caution to persist into fiscal year 2024 it remains focused on delivering earnings growth and returning cash to its shareholders. For fiscal year 2024 FFIV expects to remain committed to its profitability commitment and deliver non-GAAP EPS growth of 5% to 7% year-over-year.

Since these positive earnings announcements the company’s shares have seen significant growth and could see further upside. Hence a prospective investor might consider FFIV a promising buy. Supporting this bullish outlook are a number of key metrics outlining FFIV’s stable financial performance.

On December 31 2020 the net income was $296.59 million.

The first quarter of 2021 witnessed a slight decrease to $278.45 million by the end of March.

This was followed by another rise in the second quarter to $298.19 million by June 30 2021.

There was a noticeable increase by the end of the third quarter with a value of $331.24 million by September 30 2021.

By the end of 2021 F5 Networks’ net income rose to $337.12 million on December 31. The company saw further growth into the next year with net income reaching its peak of $350.12 million in March 2022 but this growth was not sustained.

There was a small decrease to $343.53 million by June 2022 followed by a more significant drop to $322.16 million by the end of September 2022.

By the end of 2022 the company’s net income had further decreased to $301 million by December 31.

However the beginning of 2023 showed signs of recovery with an increase to $326.2 million by March.

There was continued growth with F5 Networks having a reported net income of $332.16 million by the end of June.

Further there was a significant bounce back with the net income jumping to $394.95 million by September 30 – this was the highest figure in the reported period. Overall the F5 Networks advanced from a net income of $296.59 million at the beginning of the series to $394.95 million by the end indicating a percentage growth rate of approximately 33.17% over this period.

The trailing-12-month revenue of F5 Networks Inc. (FFIV) has seen a steady upward trend with occasional fluctuations over the given period.

On December 31 2020 the Revenue was $2.41 billion.

There seems to be regular quarterly growth with the Revenue reported at $2.6 billion by September 30 2021.

For the year-end on December 31 2022 the Revenue was $2.71 billion. This marked a slight increase from the $2.7 billion reported in September 2022.

However it’s worth mentioning that there was a minor dip in Revenue in the first quarter of the year (to $2.65 billion on March 31 2022) before rebounding back up slightly mid-year.

The trend continued to rise into 2023 with the company reporting revenues of $2.78 billion (March) $2.81 billion (June) and $2.81 billion (September) respectively.

The growth rate as measured from the first value ($2.41 billion as of December 2020) to the last ($2.81 billion as of September 2023) indicates an upward trend of approximately 16.6% for F5 Networks Inc. Revenue in the given period. This suggests a stable though not necessarily rapid growth scenario for the firm. Despite this the emphasis should be given to more recent data such as the slight stagnation of Revenue at $2.81 billion between June and September 2023. While the reasons for this are not within the data provided such details could inform the company strategizing for future Revenue growth.

The highest reached value was observed in September 2023 with a ROA of 7.6% marking a growth by approximately 19% from the first value in December 2020.

A noticeable trend is that the ROA appears to have minor dips in about every three quarters before bouncing back and exceeding previous peaks. This pattern can be seen in June 2021 March and December 2022 and finally September 2023.

In terms of recent values since the significant dip in December 2022 (5.9%) the ROA recovered and increased moderately. As of September 2023 the ROA reached 7.6% surpassing all previous values within this period.

If $246.30 is the final number for the year it will mark the highest (annual) EPS number reported by the index since FactSet began tracking this metric in 1996. However what is the likelihood that $246.30 will be the final EPS value for the S&P 500 in 2024?

In other words how accurate is the bottom-up EPS estimate for the S&P 500 one year in advance?

Over the past 25 years (1998 – 2022) the average difference between the bottom-up EPS estimate at the beginning of the year (December 31) and the final EPS number for that same year has been 6.9%. In other words industry analysts on average have overestimated the final EPS number by 6.9% one year in advance.

Analysts overestimated the final value (the final value finished below the estimate) in 17 of the 25 years and underestimated the final value (the final value finished above the estimate) in the other 8 years.

For the purposes of this analysis the final EPS number for a year is the EPS number recorded two months after the end of each calendar year (February 28) to capture the actual annual EPS results reported by most companies during the fourth quarter earnings season.

However this 6.9% average includes four years in which the difference between the bottom-up EPS estimate at the start of the year and the final EPS number for that same year exceeded 25%: 2001 (+36%) 2008 (+43%) 2009 (+28%) and 2020 (+27%). These large differences can be attributed to events that may have been difficult for analysts to predict at the start of the year. In 2001 the country endured the 9/11 attacks. In 2008 and 2009 the country was in the midst of economic recession. In 2020 economic lockdowns were implemented due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If these four years with unusual circumstances were excluded the average difference between the bottom-up EPS estimate at the start of the year and the final EPS number for that year would be 2.0%.

If one applies the average overestimation of 6.9% to the current 2024 EPS estimate (assuming the estimate changes little between now and December 31) the final value for 2024 would be $229.25. Based on current estimates this number would still reflect the highest annual EPS number reported by the index since FactSet began tracking this metric in 1996.

If one applies the average overestimation of 2.0% (excluding the years 2001 2008 2009 and 2020) to the current 2024 EPS estimate (again assuming the estimate changes little between now and December 31) the final value for 2024 would be $241.38. Based on current estimates this number would also still reflect the highest annual EPS number reported by the index since FactSet began tracking this metric in 1996.

While Iran now produces ~4% of global supply it accounts for 13% of OPEC production. From 2000 to 2018 the country’s production averaged 3.6 MMb/d but in November 2018 U.S. sanctions came back into force following a 180-day winddown period as the U.S. exited the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) under the Trump Administration. Following the JCPOA exit Iran’s crude production fell almost immediately and bottomed out in Summer 2020 at 1.9 MMb/d. However Iranian production has since resurged to 3.1 MMb/d in October 2023. In this Energy Market Insight BTU Analytics takes a closer look at three possible scenarios for future Iranian output in the face of renewed U.S. sanctions and where Iran stands with regard to OPEC.

Sanctions enforcement is a challenge. Tactics such as ship-to-ship transfers turning off tanker transponders and labeling Iranian crude as being from a different place of origin make this segment of the market rather opaque. Demand for Iranian crude has also increased as seen by export numbers which may be as high as 1.5 MMb/d. Using IEA data BTU Analytics calculates exports are closer to 1.1 MMb/d.

Three scenarios

BTU Analytics sees three potential scenarios when assessing Iran’s future output in regard to U.S. sanctions policy.

Enforcement Improves: The U.S. steps up its enforcement of existing sanctions and potentially adds more which could bring between 1–1.5 MMb/d off the market based on historical trends. This would then require increasing crude production in other countries OPEC or otherwise to balance the market. Venezuela may start to ramp up production as Chevron was approved by the U.S. government to return to the country with a potential near-term addition of under 200 Mb/d according to the EIA. U.S. production rose over 1.0 MMb/d over the last year but BTU Analytics forecasts U.S. crude production growth to slow to ~0.5 MMb/d in 2024. Saudi Arabia along with OPEC could bring more barrels to the market by decreasing the voluntary cut amounts. Enforcement for Publicity: The U.S. conducts “PR” enforcement meaning a few headlines on seized tankers but not enough to actually curb production in Iran. Seizures of tankers and pressure on importing countries e.g. China and shipping companies can disincentivize production growth in Iran but are not likely enough to prevent production from increasing. As a note when tankers are seized the oil is delivered to another country. For example the U.S. offloaded 447 Mbbls of Iranian crude in August 2023. This is noteworthy since the seized barrels are not actually taken off the market just redirected for processing somewhere other than their intended destination thus technically remaining in the global crude balance. Under this scenario Iranian crude production remains flat at 3.1 MMb/d going forward. Enforcement Lacks: If enforcement were to wane further Iran could grow production by another 0.5–1.0 MMb/d in 2024–2025 reaching 4 MMb/d which is in line with comments made by Iranian Oil Minister Javad Owji. This scenario implies almost no meaningful measures are taken by the U.S. and little is done to disincentivize Iranian offtakers from taking the sanctioned oil. As China is reportedly a top importer of Iran’s oil it may prove difficult for the U.S. to have an Impact on China’s demand for Iranian blends since non-OECD countries are taking more crude from countries on the West’s blacklist.

At present BTU Analytics expects little change to current U.S. enforcement strategy but recognizes the upside risk to the production forecast under the current status quo and potential downside risk to the oil price. Iran increasing production by 0.5–1.0 MMb/d could create issues for OPEC and its partners as well since the cartel would have to further limit production from countries under the quota system. It’s worth noting that Iran’s draft budget for 2024–‘25 calls for a decline in export volumes and production as well as lower prices for its crude which could be an indicator of increased domestic consumption. This estimated decline in exports could also be used by the U.S. to show its “stricter” sanctions enforcement is working.

Where Iran fits in OPEC

OPEC and its partners officially capped production for the remainder of 2023 at 39.7 MMb/d which is about 44% of global crude production. On November 30 2023 the group decided at the November 2023 Ordinary Meeting to adjust the 1Q24 target production from the initial guidance provided in the June 2023 Ordinary Meeting. June 2023 guidance called for OPEC+ to increase crude production 0.8 MMb/d for the entirety of 2024 but yesterday’s guidance calls for a cut of 2.2 MMb/d. When adjusting the new guidance to current production levels the prior projected growth in 2024 and Russian participation the actual cut is 0.9 MMb/d (-0.46 MMb/d OPEC -0.48 from non-OPEC). Brazil was also invited to join the non-OPEC partner group starting in 2024 but its production quotas were not yet set. Due to ongoing sanctions and economic hardship OPEC exempts Iran from the current quota system. Should sanctions enforcement be lacking and Iran allowed to increase production other OPEC+ members would need to cut production further to offset Iranian growth and maintain a balanced market.

FICO,Fair Isaac,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvdXNpbmd3aXJlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy9jcmVkaXQtcmVwb3J0cy13aWxsLWJlLW1vcmUtZXhwZW5zaXZlLWZvci1tb3J0Z2FnZS1sZW5kZXJzLWluLTIwMjQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Credit reports will be more expensive for mortgage lenders in 2024,"Mortgage originators will pay more to access consumer credit reports in 2024 reigniting complaints from mortgage lenders and trade associations.

In 2024 Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) the company that retains the rights to the market’s adopted methodology to measure consumer credit risk will charge one price – higher than the current price – to all mortgage lenders independent of their volumes. The change represents a departure from the tier-based pricing structure it implemented in early 2023.

FICO will also collect the same per score price for soft pulls and hard pulls next year an initiative that started in 2023 despite significant differences in these products.

“FICO will collect approximately $10 total for all three scores out of a $50 (or more) tri-merge report and score bundle which continues to constitute a low percentage (approximately 20% or less) of the overall cost of a tri-merge report” a spokesperson for FICO wrote in a statement to HousingWire.

For 2023 FICO said it would collect approximately $2 to $8 for all three score tiers out of a $40 to $50 (or more) tri-merge report and score bundle and out of an average $3800 in closing costs. Compared to 2022 mortgage lenders in 2023 saw a price increase between 10% and 400% mortgage trade groups and other stakeholders said.

For 2024 two mortgage executives who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation told HousingWire that they expect prices to increase by more than double in some cases. Ultimately the sources added that lenders will charge more to their borrowers who are already facing affordability challenges.

“It seems like only yesterday you could pull a single borrower tri-merge for $15 and a joint for $30” Greg Sher Managing Director of NFM Lending wrote in a LinkedIn post that went viral in the mortgage industry. “Now those prices will be in the neighborhood of $50 and $100 respectively — one well-known widely used credit reporting agency plans on charging $75/$150. For clarification purposes every IMB uses 3rd party vendors (also known as credit reporting agencies).”

Scott Olson executive director at the Community Home Lenders of America (CHLA) said that increasing prices in this difficult economic environment will “only make it difficult for borrowers to participate in the American dream.”

Soft and hard pulls

Another change for 2024 is related to the pricing structure of soft pulls which are performed to provide pre-approval letters only visible to the borrower and without impacts on credit scores. Its prices will come closer to those applied to hard pulls which are recorded on the borrower’s credit report visible to anyone and can trigger leads.

“Last year we implemented a tier-based pricing structure for mortgage originations and FICO collected the same per score wholesale price for most soft pulls as hard pulls but some lenders qualified for a lower price in certain cases for some soft pulls” the spokesperson for FICO told HousingWire.

Brendan McKay president of advocacy at the mortgage broker group Association of Independent Mortgage Experts (AIME) complained FICO doubled the cost of hard pulls at the beginning of 2023.

“Now they are charging the same amount for a soft credit pull an inherently inferior product that provides less actionable information than a hard credit pull. There has been no justification given for the increased expense.”

According to McKay the cost burden will be passed directly onto consumers and those from underserved communities will feel it most.

“Despite being a private institution FICO is currently a critical component in the mortgage process. As an industry we owe it to future homeowners to bring attention to the misuse of power” McKay said.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are moving away from the current Classic FICO credit score model requiring lenders to use two credit scores generated by the FICO Score 10 T and the VantageScore 4.0 models which are considered more inclusive than their predecessor.

Price to originators

A FICO representative said the company does not set the retail price for end users.

Ultimately “Anything above these wholesale prices charged as part of a tri-merge score and report bundle is collected and retained by others who sell and distribute the scores” the spokesperson said.

Credit bureaus which work with the FICO model may pass the FICO price increases to their clients.

TransUnion and Experian did not reply to a request for comments.

Meanwhile a spokesperson for Equifax wrote to HousingWire that beginning in January 2024 it will have a price adjustment to “reflect cost increases from third-party providers of credit reports and credit scores.”

However the spokesperson added “Equifax is sensitive to the impact these third-party cost increases may have on customers especially given current market conditions. With this in mind Equifax is not increasing the costs related to the Equifax credit file component of the tri-merge credit report for 2024.”

The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) president and CEO Bob Broeksmit said that “In light of these media reports about another round of unexplained sharp price increases we reiterate our concerns about the lack of transparency into the factors that are driving these pricing changes.”



“Given the unique market structure and limited options for obtaining credit reports and credit scores MBA urges policymakers to examine the drivers of these cost increases to ensure transparency and to protect consumers from paying higher costs in connection with their home mortgages” Broeksmit said.

The Genesis of the Affair

A strange uproar has been rising on Ghanaian social media since the country’s Vice President announced during a speech at the country’s largest university that his government will introduce a credit scoring system next year.

This revolutionary development aims to lower the perceived risk of borrowers so that Ghanaians can pick up goodies like cars with nothing more than their precious Ghana Card the much-vaunted national ID card.

Why would such a lip-smacking prospect generate any kind of furore at all? Who can be against a government policy that strips away the pointless burdens of having to prove income whenever one fancies a nice SUV provided one is blessed to be endowed with the almighty Ghana Card?

There is a small issue: Ghana has had a credit referencing system akin to that being promised since 2010. And this is not the first time a timeline has been given for this ethereal system to surface.

Old Promise

More than a year ago whilst speaking to an audience of bankers the Veep promised the launch of this magnificent system by the end of March 2023.

The Citizen App that he says will provide the doorway to accessing the new credit scoring system was launched as part of the Ghana.gov project years ago. In its latest reporting to UNCTAD under the eTrade Readiness Assessment scheme the government claimed that ~1500 state bodies and agencies have already been onboarded onto the Citizen App to provide services to the population.

Which then makes one wonder why there is a need to “introduce” the app next year to among other services offer credit scoring. Perhaps it helps knowing that the Citizen App is an important component of the Ghana Digital Acceleration Project approved for funding to the tune of $200 million by the World Bank in April 2022. When such relatively large amounts are at stake politicians tend to get creative about spending money. In this specific case however something more bizarre must be going on.

The State of Ghana’s Current Credit Scoring System

As was explained at the outset Ghana has a credit scoring system with active players trying to make the most of the situation. According to the World Bank so do at least 24 other sub-Saharan African countries.

A credit scoring system is simply a statistical representation of the likelihood of a borrower to default on a loan or other form of credit. Such a score is relied upon among other factors by a creditor to gauge the risk of extending a particular credit facility such as a car loan mortgage or postpaid phone contract. Creditors use their own internal formulas and also consult specialised entities called “credit bureaus” or “credit referencing agencies” that aggregate insights about borrowers at a scale that they on their own may not be able to do.

Ghana’s first credit bureau XDS Data was incorporated in 2003 and commenced operations in 2004.

In 2008 one year after the substantive law on credit referencing was passed Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) joined the fray. Both companies however had to wait till 2010 when the Bank of Ghana formally issued full licenses and set up the regulatory infrastructure for full-blown credit referencing in Ghana. Following this milestone promoters of the bureaus like policymakers heartily announced a new era of loans without collateral.

In March 2020 Legislative Instrument (LI) 2394 came into force to provide regulations for the conduct of credit referencing activities in Ghana. Sections 4 and 5 of these regulations impose strict obligations on data providers to update information on borrowers monthly and to ensure/assure the quality of the data provided at all times.

In essence financial institutions are not even at liberty to provide credit in Ghana without running a search in view of sections 30 and 31 of the regulations.

Besides the credit bureaus the Securities and Exchange Commission of Ghana (SEC) has also recently licensed the country’s first Credit Rating Agency Beacon. Typically rating agencies target large corporations and may rate either the corporate client itself its securities or other financial instruments issued by it or both. What this means is that Ghana now has a domestic equivalent of the well-known Fitch and Moody’s.

Beacon has so far only been able to complete one rating action in the one year since it started operating but 14 other companies are in the queue. Obviously as should be clear from the processes as outlined below Ghana Card will make no dent in this backlog.

So What “Credit Scoring” again?

Given these various obvious facts the Veep’s claim that the absence of credit scoring in Ghana is what has increased the risk-perception rating of borrowers in the eyes of creditors and thus stunted availability of credit is very strange especially in a country where the base interest rate hovers around 30% and many borrowers have to contend with rates exceeding the 40% mark.

In response to the mounting confusion the Technical Advisor of the Veep took to social media in a bid to shine more light.

His main arguments are as follows:

The current credit scoring system excludes 80% of adults.

The current system is “bank-led” and has failed to expand its data sources beyond the traditional banking system.

The proposed system will ride on the vaunted Ghana Card system giving it access to a broader range of demographic and other forms of data thereby embracing more effectively the population of the country.

The data from this new and humongous constellation will improve credit decision-making widen the net for more people to benefit from credit and modernise the Ghanaian economy.

The proposed system will make it easier for individuals to access their scores by posting them online.

These positions were more or less corroborated by a political risk analyst affiliated to the same think tank as this writer but with an interesting new twist. Whilst acknowledging the existence of a credit referencing system in Ghana the author disputed the maturity of the system to the point where it can generate individual credit scores.

In the rest of this short essay we shall explore why none of these arguments hold much water.

Does the Existing Credit-Scoring System exclude 80% of adults?

No it doesn’t.

According to the Bank of Ghana’s (BoG’s) own data nearly 8.8 million Ghanaians have credit data captured by one of the country’s credit bureaus.

Roughly half of all active companies registered in the country are also captured.

Data from the 2021 census would thus indicate an adult population coverage level of nearly 50%. Not the 20% claimed by the Technical Advisor to the Veep.

Even more importantly users report that more than 85% of the time when they attempt to query a borrower’s credit they get a hit suggesting that for the vast majority of economically active citizens who actually want credit coverage exists.

After flattening between 2016 and 2018 usage of the existing credit referencing/scoring system has increased considerably with more than 9.3 million checks being conducted by creditors annually. As well as information on more than 15 million credit transactions covered.

Of course a system that covers every adult small business and every financial transaction in the economy will be more ideal but such a system is very hard to establish anywhere in the world.

In the United States (US) arguably the most advanced credit market in the world research by the US government’s Consumer Finance Protection Bureau has revealed that roughly 22% of Americans are “invisible” to the credit referencing/scoring system due to having no credit score at all or information too scanty to compute a score.

Whilst it makes sense to keep looking for ways to ensure the coverage of every adult and small business it is essential to be clear as to how that could be achieved. The suggestion that the Ghana Card is some kind of silver bullet for killing credit invisibility is wholly unsupported since it is not a lack of civil identity that restricts individuals from engaging in reportable economic activity.

At any rate as will become obvious shortly the issue of ensuring deep and broad reporting of economic activities is very well understood but never has the use of a particular civil ID been cited as the solution. Many of the most advanced credit markets in the world allow residents to use multiple IDs without favouring any one system.

Is the Existing System Limited to Banks?

Not at all.

As the data below from the BoG shows the Ghanaian credit bureaus obtain their data from sources that go beyond the traditional banking system including government agencies and retailers.

Furthermore in 2021 the BoG activated powers under section 13 of the LI 2394 regulations to demand that other data holders in the economy not reporting to the credit bureaus commence doing so. The directive is so informative about the state of credit referencing in Ghana that it is worthwhile publishing it in full.

The delay in reporting by some utilities mobile network operators fintech institutions and mobile money platforms contrary to law is due more to unwillingness to foot the data and data security infrastructure bill than to the absence of policy intent. Some major commercial data owners are also averse to the loss of competitive advantage if their competitors can access the same market insights that they have.

None of these problems can be fixed by introducing a new system backed by Ghana Card. What is required is effective implementation of the law continuous sensitisation and the encouragement of data infrastructure pooling by industry associations.

Reporting Gaps not Unique to Ghana

It bears mentioning also that everywhere in the world some data reporters are preferred more than others by credit bureaus.

According to IFC data banks predominate globally in the ranks of data providers simply because creditors think they are best placed to help them with information about a borrower’s payment habits.

Courts and public databases for instances are consulted by less than 30% of credit bureaus worldwide.

Likewise 95% of credit bureaus track debt defaults but only 44% of them bother to link to tax information.

There are many practical and operational reasons why credit bureaus favour some data sources over others. None of these reasons will cease to exist because the government chooses to launch its own scheme.

Will adding the Ghana Card to the mix make any difference?

Not in the least.

The current process has already made accommodation for the use of the Ghana Card dating back to 2012 when both the Ghana Card and credit scoring system were in their infancy. Nothing stops the banks telecom companies and any institution that are now required by law to collect Ghana Card information during transactions from adding the Ghana Card number to the reports they file to the credit bureaus.

The Ghana Card database has far fewer fields per subject than the reporting template used by the credit bureaus. Thus the credit bureaus whose template can accommodate 178 unique data fields have richer data on many citizens than does the operator of the Ghana Card system. Below the credit reporting format is reproduced in part to make a point.

It should be clear from the above that not only does the reporting pipeline for credit bureaus allow them to enrich the profile of a subject/citizen with multiple ID cards including the Ghana Card it also allows for such fascinating data sources as e-Zwich SSNIT data and voter records.

Once again the challenge here is with respect to the cost of the infrastructure and the efficiency of management processes at the level of each data reporter. One cannot expect a Makola shop however large in today’s Ghana to comply with the law that says that data on any credit they extend should be compiled in CSV files and submitted to credit bureaus. The reason is not because Ghana Card is not in the mix but simply because they likely lack the capacity in terms of personnel and equipment. It is inconceivable how an entire Vice Presidential policy unit confronted with such a challenge would suggest that Ghana Card somehow “addresses the problem”.

Nor can this be considered the burden of the credit bureaus either. This is an extremely tight-margin business. One of the 3 bureaus initially licensed dropped out for sheer inability to make ends meet.

What about “tighter integration” of the ecosystem to create a “national credit platform”?

The integration idea is dangerously seductive until one delves into the details.

There must be a reason why in every serious country competition among not just credit referencing/scoring bureaus but also among models formulas and approaches is the right way forward. Whilst the underlying algorithms may be similar such that in the US for instance all the three major credit bureaus license the FICO model from Fair Isaac (as indeed does some bureaus in Nigeria) and then flavour it their own way the practice is nonetheless for different lenders and economic actors to explore increasingly creative ways to lend to more and more previously excluded people without worsening default risk.

No one denies that all credit data users in Ghana especially the financial institutions are on the lookout for better insights about their borrowers. Or that the current credit scoring system needs a lot of enhancement to meet the aspirations of its users. What is being contended is the reason for this inadequacy. It neither stems from the absence of Ghana Card from the scene nor from the lack of conceptual recognition that reporting must improve.

Forcing through more data-sharing across the government ecosystem however runs the risk of coming foul of privacy restrictions in the credit referencing/scoring law itself. As the regulations clearly say consent is key except in cases of aggravated default.

The idea that the Citizen App Credit Scoring system will simply hoover data from all over the place and serve it through an online system is contrary to law as section 14 of the regulations clearly state that any provision of data to a credit bureau or agency must be by consent. The situation would not be different for a government app.

What about the suggestion to move from “referencing” to “scoring”

First the current credit bureaus have the capacity to produce individualised credit scores and do issue them. Dun & Bradstreet (D&B) for instance was founded in 1841 and has had a long time to perfect its craft. It is probably the leading credit scorer of businesses worldwide and its proprietary Paydex system is widely known. It would make no sense for D&B to set up a subsidiary in Ghana and not provide it with scoring capacity so long as data providers make the data available. D&B regularly markets its products to financial institutions and affirm its ability to generate scores as attested to by the brochure extract below.

The credit bureaus provide an online avenue for anyone to apply and access their reports. Nonetheless because the law requires that they provide a free report annually to individuals there is no business incentive in it for them to focus on “self-reporting” with the end result that last year only about 500 people requested for their reports and the embedded scores. In these circumstances it is not surprising that the vast majority of Ghanaians don’t know their credit scores (bearing in mind of course that even in the US some surveys show up to 61% of respondents not knowing their scores).

The bureaus focus on marketing to commercial entities who pay per use. Efforts to develop subscription products have been very challenging and credit transaction volume is still quite low limiting the number of paid hits from which the bureaus make their money (still the volume in Ghana is 9x that in Uganda).

It is perplexing however for some commentators to insist that there is no credit scoring per se in Ghana despite the abundance of evidence. Even lenders targeting the low-end of the market feature their stance on credit scores in their promotions.

The bureaus also attempt to educate the public on their websites.

It will be curious to know how the likes of Thomas Blankson and others at XDS who have been labouring since 2014 to enhance local credit scoring would think of this. Or how those who have to ensure the privacy and security compliance of the system like the Isaac Benings of this world think of this whole debate. But given the political sensitivity public commentary is too much to expect from the bureaus themselves.

Anyway no one can force a creditor to make a credit decision

Because technical judgement goes into the quality of a credit reporting system competition is essential. Lenders need to be able to switch a credit scoring provider if their predictions of credit risk over time do not align with the reality as perceived by the lender.

And whilst the law says that the lender must obtain a credit report before making a decision it cannot force the lender to rely on any one report score or formula to determine who is likely to pay or not. At most it can seek to prevent deliberate discrimination or other unlawful behavior. In the end however every institution is responsible to its shareholders for making sound credit decisions.

That is why regardless of the existence of credit bureaus all serious lenders and businesses exposed to counterparty risk develop their own internal systems to protect their business.

The process of how MTN Ghana models the credit risk of its Qwik Loan borrowers is so interesting that it bears posting in full an extract from Vincent Guermond’s fascinating 2022 survey of the subject.

Yes in case you missed it dear reader some telco operators are going to the extent of using battery power levels to improve their ability to model credit risk.

It would be arrogance of the worst sort for any government to believe that it can budge in and outperform frontline economic actors with skin in the game as to how to manage risk. What the government can obviously do is to improve the overall macroeconomic environment strengthen privacy-preserving data-sharing in the ecosystem by making and enforcing the right regulations and use its convening power and moral authority to promote innovative thinking by key decision-makers.

So is there no way Ghana can be creative for its own needs in this area?

There are indeed scholars analysts and visionaries who have questioned the traditional credit referencing approach given the peculiar nature of the African economy.

For example Management Professor Marc Epstein and then Opportunity International CEO Christopher Crane after field research in Ghana wrote a paper in 2005 (later added to the compilation “Business Solutions for the Global Poor”) containing some ideas of how credit risk management needs modification to better suit contexts such as Ghana’s. This foundation was built upon in 2013 by Nigerian academics into a framework that has yet to be translated in the real world.

Building novel credit scoring systems that adapt well to the African terrain would likely be the product of entrepreneurial thinking among competing credit scoring providers than something that emanates from government fiat. It would require even greater objectivity and impartiality on the part of the government to enforce regulations that level the playing field so that the best ideas can emerge. The government picking and choosing winners in such a fraught and complex domain will likely lead to technical obsolescence and the lost of trust in the reliability of the system.

For example the government has made its policy intent clear that it wants to promote more credit to consumers regardless of station. The truth however is that for businesses the aim is to find profitable customers not just any customers. If the sense grows that the government is motivated by electoral outcomes in boosting credit regardless of ability to afford credit businesses will simply disregard the state-controlled credit-scoring system and rely even more on their internal systems defeating the purpose of removing information asymmetries in order to lower the risk perception and thus the cost of credit.

What is the fear or harm though?

So maybe an extra credit scoring mechanism would be redundant so what? Ungrounded overenthusiasm on the part of politicians is an inalienable part of the political system why should people fret too much? This author was rattled by the announcement to launch a credit scoring system anchored on the Ghana Card and accessible through the Citizen App because it follows a worrying pattern.

Because the Ghana Card system is extremely expensive and dominated by the private half of the putative Public-Private Partnership model a lot of decisions of how where and why to use it for what and which purposes tend to be driven by whether it will lead to more people opting to pay the hefty fees to acquire cards on a premium basis.

The private investor who has been assured of hundreds of millions of dollars in financial return (with government exposure to the partner in the next few years alone topping $100 million besides the government’s own costs of personnel and vehicles etc. for the enrollment aspect) constantly scans the economy for opportunities that they can muscle in using the Ghana Card as mere pretext.

That is the only way to explain why and how the Ghana Card gets injected into scenarios where it is either redundant or useless all the time in recent times. Sometimes real damage can result.

Last year Ghana’s already beleaguered football league nearly suffered a fit when totally inexplicably a decision was taken that footballers and their clubs will be denied registration if they did not enroll onto the Ghana Card. Similar wooly-headed interferences by the Ghana Card where it adds no clear value are distracting from serious stuff.

The country is in the middle of transitioning from a model where people own their own liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) cylinders and fill them at various dispensing points to one where the cylinders are picked up from a few select points and returned empty for a full or partially full one. The whole model has been fraught with stakeholder disquiet and operational confusion.

Yet rather than concentrate on fixing the incoherence of banning the filling of self-owned cylinders at retail points whilst promoting the pickup of cylinders at circulation depots where there will still have to be instant filling to allow for different volumes to be sold the downstream gas operator is instead insisting that gas will not be sold to citizens without Ghana Cards. Knowing very well that millions of Ghanaians do not have the card and can only get one within a reasonable timeframe if they pay through the nose at a so-called “premium center“.

As should be clear from the above the Ghana Card has no exceptional role to play in enhancing Ghana’s credit scoring system. This is so painfully obvious as to be mind-numbing.

If the government insists on going ahead with the idea of launching a new credit-scoring system accessible through the Citizen App instead of just adding a simple non-revolutionary button in the user interface for a citizen to request their current scores from the bureau purely as a matter of convenience then we will have to take counsel from an old Igbo saying. It is said that when you see a toad in broad daylight you must focus on what must be pursuing it.

The hugely popular indie game was key to the genre’s boom in attention and has influenced many games to come since ultimately leading to the likes of Enter the Gungeon Hades Nuclear Throne and more. Its ground-up remake The Binding of Isaac Rebirth secured its place in history boasting an ‘overwhelmingly positive’ 97% Steam rating across 238000 reviews and now you can finally play it over the internet with friends thanks to the addition of online multiplayer.

The Binding of Isaac Repentance online multiplayer beta is now live. In order to join you’ll first need to have Repentance installed the most recent DLC upgrade for The Binding of Isaac Rebirth. You’ll then be able to hop into the online beta using a Binding of Isaac multiplayer password (full instructions below) and play one of the best roguelike games of all time in a fully fledged co-op multiplayer format with support for up to four players.

It’s a fair upgrade from the game’s previous local co-op offering which saw the second player join as more of an assist character that borrows some health from the main character. Now you and up to three friends can join the same game. It’s certain to be chaos mitigated only somewhat by the fact you’ll have to share all those upgrades between you. You’ll move between rooms together switching as soon as any player walks through a door so no splitting up to look for clues.

While there’s currently no new items or characters executive producer Tyrone Rodriguez notes that there are “a few updated game mechanics to improve the fun of playing Isaac in co-op mode.” He also emphasizes that this mode will only ever be available for players using the Repentance DLC although if you’re still playing The Binding of Isaac in 2023 then you’ll almost certainly want to be doing so anyway.

The game’s UI has been adapted for co-op and you can further tweak it to adjust how your partners’ health and items are displayed on your screen. Online multiplayer also has access to achievements and will get its own set of completion marks separate from your single-player game. You won’t unlock either when joining a match in progress however so you’ll need to be there from the start of a run.

How to join The Binding of Isaac multiplayer beta

If you want to join the multiplayer beta for yourself you’ll first want to back up your save – the team stresses that this is very much a beta test and wants to ensure you don’t lose all your hard-earned progress. Then simply right-click the title in your Steam Library select Properties go to the Betas tab and type the current beta key into the Private Betas code box which will then allow you to opt into the latest beta branch. To return to the base game simply select ‘None’ in the Beta Participation drop-down menu.

The first beta password is ‘combthedesert’ (without the quotation marks). Rodriguez says “the beta will generally be available two weeks out of each month and offline the other two weeks.” A new opt-in password will be shared with every new cycle by Rodriguez who says you should keep an eye on his X/Twitter account for updates. Finally the team highly encourages bug reports – it asks that you stick to a fairly rigid format so be sure to read the instructions before you get started.

The Binding of Isaac is one of my most played Steam games ever and will always hold a special place in my heart so I’m certainly excited to finally try it out with friends in a more fully fledged format. If you’re eager to help test or just check out how it’s coming along you can do so right now.

Considering the industry’s rosy prospects it could be wise to invest in quality industrial stock Vertiv Holdings Co (VRT) for solid returns. But investors could hold Fastenal Company (FAST) and wait for a better entry point in this stock while avoiding struggling ChargePoint Holdings Inc. (CHPT) seems prudent.

Before delving deeper into the fundamentals of these stocks let’s discuss what’s shaping the industrial sector’s outlook.

Robust demand for industrial equipment and services for numerous applications across end-markets including transportation consumer products packaging electronics medical devices and healthcare aerospace chemicals agriculture metals and mining energy and more create various high-growth opportunities for companies in the industrial sector.

The global industrial machinery market is expected to reach $1.04 trillion by 2032 growing at a CAGR of 5.3% from 2023 to 2032. Industrial machinery refers to equipment machinery and tools used in manufacturing processing and producing goods across multiple industries.

The industrial machinery market has been growing steadily over the past years propelled by the demand for automation and the modernization of production processes. Also the market’s growth is driven by the growing adoption of advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) Artificial Intelligence (AI) cloud big data analysis and robotics.

The global Industry 4.0 market is projected to reach $482 billion by 2032 growing at a CAGR of 20.7% during the forecast period (2023-2030). Advancements in technology have provided the foundation for Industry 4.0. It allows manufacturers to boost productivity and efficiency and lower costs by optimizing resource utilization streamlining processes and reducing waste.

Growing infrastructure spending by governments will further drive the industrial sector’s growth. President Biden signed the $1 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure bill into law two years ago putting nearly $550 billion of new federal funds into America’s infrastructure over the next five years improving the nation’s transportation broadband and utilities.

Considering these conducive trends let’s take a look at the fundamentals of the three Industrial – Equipment stocks starting with number 3.

Chris Weilminster and Timothy Mount are the founding partners of Hg80 a real estate investment and development firm that aims to help clients with projects; leasing and merchandising; asset management; deal structuring; and planning and design. Don Briggs is a managing partner at the new firm.

Don Briggs (Hg80)

Weilminster announced Hg80's debut in a post on LinkedIn this week. He and Briggs have known each other for more than two decades and worked together at New York-based Urban Edge and Federal Realty in Rockville Maryland two REITs that are retail and mixed-use landlords. Mount a design expert and urban planner is a founding partner of Street-Works Studio in Port Chester New York.

The team at Hg80 with headquarters in Boston has longstanding relationships with retailers and the real estate community as well as experience with development projects and master planning Weilminster told CoStar News on Friday.

""We believe there is an opportunity and a real need with either family offices pension funds private equity groups that have control of very large real estate ... [to] directly use our vision ... and turn it into something that adds real value and creates community for where that real estate sits"" he said.

In its marketing brochure Hg80 said it is looking to partner with owners and investors to reposition and redevelop underutilized properties into retail-driven mixed-use destinations; work with lenders to stabilize challenged properties; collaborate with towns to form public-private partnerships; invest alongside owners and developers; provide advisory services; and acquire retail mixed-use and urban properties in New England the Northeast mid-Atlantic Southeast and Florida.

Tim Mount (Hg80)

As for the firm's name Briggs explained he and his partners wanted to use something related to Mercury the Greek god of speed luck and commerce. And in numerology 80 is associated with buildings that benefit the community. Hg80 the periodic symbol and atomic number for the element mercury embodied all those ideas according to Briggs.

Weilminster the former chief operating officer of Urban Edge left the firm roughly a year ago. During his four-year stint at the company he was responsible for managing all operations and driving redevelopment activity for the REIT's shopping centers which are concentrated in the New England to Washington D.C. corridor.

Before that Weilminster spent roughly 29 years at Federal Realty with his last post there as an executive vice president and president of the REIT's mixed-use division.

Briggs worked with Weilminster for years at Federal Realty and then joined him when he went to Urban Edge serving as president of development. Briggs spent the past two years as a managing director at Eastern Real Estate.

Mount and his design firm worked on various projects with Weilminster and Briggs at Federal Realty including Assembly Row in Somerville Massachusetts and Pike & Rose in North Bethesda Maryland.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcmVhbGRlYWwuY29tL21pYW1pLzIwMjMvMTIvMDEvdmFkaWFzLXN1bnNldC1wbGFjZS1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1pbi1zb3V0aC1taWFtaS1tb3Zlcy1haGVhZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Vadia's Sunset Place Development in South Miami Moves Ahead,"Midtown Miami developer Alex Vadia is moving forward with plans to redevelop the Shops at Sunset Place a shopping center in South Miami.

British design and architecture firm Heatherwick Studio and ODP Architecture & Design will be working on the master plan and timeline for the 10-plus-acre property at 5701 Southwest 72nd Street.

Vadia’s Midtown Opportunities paid $65.5 million Sunset Place in early 2021 a steep discount from its previous $110.2 million sale price in 2015.

The former owners Federal Realty Investment Trust Grass River Property and the Comras Company planned to redevelop the half-a-million square-foot mall into a mixed-use development with apartment buildings and a hotel component but failed to receive enough city support.

Vadia’s firm has yet to disclose specific plans for the property but the redevelopment does include a residential component. Last week the South Miami Commission unanimously approved zoning ordinances that will allow the developer to build up to 33 stories along the portion of the property fronting U.S. 1 from the 12 stories currently allowed.

At the meeting on Nov. 21 South Miami commissioner Josh Liebman said the city wants to preserve its main street at a human scale likely capped at two stories along Sunset Drive.

Midtown Opportunities wants to remove the focus on big box tenants the developer said. Sunset Place’s anchor tenants include AMC Theatres L.A. Fitness and Barnes & Noble. The new project would include smaller retail tenants and restaurants.

Vadia’s father Alberto Vadia was heavily involved in the plans for Sunset Place. He died this week at the age of 76.

Sunset Place currently includes a small condominium component which would likely have to be terminated.

Midtown Opportunities’ new project will mark Heatherwick’s first in the state. The design firm has worked on Google campuses the renovation of Pacific Place in Hong Kong and the Little Island pier park in New York City.

Before Sunset Place opened in 1998 the site was home to the Bakery Center a fortress-like retail complex developed by Martin Marguilies. The property was demolished within a decade of its completion.

New tenants are moving into downtown South Miami including the bakery dbakers Sweet Studio.

South of Sunset Place apartment developer AvalonBay Communities is building a new mixed-use apartment building on the site of the former Winn-Dixie property at 5850 Southwest 73rd Street. The ground floor of that project will be home to a Fresh Market grocery store sources told The Real Deal.

Alex Karakhanian’s Lndmrk Development sold the property to Raguas LLC for $10.1 million in a deal brokered by Dwntwn Realty Advisors’ Tony Arellano and Devlin Marinoff.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vY29tbWVyY2lhbG9ic2VydmVyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEyL3doZXJlLXRvLWludmVzdC1pbi1jb21tZXJjaWFsLXJlYWwtZXN0YXRlLXRoYXQtd2FzLXF1ZXN0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Where to Invest in Commercial Real Estate? That Was the Question.,"Micro- and macroeconomic trends collided at Commercial Observer’s annual Capital Markets and Opportunistic Strategies Forum on Nov. 28 at 22 Vanderbilt a newly renovated mixed-use office property on the site of the old Biltmore Hotel next to Grand Central Terminal in Midtown Manhattan.

After a few words from the building’s host Damon Lopez-O’Dwyer from Milstein Properties (and there were also a few words from Adrienne Coyle of Starwood Solutions one of the event’s sponsors) the morning opened with Ryan Severino chief economist and head of research at investment firm BGO holding court with Sam Chandan founding director and professor at the C.H. Chen Institute for Global Real Estate Finance at the New York University Stern School of Business.

Severino took a contrarian view on Chandan’s suggestion that the U.S. would enter a recession first by noting that he’s “probably on the more optimistic side than the average person” and then adding that he’s been convinced that the country would avoid a recession since June 2022 shortly after the Federal Reserve initiated its swiftest interest rate hike in 40 years.

“I feel like the data has only vindicated that story” Severino said. “I think the economy is different and far more resilient than people would have thought when the Fed started raising especially when they were raising aggressively and I don’t see any reason to back down from that now.”

He said that he doesn’t expect the Fed to raise interest rates in the near future mainly because he doesn’t expect inflation to jump high enough to warrant any increases. However he hedged that position by noting that he’s merely taking Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell at his word.

“They face an asymmetrical risk structure too: If they raise too much they say that we needed a recession to bring inflation down; but if they don’t raise enough and then things re-accelerate … then they get roundly castigated” explained Severino.

During the next panel — a discussion on how investors can find opportunities in an uncertain market and moderated by Jay Neveloff of Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel — David Schwarz head of commercial real estate strategies at Amherst an investment and development firm suggested that not everything is making sense on the equity side. That’s mainly because transaction volumes are down and deals are coming only through a pipeline of existing borrowers.

“My general view is you have to be in the market and that means trying to turn over every stone” said Schwarz. “There’s a lot of different forms deals can take but once interest rates start to stabilize there will be comfort in pricing pricing on debt and pricing on equity and sellers might not like it but that’s the progression things will start to take.”

Shlomo Chopp managing partner at lender Terra Strategies sits at the intersection of borrowers and lenders in his real estate consulting work. Chopp noted that many lenders are only accepting extensions or paydowns in this current market — one that has $1.5 trillion of maturities due over the next two years — and this stance has opened up rare off-market opportunities.

“I actually think the reason why deals are happening where people don’t see them is because there are off-market opportunities” said Chopp. “If you’re a borrower with a lender you can transact off-market without the lender coming to market.”

In terms of specific asset classes to invest in one panelist pointed at hospitality as the safest path forward. Eli Sokol vice president of development and investment in North America for hotel company CitizenM praised the New York City hospitality industry which he said has recovered over the past two years.

“This city has enduring appeal” said Sokol. “Regulations in place here are helping incumbents in the space perform well: zoning restrictions on new hotels have helped existing hotels there’s Airbnb regulations that happened. … So the demand is definitely there.”

Nicholas Baccile a director at investment firm Canyon Partners Real Estate wasn’t nearly as effusive about an asset class on everyone’s mind: office. Baccile described office (rather derisively) as “the new retail” which he said was “an incredibly oversupplied asset class” over the last 20 years.

“We had millions of square feet of malls that had massive spaces and a lot are going away a lot are being repurposed … and now office faces similar challenges” said Baccile. “It’s a fundamental thing. It’s supply and demand [especially] if demand has gone to three days per week.”

The final panel of the morning featured several executives holding a symposium to demystify distressed asset investment strategies. Robert Dickey managing director of investments at investor Invesco gave a brief history lesson.

He recalled how during the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s commercial real estate was still in the “the stone age” as there weren’t many distressed funds set up yet to take advantage of underwater loans. It was only after

created the

to sell distressed real estate loans on the market in one fell swoop that a small group of crafty firms made the first initial killings in the sector.

“That proved to be the golden era of distressed investing” said Dickey.

Dickey added that after the 2008 Global Financial Crisis the Fed wised up to its previous mistakes and made sure its next loan sales program allowed the public to receive an increased share of any upside on the purchases of distressed loans. He also noted that the special servicer industry of commercial mortgage-backed securities which is only 30 years old realized “extend and pretend” is now the best method to recover original loan balances.

“There isn’t the abundant distress from the 1990s both because the Fed has gotten smarter and the special servicers have gotten smarter” said Dickey. “Selling things at the moment of heating which is probably going to be 2024 is the wrong time to sell an asset.”

Dags Chen head of U.S. real estate research and strategy at investment giant Barings cautioned the audience that each real estate cycle is different previous cycles set up current ones and that humility is “absolutely necessary” when entering the world of distress.

“You could argue both sides: there’s going to be a lot of distress there’s not going to be distress” said Chen. “The key is how you access that opportunity. It’s going to be a combination of various things: skill luck and timing is critical.”

Spencer Garfield managing director at Fortress Investment Group took an unmistakably pessimistic tone arguing that we’re in a distressed market now and will be for a number of years. He noted that there’s been overbuilding across the Phoenix MIami and Austin multifamily markets; New York City has higher expenses and political risk from anti-development local politicians; and recent legislation out of Los Angeles added political risk to future commercial real estate investment.

“We believe that we are in a distressed market and if you’re marking your book right you’re taking losses and if you’re taking losses and you’re smart you take those losses and redeploy that capital and earn a high rate of return [on that capital]” explained Garfield.

Ultimately Garfield tried to lighten the mood by telling the audience many of whom included young professionals that playing the board of distressed real estate “is not an easy game.”

“Having real estate experience and a bank account doesn’t put you in a position to play distress” he said. “It comes from asset management experience workout experience understanding how borrowers respond and it’s dependent on asset type geography. … You have to have foresight you have to take some risk.”

“It’s a complicated game” he added.

Also appearing on the panel with them was Daniel Wrublin of Dalan Real Estate and David DesPrez of Bain Capital.

Minerva Realty Consultants President Merrie Frankel moderated a panel later in the day on retail-focused REITs with Acadia Realty Trust CEO Ken Bernstein Empire State Realty Trust COO and CFO Christina Chiu Whitestone REIT COO Christine Mastandrea and Kurt Ivey senior vice president of marketing at mall owner Macerich.

Bernstein spoke about how he’s seen the pre-pandemic “retail armageddon” turn into an office armageddon and a retail renaissance while Chiu added that retail in ESRT’s portfolio has served as an amenity for its office tenants. Markets with high residential density — and low office density — have flourished most on days when people work from home.

“I thought we were going to have to wait for a return to office for our retail to come back” Bernstein said. “It turned out that when the residential market rebounded so did our stores in Williamsburg SoHo and the majority of our portfolio throughout the country. I agree that retail is a very important and profitable component of an [amenitized] office but whether folks are going into the office three or four days a week doesn’t seem to impact our retailers. In fact … Thursday’s the new Friday; our restaurants are getting an extra turn in the city.”

The next panel brought together moderator Peter Borock from law firm Greenberg Traurig with Fundrise CEO Ben Miller and Blackstone (BX) Managing Director Tony LaBarbera. The discussion was all about chasing the most bang for the buck in the marketplace. To that end LaBarbera said Blackstone was deploying capital to assets like student housing storage and multifamily.

Miller’s investment platform however is cutting back on insurance overhead in Florida and high property taxes in Texas by shifting away from markets with those kinds of headwinds. Other urban problems like homelessness and crime have also made Fundrise shy of investments in those markets.

“Both of those things have actually made deals no longer make any sense in Florida and Texas in my view” Miller said. “Georgia North Carolina South Carolina Tennessee — that’s where we’ve been mostly buying since the end of the year.”

Commercial Observer Editor in Chief Max Gross led the next panel which was about detonating all the supposed dry powder on the sidelines. The panel included Adrian Berger managing director at Cypress Equity Investments; CIM Group Managing Director Jay Fischer; Michael Lavipour senior managing director at Affinius Capital; and CWCapital CIO Gina Lubin.

Berger said there’s no easy process for identifying where opportunities lie. Instead they often come out of states like Texas where land can be developed to suit a particular need or in targeting the assets of businesses that are under distress such as Bed Bath & Beyond stores.

In spite of their risks investments in office properties aren’t out of the question but are still a long shot.

“It’s an asset class that has a lot of issues and nobody knows how deep it is” Fischer said. “With the retail apocalypse it was like only the top 300 assets will survive then it was the top 200 and then the top 300. I think the office market is trying to figure that out right now. I think from our perspective yes office is investable for us but it’s highly dependent on what and where it is the structure and basis we’re coming in at. There are a lot of nuances that would make it acceptable.”

The day’s final panel which Kasowitz Benson Torres partner Jennifer Recine moderated had more to say on capital deployment.

For those playing the long game malls and regional shopping centers are likely a good bet according to Lemore Czeisler vice president of development at Pacific Retail Capital Partners. Czeisler was on the panel with Andy Marshall head of capital markets at Bonaventure; Hoya Capital CIO David Auerbach; and Robert O’Leary East Coast vice president of franchise development for Choice Hotels Extended Stay.

“There’s going to be moderate but solid growth leasing activity is through the roof — I mean sure it’s because there was a ton of vacant space — but still … [net operating income] is projected to grow 4 percent roughly over the next five years” Czeisler said of shopping centers. “The only thing that needs to occur are a couple of years of sweat through entitlements and getting through this debt market where you can do new construction. … I think that the mall space and regional shopping centers are really undervalued.”

Up on the seventh floor of 22 Vanderbilt RXR CEO Scott Rechler and Bob Knakal head of JLL’s New York private capital group led the closing keynote over cocktails.

While commercial real estate has been a challenging environment over the last few years Rechler and Knakal’s views were that of old industry veterans: that it’s not the first time the market has been at a crossroads and people found their way from the 1980s and early 1990s — not to mention the financial crisis in 2008 — when tax reforms turned valuations on their heads to interest rates being 18 percent at times.

“You have to keep that parallel in mind” Rechler said. “The difference is that we’ve lived through almost two decades of a near-zero interest rate regime. … So everyone who had been borrowing and buying over the last 15 to 20 years now needs to reset the value of their real estate reset their capital structure and that’s a painful process.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2J0di5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9hdGxhbnRhL21ldHJvLWhvbWUtc2VsbGVycy1zdWUtcmVhbHR5LWNvbXBhbmllcy1zYXktY29tbWlzc2lvbi1mZWVzLW1ha2luZy1ob21lLXByaWNlcy1pbGxlZ2FsbHktd2FycGVkLzU3TjVGS1ZaQUZDSU5HTFlTT1lGQkhUUjVJL9IBswFodHRwczovL3d3dy53c2J0di5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9hdGxhbnRhL21ldHJvLWhvbWUtc2VsbGVycy1zdWUtcmVhbHR5LWNvbXBhbmllcy1zYXktY29tbWlzc2lvbi1mZWVzLW1ha2luZy1ob21lLXByaWNlcy1pbGxlZ2FsbHktd2FycGVkLzU3TjVGS1ZaQUZDSU5HTFlTT1lGQkhUUjVJLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Metro home sellers sue realty companies say commission fees making home prices ‘illegally warped’,"We’re Sorry!

That metaphor wasn’t in the job description when Langdon joined Washington’s NFL franchise as the overseer of FedEx Field in December 2021 after spending 16 years with the NBA’s Charlotte Hornets. But she knew she would be charged with sprucing up a dilapidated building … while fans friends and foes rooted for the wrecking ball.

Langdon’s roles with the Hornets varied but she most recently ran their events and operations department managing daily activities of all shapes and sizes that occurred year-round in the 19000-seat Spectrum Center.

With that experience and having played — like her brother former Duke star and current general manager of the New Orleans Pelicans Trajan Langdon — college basketball in Division I Trista knew she could handle the pressure of running a 70000-seat NFL stadium. The first test came Jan. 2 2022 after Washington’s game against the Philadelphia Eagles.

“You get a call and you go through the (interview) process and you have a high-level understanding of the objectives of the building” Langdon said. “Then you come to work on the first day — and experience it.”

Langdon was in postgame mode on the stadium’s club level following Washington’s loss when her cellphone buzzed. She was told that a railing had collapsed by the field. Fans were involved — along with Eagles star quarterback Jalen Hurts.

That’s when Langdon’s vision changed dramatically. Any ideas about transforming the Prince George’s County property which appears older than you’d expect for having opened in 1997 immediately went on hold.

“It was pretty apparent from the day that I got in that we were going take a few steps back” Langdon said.

Whether season-ticket loyalists or those who stayed away because they were fed up with FedEx fans have waited years for the organization’s stadium plans to move forward. Not an upgrade of FedEx Field which was the butt of countless jokes and league-wide derision even before what Hurts described as a “near-tragic incident” or a significant water (sewage?) leak that dumped on patrons early in that 2021 season.

Rather to somewhere or something new. Not simply for the futuristic amenities that new colosseums offer. They want out of the stadium that’s better described as old than venerable. The one that The Athletic and countless others have declared the league’s worst.

“I have been complaining about that dump for years” Eagles longtime radio announcer Merrill Reese said after the railing collapse. Reese chose not to attend that game because of his disdain.

“Almost everything about it is below the standard of what an NFL stadium should be” one player said in The Athletic’s anonymous poll published last month.

Regardless of the anger and mockery the staff continues caring for the stadium as well as possible. That job falls to Langdon and vice president of guest experience Joey Colby-Begovich a perpetually upbeat individual who is the emotional counterweight to Langdon’s stoicism.

“I tend to talk about the nuts and bolts and the not-so-pretty” Langdon said “and then Joey brings in all the rainbows and fireworks to ensure our fans have a great time.”

Together they lead Washington’s effort to produce positive game-day experiences even when the masses arrive expecting the worst. Both have eyes open to their customers’ frustrations saying multiple times that FedEx Field was “undermaintained” during the years Dan Snyder owned the team.

Billionaire investor Josh Harris a lifelong Washington fan leads a deep-pocketed group of partners who purchased the Commanders from Snyder for $6.05 billion in July. He’s already well aware of the maintenance struggles.

“I can’t say I’m super excited when I have to get on an 11:00 call and talk about leaks and bathrooms and puddles and seats that are broken” Harris said before the season opener.

The vague timeline for any new digs opening is 2030 … ish. The duo has work to do until Harris finalizes a course of action with D.C. Virginia or Maryland officials and a new stadium is built.

“All of us are super excited (for) the idea of a new stadium” Langdon said in September “but we have a very much functioning stadium … (that we’re) hopeful to continue to maintain and bring back up to standard. We’re here to ensure all of our great Commanders fans are coming in and seeing value in the stadium and the product we’re putting out every day.”

Maryland state and local officials led by Gov. Wes Moore and Lt. Gov Aruna Miller have aggressively sought to keep the franchise in the state. Economic and transportation investments along the Blue Line Corridor near FedEx Field include $400 million in state funding.

“The Commanders have called Prince George’s County home for 25 years and Governor Moore is committed to continuing this long-standing partnership” said Carter Elliott Moore’s press secretary. “Governor Moore looks forward to continuing conversations with the Commanders about our vision for the future of the Commanders in Maryland.”

The team owners including NBA legend Magic Johnson have spent ample time making the local rounds to re-engage fans and the ticket-buying public. So far so good. The franchise that ranked last in attendance percentage last season (85.9) has announced sellouts for all five home games. Fans and skeptics returned for the Sept. 10 opener against the Arizona Cardinals which doubled as a celebration following Snyder’s long-awaited departure.

“It was a great day here” Langdon said “and we felt the emotions of our fans.”

Sponsors are also back. The organization has 13 new deals since the ownership change. There are also partnerships with the Air Force and Air National Guard.

Those making their first appearance of the season for Sunday’s game against the Miami Dolphins will notice a difference from previous visits. New video boards LED enhancements and upgraded sound systems headline the $40 million investments.

Harris loves mentioning “ingress and egress” a technical way of saying they’re seeking ways to limit traffic jams on the way to and from the stadium. That’s already occurring as in-and-out times have decreased by 40 minutes per a team spokesperson.

The managing partner hopes to see the football team cook opponents on the field — and food workers be able to cook in the kitchens.

“I mean one of the things we didn’t have enough of? Ovens” a perplexed Harris revealed.

More mending is coming. Some matters are challenging to tackle in-season and the sale occurred less than a month before the preseason opener. There are forward-thinking expenditures that will allow the franchise to reuse expensive equipment at a new stadium. Expectations for 2024 include the final phase of sound system upgrades a premium loge area that will “function as a high-end exclusive day-club experience” and automated food and beverage installations across the stadium.

These and other efforts won’t turn every frown upside down. Complaining about FedEx Field is now in the bloodstream. A team spokesperson said that “winning cures all” isn’t a mere saying — fan satisfaction surveys score higher after victories. But the Commanders are now 4-8 and headed to a seventh consecutive season without a winning record with no obvious path to a quick turnaround.

Colby-Begovich said his career has been built on “removing points of friction from guest experience.” Even Sisyphus thinks that task seems impossible in this scenario. Still his desire for all visitors to have a great experience is sincere.

“When fans experience points of friction I do take that personally” Colby-Begovich said. “I am deeply invested in the way that we recover that service.”

Through negative and positive feedback the planning continues.

They train their staff about the “quirky” venue like which specific roads to enter from to park in a designated lot. Food beverages and non-football entertainment experiences are available in all stadiums. Why not make their options the best possible?

“These are soft things” Colby-Begovich said. “Trista is working on hard things like welding and joints —”

“And roof membranes” blurted Langdon.

That’s an actual term that in this instance involves floor coating and joint expansion in the 400 level — essentially the roof to the executive suites — to cut down on leaks and other water intrusions due to lack of maintenance. Some equipment has a lifespan of 12-15 years. FedEx Field’s third decade is around the bend.

Unfortunately for the organization another maintenance blooper occurred after Washington’s most recent home game when both locker rooms were without hot water afterward. An equipment failure with the main water heater could not be resolved without turning off the water which was an impossibility with thousands of fans in the stadium according to a team spokesperson. The Giants opted for cold showers rather than a stinky situation on the train ride home.

That came nearly two years after Langdon dealt with her first FedEx Field mishap. Spectators angling for an autograph or a picture with Hurts piled onto a temporary portion of the stands. Their collective weight caused it to break and they fell in Hurts’ direction. Fortunately Hurts and others avoided significant injury though several spectators sued the Commanders’ organization.

Langdon and professionals steeped in stadium analysis spent the next few days determining what happened and what’s next. They reviewed structural seating throughout the stadium. Deficiencies were found and rectified.

Not long after the railing collapsed Langdon got lost on the way down to the field because the closest elevator bank to her location did not go to that level. So very quirky. As the lack of hot water showed another stadium fumble is never far behind.

Several more years of FedEx Field oddities remain. Langdon will continue plugging holes while Colby-Begovich announced in November that he accepted a position with MLS’s Chicago Fire franchise. He will remain with the Commanders through the end of the regular season. That’s another six weeks for potential troubles — and good times.

“We spend a lot of time listening to how we can make sure those failures never happen again” Colby-Begovich said. “Yes it is emotional. It is personal. … We want the 65000 people who come here to have the time of their lives without a moment of challenges.”

Langdon and Colby-Begovich recognize that all the fresh paint and smiles won’t satisfy some customers or many or even most. But until they get new orders from their bosses breathing life into the stadium continues whether the masses want it or not.

CEO Raj Subramaniam didn’t help matters by going on TV at the time to warn that “economic conditions are not going to be good.” Investors spooked by the sudden post-COVID cooling of the logistics sector drove the company’s shares down by 20% in just one day the largest one-day drop in price.

The logistics company has since managed to turn things around with shares up over 70% from lows in September 2022. At the Fortune Global Forum in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday Subramaniam tried to explain what people are missing about the boom-and-bust shipping business. “If there was no pandemic … the trend would be kind of okay” he said. He noted that e-commerce represented about 16% of retail pre-pandemic surged to 22% during COVID then stabilized back to 19%.

“We’re normalizing to levels where we would have been had there been no pandemic especially on e-commerce” he said.

The logistics sector boomed during the pandemic as stay-at-home consumers flush with stimulus money flocked to e-commerce platforms to buy the latest home appliances consumer electronics and other big-ticket items. The surge in demand helped boost revenues at logistics companies that carried goods from factories to retailers and people’s homes.

FedEx was no exception. The firm reported revenue of $93.5 billion in its fiscal 2022 (which spans from June 1 2021 to May 31 2022) a more than 30% increase from the $69.2 billion reported in FedEx’s fiscal 2020. The company went on a hiring spree during the pandemic to keep goods flowing.

But after its profit warning last year FedEx announced a series of cost-cutting measures including store closures and service consolidations and pledged to become a leaner more focused company.

The belt-tightening may have worked. In its most recent quarter ended Aug. 31 FedEx beat analyst estimates and reported a rise in profit despite a drop in revenue. It also revised its forecast for its fiscal 2024 raising the lower end of its adjusted earnings per share to $17 from the previous forecast of $16.50. The company left the top end of its outlook unchanged at $18.50.

FedEx’s push to use new technology was part of that turnaround Subramaniam explained Wednesday.

“We have gotten going from reactive to predictive” Subramaniam said referring to the use of AI models to better predict estimated delivery times. “We’re able to now use some of those modern technologies and the new learning models on some of our data to see how we can create more value for our customers.”

Shipping and logistics have traditionally been slow to adopt new technologies but the supply-chain disruptions of the past few years have forced companies to start transforming their operations. Eighty percent of logistics professionals surveyed by CargoWise which helps companies streamline their logistics operations are increasing their investments in new technologies like supply-chain management systems and digital documentation.

Subramaniam knows that people are paying close attention to his industry and its hiccups—symbolized best perhaps by the bottlenecks of ships waiting off the U.S. West Coast to unload cargo in overloaded ports.

“Before 2019 if I had mentioned supply chains in polite conversation I would have been escorted out the door” he said Wednesday. “And now it seems to be talk show subjects.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9mZWRleC1jb3Jwb3JhdGlvbi1ueXNlLWZkeC1sYXJnZWx5LTExMDAyNjQyNi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 76% of the company,"Key Insights

Significantly high institutional ownership implies FedEx's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions

A total of 20 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership

Analyst forecasts along with ownership data serve to give a strong idea about prospects for a business

To get a sense of who is truly in control of FedEx Corporation (NYSE:FDX) it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company around 76% to be precise is institutions. In other words the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight especially with individual investors. Therefore a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.

In the chart below we zoom in on the different ownership groups of FedEx.

See our latest analysis for FedEx

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About FedEx?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

FedEx already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see FedEx's historic earnings and revenue below but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Institutional investors own over 50% of the company so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Hedge funds don't have many shares in FedEx. From our data we infer that the largest shareholder is Frederick Smith (who also holds the title of Top Key Executive) with 7.8% of shares outstanding. Its usually considered a good sign when insiders own a significant number of shares in the company and in this case we're glad to see a company insider play the role of a key stakeholder. In comparison the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.4% and 6.4% of the stock.

Story continues

Looking at the shareholder registry we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 20 shareholders meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of FedEx

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.

We can see that insiders own shares in FedEx Corporation. Insiders own US$5.1b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently.

General Public Ownership

The general public who are usually individual investors hold a 16% stake in FedEx. This size of ownership while considerable may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company there are other factors that are even more important. For instance we've identified 1 warning sign for FedEx that you should be aware of.

The planes came within 100 feet of each other that morning of Feb. 4 avoiding a collision when the FedEx plane’s pilot aborted his landing according to a federal report. The incident often cited by government officials advocating for improvements to the country’s air safety system put the lives of 131 passengers at risk.

Three days later the controller Damian Campbell sat down for an interview with National Transportation Safety Board investigators to discuss the near-collision. The 13-year traffic controller described having an “expectation bias” with Southwest because during his more than four years at Austin’s airport Southwest crews were typically ready to take off as soon as they got permission.

Recalling the circumstances around the incident Campbell said he “definitely could have held them” suggesting he could have directed the Southwest crew to wait.

“The expectation bias being what it was it looked to be a safe operation. But hindsight being 20/20 definitely could have held them” Campbell told the NTSB investigators according to a newly released 293-page transcript of the interview.

The NTSB on Wednesday published more than 3000 pages of documents including the transcript and other materials from the agency’s monthslong investigation into the incident. Among the materials are the agency’s interviews with people involved outlines of what actions were taken air traffic control and flight data and an accounting of the day’s weather conditions.

The investigative materials released do not state a probable cause for the incident. A determination for such an investigation typically comes within 18 months of an event according to Peter Knudson an NTSB spokesperson — meaning the NTSB’s final report could come next year.

Attempts to reach Campbell for comment Thursday were unsuccessful.

In the months since the incident many local state and federal officials have referred to the near-collision at Austin’s city-owned airport while advocating for improvements to the country’s air safety system. The Federal Aviation Administration which employs the nation’s air traffic controllers cited the incident as part of the agency’s rationale to direct a review of the nation’s airspace safety.

Though the NTSB’s investigation remains ongoing Knudson said this week’s disclosure represents the “majority of the factual information” needed to complete the investigation. The agency’s next steps he said are to analyze the information and draft a final report.

The NTSB does not have regulatory or enforcement authority. Instead the agency issues safety recommendations — likely the FAA in this case — to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

In a statement Chris Mullooly an FAA spokesperson declined to comment on the NTSB investigation or Campbell saying the FAA does not ""comment on open investigations or personnel matters.""

Poor weather conditions may have played a factor

That Saturday morning the Austin airport was blanketed with fog possibly obscuring the view of air traffic controllers directing arriving and departing flights.

Campbell told investigators he could see the FedEx plane's landing light as the aircraft began its descent to land. The Southwest plane however was not visible.

“We had this dense ground fog … you couldn’t see anything” Campbell said according to the transcript later adding he became concerned when he didn't hear Southwest's engine revving for takeoff. ""And at that point it became a critical issue.”

The Austin airport does not have the latest technology — called Airport Surface Detection System Model-X or ASDE-X — to aid air traffic controllers in tracking planes and vehicles on the ground. The technology currently used at 35 of the country's airports uses radar multilateration and satellite technology with the aim of reducing runway incursions.

Asking what could have helped him during the incident Campbell told investigators the Austin airport needed ASDE-X and additional personnel.

""ASDE-X is one thing I think we ... this facility should've had five years ago"" Campbell said according to the transcript. ""We definitely could have used more people. But in light of this situation I think the biggest thing would be ASDE-X.""

He continued ""Without ASDE-X without form of ground radar our operations come to almost a crawl in (inclement) weather.""

Actions taken by FAA local officials since the incident

While the NTSB investigation is ongoing the close call has sparked changes from the FAA and local officials running the Austin airport.

Earlier this month a board of independent experts empaneled to assess the nation’s airspace safety concluded the FAA needs better staffing equipment and technology to address an increase in close calls. The board’s 52-page report stated in part that the “current erosion in the margin of safety” has rendered the “current level of safety unsustainable.”

Days after the board's report was released the FAA announced it was taking ""immediate action"" to improve air traffic controller training and require more expansive safety reporting nationwide. Among the changes are additional support for colleges and universities with air traffic controller programs a year-round hiring plan and increased classroom capacity for FAA Academy.

The FAA plans to deploy tower simulator systems in 95 facilities by December 2025 with the first system slated for Austin by January 2024. The system can aid the training of controllers by simulating airport operations layout and tower airspace.

""This will mean much-improved training for controllers"" FAA spokesperson Mullooly said in a statement.

Locally Austin's Department of Aviation which oversees the city's share of airport operations is developing a ramp control program. Once implemented the program will ""enhance our ability to uphold safety and reliability for passengers flight crew and planes during aircraft movement on the terminal ramp"" said Jim Smith the airport's interim director in a memo to Austin City Council members last month.

This year two ground service employees — one an American Airlines employee and the second an employee of the city's Aviation Department — have been killed while working at the Austin airport.

Requests for more air traffic controllers at AUS

In addition to calls for new technology U.S. Reps. Lloyd Doggett and Greg Casar both Austin Democrats have asked the FAA to increase staffing levels for the Austin airport's air traffic controllers.

“This NTSB investigative file shows how very close we came to an alarming catastrophe with more than a hundred deaths. It shows our air traffic controllers are overworked overwhelmed and understaffed"" Doggett said in a statement Thursday. ""To assure our airport is safe we need more air traffic controllers sooner to relieve those currently subject to mandatory unsustainable six-day work weeks.""

As of September 2021 the FAA had 42 air traffic controllers stationed in the Austin airport's tower according to the FAA's 2022 air traffic controller workforce plan. At that time 35 were fully trained with the remaining seven listed as in training. The staffing range for Austin is 38 on the low end on up to 46 according to the plan.

Whether the FAA plans to change staffing levels is not clear. Mullooly did not respond to American-Statesman questions about staffing."

(NYSE:FIS) is about to go ex-dividend in just four days. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Therefore if you purchase Fidelity National Information Services' shares on or after the 7th of December you won't be eligible to receive the dividend when it is paid on the 22nd of December.

The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.52 per share and in the last 12 months the company paid a total of US$2.08 per share. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Fidelity National Information Services has a trailing yield of 3.5% on the current share price of $59.9. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.

See our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services

Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit then the dividend could be unsustainable. Fidelity National Information Services lost money last year so the fact that it's paying a dividend is certainly disconcerting. There might be a good reason for this but we'd want to look into it further before getting comfortable.

Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?

Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If earnings fall far enough the company could be forced to cut its dividend. Fidelity National Information Services reported a loss last year and the general trend suggests its earnings have also been declining in recent years making us wonder if the dividend is at risk.

The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Fidelity National Information Services has delivered an average of 9.0% per year annual increase in its dividend based on the past 10 years of dividend payments.

The Bottom Line

Is Fidelity National Information Services worth buying for its dividend? First it's not great to see the company paying a dividend despite being loss-making over the last year. Worse the general trend in its earnings looks negative in recent years. These characteristics don't generally lead to outstanding dividend performance and investors may not be happy with the results of owning this stock for its dividend.

Having said that if you're looking at this stock without much concern for the dividend you should still be familiar of the risks involved with Fidelity National Information Services. For example - Fidelity National Information Services has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.

(NYSE:FIS) stock was trading at $57.56 in the early hours of Nov. 29. Although the stock gained roughly 19% in the last month it is closer to the lower threshold of its 52-week price range — $46.91 to $79.32.

With a payout of $2.15 Fidelity's dividend yield is approximately 3.77%. Its 10-Q filing on Nov. 7 reported $926 million in dividend payments for the nine months from January to September. The payments have increased by $68 million or 8% compared to the same period in 2022.

How Can You Earn $500 Per Month As An FIS Investor?

Assuming your target is to make $500 per month — $6000 annually — from Fidelity National dividends you need to invest about $159151. At $57.56 a share this translates to holding about 2765 shares. But if you reduce your target to a moderate $100 per month the investment value is $31830 or 553 shares.

Estimating the investment value from dividend yields: Your investment value estimate can be derived using two key variables — the desired annual income of $6000 or $1200 — and the dividend yield of 3.77% for Fidelity National. The dividend yield is a percentage calculated by dividing the annual dividend payments by the market price of a stock.

To earn $500 per month your investment is close to $159151 ($6000 / 0.0377) and $ 31830 ($1200 / 0.0377) if you opt for a moderate $100 monthly income.

When estimating your investment value you should note that the dividend yield can change over time. This change can be attributed to the movement in stock prices as well as the dividend payments over time. These calculations have not considered the capital appreciation of a stock. If those are not factored into the capital appreciation the dividend value and its yield are positively correlated.

Assume a stock paying $2 as an annual dividend is trading at $50. The dividend yield would be $2/$50 or 4%. When the stock price jumps to $60 the dividend yield drops to $2/$60 or 3.33%. If the stock price falls to $40 this will trigger an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2/$40). As fluctuations in stock price impact the yield changes in the company's dividend policies also affect the yield.

In an SEC filing on Nov. 29 FNF reported that the company formally contained the incident on Nov. 26 and that it took measures to block access to the systems that disrupted its operations.

While ALPHV/BlackCat claimed responsibility for the attack in an X posting on Nov. 22 FNF has yet to confirm which group was responsible for the attack. Also the move by ALPHV/BlackCat to take FNF off its dark website the same day of the SEC filing could potentially indicate that a ransom was paid but this is also unconfirmed.

Rebecca Moody head of data research at Comparitech said if confirmed the attack on FNF will join 22 ransomware attacks on U.S. financial organizations this year alone. According to Comparitech’s U.S. ransomware tracker financial companies have had an average of 49000 records impacted per attack.

“ALPHV/BlackCat is responsible for the largest confirmed breach which was carried out on Progressive Leasing in September 2023 and affected 193055 records” said Moody. ""FNF will need to provide ongoing updates as to the scale of this attack whether it was indeed breached by ALPHV/BlackCat and whether not any data has been involved.""

Cyberattack on FNF described as 'catastrophe' in automated message

What’s fairly clear so far is that the attack disrupted FNF’s operations for some time. TechCrunch reported that one FNF subsidiary called the incident a “catastrophe” in an automated message played to anyone who called its customer support number. Some FNF subsidiaries reportedly did not have access to send or receive email or access to any system and asked customers to stay patient.

Callie Guenther senior manager of cyber threat research at Critical Start added that the attack on FNF appears to have been a ransomware incident as indicated by the involvement of the ALPHV/BlackCat ransomware group. Ransomware attacks typically consist of encrypting a victim's data and demanding payment for its release. Guenther said the fact that FNF's operations were severely disrupted suggests the attack was extensive affecting critical systems.

The attack's impact was widespread said Guenther affecting not only FNF but also its subsidiaries and customers: real estate transactions were frozen leading to confusion and uncertainty for individuals involved in buying selling or paying mortgages. This highlights the cascading effects that a cyberattack on a single entity can have across a network of interconnected businesses and customers explained Guenther.

“FNF's claim of having ‘contained’ the attack by Nov. 26 implies that they were able to halt the spread of the ransomware and begin restoration processes” said Guenther. “Containment is a critical step in incident response but it's just the beginning of a longer recovery process that often involves data recovery system repairs and strengthening cybersecurity measures. The disappearance of FNF's listing from the ransomware group’s website could imply that a ransom was paid although this is not confirmed.”

Andrew Barratt vice president at Coalfire said as an insurance services provider and a company that takes card payments for settlement and operating in regulated markets FNF will be subject to a raft of compliance obligations. Barratt added that the FNF website still appears inaccessible or unresponsive in some regions.

“FNF sounds like they’ve probably got an uphill struggle to resolve this completely leaving their customers and business partners probably wondering what’s going on” said Barratt. “They’ve filed an SEC event so this is a matter of public record now. The biggest surprise is that they haven’t got someone engaging with the media to advise their stakeholders how things are proceeding. There’s no shame in being a victim but not keeping all the stakeholders informed of the progress seems very short sighted.”

Anurag Gurtu CPO at StrikeReady called the FNF cyberattack a significant event especially considering the patterns of groups like ALPHV/BlackCat known for targeting major financial institutions. Gurtu said ALPHV/BlackCat's focus on high-value targets like MGM and now Fidelity indicates a strategic shift in ransomware attacks towards organizations with substantial financial resources and critical data.

“This tactic not only maximizes potential ransom returns but also inflicts considerable operational disruption” said Gurtu. “Financial institutions must therefore prioritize advanced cybersecurity measures understanding that their size and importance makes them attractive targets for sophisticated cybercriminal groups. This trend necessitates a proactive approach in cybersecurity emphasizing the need for continuous monitoring incident response preparedness and employee training in cybersecurity best practices.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy9zdG9jay1tYXJrZXQvbWFya2V0LXNlY3RvcnMvZmluYW5jaWFscy9maW50ZWNoLXN0b2Nrcy9hcmUtZmludGVjaC1zdG9ja3Mtc2FmZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Fintech Safe for Investing? Risks of Investing in the Industry,"Fintech stocks are typically high-growth companies that are investing heavily in disruptive technologies and as a whole they aren't the safest places to put your money. That said just as with any other sector or subsector of the stock market there is a wide range of risk when it comes to fintech stocks. And even for those that would be considered risky the long-term return potential can certainly justify the risks. Some fintech stocks are among the most rock-solid companies in the world and could be considered very safe stocks while others are high-growth stocks with tremendous return potential but also with a lot that could go wrong. With that in mind here's a rundown of some of the key factors to consider from a safety perspective when evaluating fintech stocks for your portfolio.

Sales growth Sales growth One thing I look for in every fintech stock I consider is how fast it's growing revenue (or sales). It's important not only to look for excellent growth in the current quarter or fiscal year but also to look for an established and consistent track record of growth. In addition it's important to be sure there's plenty of room for the growth rate to be sustained. As an example if a company has $1 billion in annual sales and grew its revenue by 30% last year I'd be more excited if the overall market size were $50 billion than I would if it were $3 billion. Balance sheet and profitability Balance sheet and profitability Does the company you're studying have a substantial debt burden on its balance sheet or is it cash-rich? A rock-solid balance sheet with more cash than debt can significantly reduce the risk involved with an investment -- even more so if the company is profitable. In the fintech industry there are many companies that aren't yet profitable. And that's OK provided that they're growing and have a clear path to profitability. For example Square (SQ 2.27%) isn't consistently profitable yet but with the stock recently soaring to all-time highs nobody seems to care. Why? Square is expanding its business so rapidly quarter after quarter that investors are perfectly happy with the company's decision to reinvest aggressively in its business. Consistent profitability certainly adds to the safety of a stock. This is why I'd put a consistently profitable company such as American Express (AXP 0.81%) in a lower risk tier than Square. Competition Competition Is the fintech company you're considering the leader in its business or does it compete with larger players? Is the industry large and fragmented or do just a few companies dominate the market? Competitive risk is one of the main factors affecting the safety of any stock including fintechs. As an example consider Visa (V -1.63%) and Mastercard (MA -1.14%). They aren't just the leaders in payment processing the two of them dominate the space. On the other hand newly public insurance tech company Lemonade (LMND 1.48%) participates in a highly competitive industry with lots of much larger players.

Competitive advantages Competitive advantages On a similar note a durable competitive advantage (or several) can help level the playing field between large established companies and small disruptive fintechs. Competitive advantages come in several forms. Maybe a company has pricing power over its rivals or a brand name that is widely trusted and helps sell its product. As an example of the latter consider how PayPal (PYPL 0.83%) has become nearly synonymous with ""online payments."" This creates a huge barrier for would-be competitors. In the fintech space common competitive advantages also include such things as proprietary technology patents and other intellectual property. I mentioned insurance tech company Lemonade in the previous section; although it's small and in a crowded industry the company has an artificial intelligence quote platform superior to what's currently on the market. Cyclicality Cyclicality Cyclicality refers to how sensitive an industry or business is to recessions and other economic fluctuations. As an example a hotel is a cyclical business since fewer people travel when times are tough. On the other hand healthcare is not a cyclical business because people need access to healthcare services no matter what the economy is doing. Some fintech companies are quite cyclical. For example not only do credit card issuers such as American Express and Discover Financial Services (DFS 0.21%) rely on the ability and willingness of consumers and businesses to spend money but during recessions more people tend to have trouble paying their bills. On the other hand payment processors such as Visa and Mastercard are somewhat less cyclical because while they rely on fee income from spending they are not lenders and don't have as much default risk.

The network effect The network effect What is the No. 1 reason people join social media sites such as Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR)? It's because other people they are interested in are already on the platform. This is a basic explanation of a phenomenon known as the network effect and this also applies to some fintech stocks. As an example Square's Cash App allows users to seamlessly send and receive money from people they know. As more people sign up for the Cash App over time the platform becomes even more attractive to those not already on it. In other words Cash App is a much more useful platform now that it has 30 million active users than it was with 7 million users at the end of 2017. Many people couldn't bear the thought of deleting their Facebook page and the same can be said for their Cash App and Venmo accounts. This effect provides a competitive advantage that adds to the safety of the companies that operate these platforms. The bottom line on fintech stock risk When investing in stocks regardless of the sector or subsector of the market it wouldn't be fair to label all fintech stocks as either safe or risky. This is especially true in the fintech space where companies cover such a broad range of business models and you should therefore evaluate each stock's relative safety level individually using the criteria discussed here.

The Jacksonville-based company notified investors about the issue on Nov. 19 according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Fidelity reported by Inman and contained it exactly a week later.

FNF said the incident impacted systems but has not detailed further. The company said it had to block access to certain systems to contain the incident resulting in disruptions to the company’s title insurance escrow and mortgage transaction services.

The impact on customers remains unclear as the company has only said it was coordinating with them as normal business operations resume. Outside of the core services FNF also provides technology to real estate and mortgage companies and facilitates mortgage loans mortgage loan subservicing and 1031 exchanges through various subsidiaries.

Speculation online has suggested FNF was attacked by a ransomware group. ALPHV has claimed responsibility for a cyberattack on FNF according to The Register. If FNF was subject to such an attack it may have paid ransom to recover its systems but it’s unclear if FNF did so.

The company has not responded to requests for comment from Inman and other media outlets. FNF is the nation’s largest title insurer responsible for 31 percent of the country’s title business in 2020.

The FNF incident did affect home sales in the Chicago area. Real estate agents and attorneys reported delays of varying lengths in closing deals due to the cybersecurity incident.

Cyberattacks are emerging as a more regular threat to the real estate industry. Last month mortgage lender Mr. Cooper shut down several systems that left customers unable to make mortgage and loan payments. The company was sued following the attack which left customer information compromised according to HousingWire.

According to court documents Tracy Phillips a West Virginia resident says Target is partially at fault for the death of his son Alias Phillips.

Police responded to the store on Grier Drive just before 1 p.m. on March 17 2022 and found 24-year-old Alias Phillips shot to death. After the shooting his brother and sister who were with him at the time said a man yelled at them and followed them before they entered the Target. That man was then waiting with a gun when they left said and chased Alias Phillips down before shooting him they said.

Alias Phillips' siblings also said their brother was a Schroder High School graduate working to build a career as a recording artist.

A Cincinnnati Fire Department official said it was the largest police presence he had seen since the 2018 mass shooting at Fifth Third Bank. Initially the shooting was dispatched as an active shooter situation. However then-interim police chief Teresa Theetge said the victim was targeted and that there was no active shooter situation.

Anthony McIntosh 23 was arrested for the shooting. Earlier this year he pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter as well as another charge. He was sentenced to more than 20 years in prison.

Tracy Phillips is alleging that Target security failed to intervene inside of the store when his son was confronted with hostile intent and a gun was revealed according to court documents.

""Target was partially at fault for the death of Alias Phillips for the lack of store security and monitoring which could have prevented the outcome if security would have intervened"" according to court documents.

On top of the $50 million in damages Tracy Phillips is also seeking an apology from Target."

In the plan a float line at the Pilkington North America Rossford location a member of NSG Group will install online coating capacity and will start shipping TCO glass for solar panel manufacture in the first quarter of calendar year 2025.

The upgraded float line in Rossford will support the expansion strategy of First Solar the largest solar manufacturer in the U.S. and a global provider of responsibly produced eco-efficient solar modules which has a long-standing strategic partnership with NSG Group. The float line will supply glass to First Solar’s manufacturing footprint in the U.S. which is forecast to grow to 14 gigawatts of annual nameplate capacity by 2026.

To meet the growing global demand for solar panels specifically First Solar NSG Group started operation of the second dedicated float line for solar glass in Vietnam in January 2020 and a new plant in Luckey has been operating since November 2020. The conversion of another NSG group float line in Johor Bahru was recently completed and is now beginning production. The glass produced in these plants is exclusively supplied to First Solar and will bring the total of lines dedicated to First Solar production to five.

NSG Group continues to consider expanding capacity for solar energy glass to ensure it meets First Solar demand.

This project further supports NSG’s ongoing efforts to reduce the amount of carbon in the environment by enabling additional clean solar energy generated by First Solar’s solar panels.

The Group will continue its efforts to realize its Medium-Term Vision to be “A global glass supplier contributing to the world with high value-added glass products and services.”

Challenges in the Solar Industry

Despite sustained demand for photovoltaic modules storm clouds have recently shadowed the solar industry. The Invesco Solar ETF a key indicator of the sector’s performance has shed 43% of its value marking a downtrend that began in August 2022. This decline reflects numerous and complex factors in this renewable energy sector:

Declining prices : The sector has been grappling with declining prices due to oversupply which has led to tighter profit margins and concerns over industry overcapacity.

Interest rates : As elsewhere in the economy rising interest rates which have stabilized for now have played a role making financing more expensive and affecting investor sentiment.

Lower polysilicon costs : Lower material costs are frequently a boon for manufacturers since they cut a major expense. Polysilicon is the primary raw material used to produce solar panels and global spot prices for it declined about 70% earlier this year reaching $8 per kilogram for the first time in three years. This caused global module prices to reach their lowest-ever point at $0.17 per watt produced due to oversupply competition decreasing module commodity prices (silver aluminum etc.) and a decline in the value of the Chinese yuan versus the dollar. However this was not necessarily good for solar stocks since many solar companies had a good amount of polysilicon in inventory which lost much of its value.

Advantages of Investing in Solar Stocks

Growing investments in renewal energy: Billions in investments from the U.S. federal government aim to make the use of solar more universal for energy needs. In 2018 another dollar went to renewable energy sources for every dollar invested in fossil fuel production. As of 2023 that ratio is now one dollar on fossil fuels for every $1.70 spent on clean energy. This reduces energy producers' most significant costs namely those for the infrastructure that makes it possible. The sun's energy of course has no cost so this should mean reduced costs for solar production firms. As those expenses go lower the cost of solar energy should become more competitive with other energy sources lowering the price consumers pay for each watt of power.

Growing renewable energy demand: Solar stocks should benefit from increasing global demand for renewable energy sources. Growing investment and demand for solar energy translates directly into increased demand for solar technology and infrastructure bolstering the prospects of companies within the sector.

Decreasing costs and technological advances: Solar stocks stand to benefit from solar technology cost reductions and new technological advances in the sector. The U.S. Department of Energy continues with plans to reduce the cost of solar energy by 60% by 2030. The drop in global polysilicon spot prices should mean reduced costs for solar panel manufacturers increase their overall profitability and improve their ability to compete with other forms of energy generation as the cost per watt produced goes down.

Working with J.P. Morgan Bank of America Morgan Stanley Renewables Inc. and Truist Bank SB Energy has closed approximately US$800 million in tax equity and working with seven other financial institutions (MUFG Mizuho Americas ING SMBC CIBC Fifth Third Bank and Société Générale) raised US$450 million in term debt and US$1.2 billion in construction debt to support a 1.3 GW portfolio of four utility scale solar projects.

Since its inception SB Energy has been committed to growing domestic clean energy deployment and the US supply chain. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is further catalysing the US clean energy industry through expansion of tax credits and new approaches to tax equity including transferability that SB Energy continues to explore. Overall SB Energy is proud to support over 3600 new direct and supply chain jobs across the four projects all located in energy communities that have seen higher than average unemployment rates due to recent coal closures or fossil fuel retirements.

Three of the projects are also the first utility scale projects in the US to reach financial close with the ‘domestic content adder’ a provision in the IRA designed to strengthen America’s manufacturing base and the good-paying jobs that support it. To qualify for the domestic content adder SB Energy is utilising 1.1 million high domestic content solar modules manufactured in Ohio by First Solar. Additionally Nextracker is supplying trackers with recently expanded component providers in multiple US states including Pennsylvania Nevada and Tennessee among others. All structural steel on these same projects will use domestically sourced steel from Texas and Georgia. SB Energy will continue to lead in partnering with domestic manufacturers to onshore more of the clean energy supply chain.

Rich Hossfeld SB Energy Co-CEO said: “The IRA’s domestic content and energy community incentives were designed to expand America’s manufacturing base and create good-paying jobs in communities that need them. We are thrilled to be the first company to reach financial close on projects that utilise these adders with our partners J.P. Morgan Chase Bank of America Morgan Stanley Renewables Inc. and Truist Bank. SB Energy commends our tax equity partners for their industry leadership in clean energy deployment and supporting American workers.”

Rubiao Song Managing Director and Head of Energy Tax Equity Investments at J.P. Morgan added: “J.P. Morgan is one of the largest providers of financing including tax equity to clean energy. We are excited to work with SB Energy on their latest project to support American clean energy transition and job growth.”

Todd Karas Head of Renewable Energy Finance at Bank of America commented: “We are pleased to work with SB Energy again and support their important mission to drive the growth of American jobs in communities that have long contributed to our country’s energy growth and now in a sustainable way.”

Jorge Iragorri Head of Renewable Energy Investments at Morgan Stanley stat-ed: “In just over a year since the passage of the IRA American workers are realising the benefits of new clean energy projects. We are excited to help lead in partnership with SB Energy the industry in continuing to decarbonise the electric grid.”

Andrew Rosenbaum Head of Truist Securities’ Power and Renewables Group exclaimed: “We are proud to have executed a considerable number of strategic advisory and financing transactions in the renewable energy sector during the second half of this year delivering on our energy transition objectives and bringing reliable cost-efficient energy to customers. We are delighted to support our partner SB Energy on their first-of-a-kind solar project.”

Google is purchasing approximately 75% of the energy produced by these four projects to power a growing data centre presence in Texas. Google recently announced it will invest US$330 million this year in the state that includes beginning construction on a new data centre in Red Oak.

J.P. Morgan Bank of America Morgan Stanley Renewables Inc. and Truist Bank provided the tax equity for the Orion I Eiffel Orion II and Orion III projects respectively. MUFG is the lead lender on the Eiffel and Orion II projects while Mizuho Americas is the lead lender on Orion I and III. Other lenders for the projects are ING SMBC CIBC Fifth Third Bank and Société Générale.

“By partnering with leading tax equity investors and lenders on these latest financings we are extending our track record of deploying renewable generation at scale. Moreover by utilising the IRA’s domestic content and energy community adders we have created a blueprint for deploying clean infrastructure that advances America’s prosperity and wellbeing” concluded Gianluca Signorelli SB Energy Head of Capital Markets.

The UP Expressway Industrial Development Authority (UPEIDA) is hammering out the blueprint of the project which is aimed at making the Bundelkhand Expressway India’s first solar-powered expressway.

Companies such as Torrent Power have evinced interest in the 550 megawatt (Mw) project which will soon witness competitive bidding to select the private developer under the public-private partnership (PPP) model.

“The use of solar energy to illuminate the expressway as well as 100000 nearby houses will cut down on carbon emissions and save on the energy costs” a senior state government official said.

The expected lifespan of the project is 25 years with a payback period set at 10-12 years. The prospective bidders who have given their presentations include Tusco Torrent Power Somaya Solar Solutions 3R Management Avaada Energy. Atria Brindavan Power Erisha E Mobility and Mahapreit.

The solar project will cater to the energy needs of the houses along the expressway and serve as a foundation for e-mobility and local socioeconomic development.

UP is looking at powering other expressways in the state including Purvanchal Expressway Agra-Lucknow Expressway Gorakhpur Link Expressway etc. with solar energy for promoting green and renewable energy and to bolster the e-vehicle charging infrastructure.

The Yogi Adityanath government is vigourously ramping up power generation capacity to meet the growing energy demand from different segments of consumers including domestic industry commercial and agriculture.

The government is setting up brownfield and greenfield solar and thermal energy projects across the state in the backdrop of peak hour energy demand breaching the 28000 Mw mark.

Also the state is in the process of inviting solar energy bids of 7000 Mw in two phases. The government targets 25000 Mw of solar energy generation in the long term.

Meanwhile the UP Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC) has amended the Rooftop Solar Power Regulations 2019 to promote solar energy allowing the net metering facility to government and private educational institutions.

The amendment is likely to benefit about 200000 power consumers and improve the viability of educational institutions."

It comes almost five months after Republican former House Speaker Larry Householder went to prison in the criminal case surrounding that law.

FirstEnergy investors including investment and pension funds are suing over losses they took after news broke about the $60 million bribery scheme in June 2020 when the company's stock dropped 40%.

Gov. Mike DeWine has received a subpoena for documents related to any communications he might have had with former Public Utilities Commission of Ohio chair Sam Randazzo who was appointed to that position by DeWine a few months before HB 6 was signed into law in July 2019. FirstEnergy admitted to bribing Householder and Randazzo in a deferred prosecution agreement in the HB 6 case in July 2021. Randazzo's Columbus home was searched by the FBI in November 2020 but he has never been charged.

Lt. Gov. Jon Husted received a similar subpoena and is set for a deposition between Feb. 28 and Mar. 19.

""I would say a great deal of this information is already out. It is out in requests that we've received either from somebody in the news media or someone else to supply information"" DeWine said when asked by reporters about the subpoena he received. “It’s a civil suit. We are not a party to the suit. But a subpoena has been issued for information we might have.""

Attorney General Dave Yost added the request is to provide facts for a case and pushed back on a question about whether DeWine could be added to the suit.

""The bottom line is anybody can sue for anything with a sheet of paper and $150. This is America. That's the way it works"" Yost said. ""I just I don't think that that's an appropriate thing for us to talk about. The governor and the lieutenant governor have been subpoenaed in a civil suit as fact witnesses. And you could be subpoenaed in as a fact witness in a lawsuit and you don't have anything to say about it.""

Husted's spokesperson said in a written statement: “The Lt. Governor has already provided public records pertaining to this and we will continue to comply as we have done in the past. There’s no new information to disclose.""

Householder was convicted of racketeering and was sentenced to 20 years in prison in June. Former Ohio Republican Party chair Matt Borges is serving five years in prison for his role in the scheme called the largest corruption scandal in state history.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYnNuZXdzLmNvbS9waXR0c2J1cmdoL25ld3MvZG9jdW1lbnRzLW9mLW9oaW8tZ292LW1pa2UtZGV3aW5lLWFuZC1saWV1dGVuYW50LWdvdmVybm9yLXN1YnBvZW5hZWQtaW4tbGF3c3VpdC1vdmVyLWJyaWJlcnktc2NoZW1lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Documents of Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine and lieutenant governor subpoenaed in lawsuit over bribery scheme,"COLUMBUS Ohio (AP) — Ohio's governor and lieutenant governor have been drawn into a FirstEnergy Corp. investors lawsuit connected to the $60 million bribery scheme concocted by the Akron-based energy giant and a now-incarcerated House speaker.

Republican Gov. Mike DeWine received a subpoena for documents in the case dated Nov. 17 according to a copy provided to The Associated Press by his office on Tuesday and first reported by cleveland.com. His spokesperson Dan Tierney said the governor's lawyers are reviewing the order.

It seeks any communications DeWine might have had with FirstEnergy executives named in the lawsuit or Sam Randazzo the state's former top utility regulator that related to former House Speaker Larry Householder's efforts to secure power to the tainted $1 billion nuclear bailout legislation Householder championed in exchange for the bribes and to a host of other related topics.

Lt. Gov. Jon Husted also a Republican received a similar subpoena on the same date - and according to a court filing Monday is scheduled to be deposed in the case sometime between Feb. 28 and March 19.

""We're aware of the civil investor lawsuit against FirstEnergy"" Husted spokesperson Hayley Carducci said in an email. ""The Lt. Governor has already provided public records pertaining to this and we will continue to comply as we have done in the past. There's no new information to disclose.""

The civil lawsuit is distinct from a separate ongoing criminal case in which Householder lobbyist Matt Borges and two others have been convicted. A fifth man charged died by suicide in 2021. Householder was sentenced to 20 years in prison and Borges received five.

Tierney said no one in the DeWine administration has ever been subpoenaed or identified as under investigation in the criminal probe.

Nor has Randazzo the governor's pick for the powerful chairmanship of the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio whose Columbus townhome was searched by the FBI in November 2020.

As chair of the commission Randazzo held immense sway over the fortunes of FirstEnergy and other investor-owned utilities.

During his confirmation hearing for the job he testified before a state Senate committee that he was asked before DeWine and Husted took office on Jan. 14 2019 to forgo plans to retire to Naples Florida where he owned an expensive waterfront home and to return to government at the utility commission.

He specified during the confirmation hearing that Husted and Laurel Dawson DeWine's then-chief of staff were among those who helped recruit him. DeWine disregarded cries of alarm from consumer and environmental advocates at the time as well as pleas from GOP insiders concerned about Randazzo's selection the AP first reported in December 2020.

When he was Ohio House speaker in 2007 Husted appointed Randazzo to the Public Utilities Commission Nominating Council and the two were allies in thwarting renewable and alternative energy mandates proposed by then-Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland and opposed by a coalition of utilities led by FirstEnergy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YWRpdW1qb3VybmV5LmNvbS9zdGFkaXVtcy9maXJzdGVuZXJneS1zdGFkaXVtLXM3MNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cleveland Browns Stadium - Cleveland Browns,"

Stadium Info FANFARE Score: 3.86

FirstEnergy Stadium 100 Alfred Lerner Way Cleveland OH 44114

Year Opened: 1999 Capacity: 67407









The Dawg Pound





It is difficult to argue that there is an NFL fanbase that has endured more heartache than the Cleveland Browns. Founded in 1946 and named after legendary coach Paul Brown the Browns more than any other NFL team would hold steadfast to their traditions. Success came early for the Browns with four AAFC championships and four NFL championships all before the Super Bowl era ending in 1964.





Outside of Paul Brown legendary running back Jim Brown has captured the hearts of Clevleanders. However with the purchase of the browns by Art Modell in 1953 the decline of the Browns would begin. Modell famously fired Paul Brown in 1963 and an ostracized Jim Brown abruptly retired in 1965. The Browns would come close to the successes they enjoyed in the forties and fifties with the Kardiac Kids of the late seventies and a pair of heartbreaking close calls for quarterback Bernie Kosar in the late eighties with trips to the Super Bowl thwarted by “The Drive” and “The Fumble.”





With other professional teams in Cleveland gaining new facilities in the nineties the Browns were left with decrepit massive Cleveland Stadium owner Art Modell moved the Browns to Baltimore to become the Ravens in 1995. The NFL immediately recognized the value of the Cleveland market and the steadfast loyalty of the fanbase and announced an expansion team to be granted to Cleveland for the 1999 season.





The lynchpin to the Browns expansion team which would retail all records trademarks and championships was the building of Cleveland Browns Stadium. New Browns owner Art Lerner would see his team take the field in the 1999 season in the new stadium owned by the City of Cleveland with a capacity of over 67000. The new Browns have not enjoyed much success in the past 23 years. Al Lerner died in 2002. The Lerner Family sold the Browns to Jimmy and Dee Haslam in 2012 and they remain current owners of the team. To go along with a lack of success the Browns are most known for one of the most recognizable fan groups in the entire NFL the Dawg Pound.





Food & Beverage 4

As with any major sports venue concessions are at the front of the consciousness of the team. The Browns offer concession options that are on par with other major sports venues. Some options include the Burger Kitchen Tenders Love & Chicken C-Town Eats Michael Symon’s B-Spot Here We Go Nachos Meat and Cleaver and Great Lakes Cheesesteaks.





All of the expected stadium items can be found along with some items that will peak the interest of those looking for something more. The unique options at Great Lakes Cheesesteaks are one of the best choices which include Cleveland Nachos (nachos with parmesan fondue green onions bacon and thyme) and the local favorite Polish Boy a brat topped with coleslaw BBQ sauce fries and crispy onions.





Cleveland Browns Stadium has a large selection of beer in multiple bar areas. Goose Island Beware of the Dawg may be the choice. A curious feature of beverages at Cleveland Browns Stadium is the lack of Coke or Pepsi. RC Cola 7Up and Dr. Pepper make up the soft drink selections.





Atmosphere 4





The exterior of Cleveland is an attractive almost modern-looking silver/chrome siding with plenty of glass. There are plenty of huge player banners that hang from the exterior for fans to see as well. For many years Cleveland Browns Stadium was known under the corporate name FirstEnergy Stadium. For the 2023 season the name has reverted to Cleveland Browns Stadium.





It is obvious that the Browns and/or the City of Cleveland are looking for a new corporate partner for stadium naming rights as there is little to no signage on the exterior that says “Cleveland Browns Stadium.” The Cleveland Browns Hall of Fame can be found on plaques on the exterior of the stadium along Alfred Lerner Way the hub of pregame activity before a Browns game. Two spots fans will assuredly want to see before entering the gates are the Otto Graham statue in the southwest corner of the stadium and the Jim Brown statue in the southeast corner of the stadium.





Entering Cleveland Browns Stadium brings fans into the main concourses which are fairly spacious and have plenty of orange highlights to give color to the otherwise dark breezeways. Several banners are honoring Browns players who are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Other highlights include a Joe Thomas mural honoring his 10363 consecutive snaps played in the NFL.





Inside the seating area fans will find the three tiers of seating around the field which runs from west to east. The lower bowl is continuous with separated second and third tiers. The south side is the spot to get that perfect center logo picture which for the 2023 season was Brownie the Elf. The fascia of the third deck is where the Browns showcase their highest honors. The 1946 1947 1948 1949 1950 1954 1955 and 1964 championships are listed in the southeast corner.





The rest of the fascia notes the members of the Browns Ring of Honour including Paul Brown Frank Gatski Leroy Kelly Bobby Mitchell Joe DeLamielleure Mike McCormack Lou Grozaand new for the 2023 season and Joe Thomas. Each end of the stadium features large videoboards which are crystal clear. The other main attraction at Cleveland Browns Stadium is in the lower bowl behind the east endzone The Dawg Pound the preeminent team supporter section in the NFL is found there and has found a bit of a life of its own.





The gameday production at a Browns game is as good as any in the NFL. In the pregame the Browns enter from the northwest corner through some bulldog statues with gates. The requisite pyro and smoke machine along with flagbearers and cheerleaders are part of the entry. In the pregame a guest takes a guitar painted in the fashion of the visiting team and smashes it against a podium to the delight of the 65000 fans in attendance. The Browns mascots Chomps and Brownie can be found throughout the stadium interacting with fans.









Neighborhood 5

Despite what seems like a popular narrative Downtown Cleveland is one of the most underrated areas in the country. Cleveland Browns Stadium is located on the lakeshore on the northwest side of Downtown Cleveland. There are a ton of options for pre or postgame fare for those who are not tailgating. Some options include Nuevo Modern Mexican & Tequila Bar Masthead Brewing Co. Harry Buffalo Margaritaville Leather Stallion and the Winking Lizard.





For fans looking for other sporting options there are plenty. Just up the road at Progressive Field fans can find the Cleveland Guardians of MLB. Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse is shared by the Cleveland Cavaliers of the NBA and Cleveland Monsters of the AHL. College basketball is also not that far away from the Cleveland State Vikings. There are also plenty of tourist options that are not based on sports including the Great Lakes Science Center USS COD International Women’s Air & Space Museum and the must-see Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. For fans wishing to stay near the stadium the Hilton Cleveland Downtown Cleveland Marriott Downtown and Doubletree Cleveland Downtown are all close by.





Fans 5

Cleveland Browns fans are among the most ardent and loyal in all of sports. In the 2022 and 2023 seasons the Browns have averaged more than 67000 fans per game. Although that ranks the 19th and 20th in the NFL in 2022 and 2023 respectively that does account for 100% of the capacity. Browns fans are loud and proud and show up regardless of the weather conditions which should not be underestimated. The Dawg Pound is also the most famous fan area in the NFL.

Access 4

Getting to Cleveland Browns Stadium is not difficult for a downtown stadium. Cleveland Browns Stadium is located along Lake Erie on the northwest side of Downtown Cleveland. Cleveland Browns Stadium is surrounded by 3rd Street Alfred Lerner Way and Erieside Ave with Lake Erie just beyond to the north.





The stadium is north of Cleveland Memorial Shoreway and north and west of I-90 so fans will have to traverse the city a bit when coming from out of town. There are plenty of parking options with the Pier to the north and plenty of downtown garages. The best option is to use a parking app and prepay for parking to ensure a spot. For fans who wish to take public transit to the game there are a few options. The rapid transit and Amtrack and buses are found to the south. Fans should check out the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority website for fares maps and schedules.





Getting around Cleveland Browns Stadium is not too difficult and washroom facilities are decent. With security protocols in professional sports consistently changing Stadium Journey recommends fans consult the Cleveland Browns website for the most up-to-date security protocols including prohibited items.









Return on Investment 3

The Cleveland Browns are not a cheap experience as are all NFL experiences. According to the Fan Cost Index the Browns are the 17th most expensive experience in the NFL at $593 above the NFL average. Tickets for the Browns begin at $70 and go up to $294 for the lower sidelines. Dawg Pound seats are $189. Concessions are what one would expect for the NFL and parking is going to go for over $20 for sure. Although the return that the Browns give the fans is solid the steep investment is difficult to get over as is the case for all NFL experiences





Extras 2

An extra mark for the Dawg Pound a revolutionary fan experience that began at Panorama at the grassroots and has been copied throughout the NFL.





An extra mark for the perseverance of the Browns fans as they have struggled with many seasons of non-competitive teams since the team’s return in 1999.





Final Thoughts

The Cleveland Browns are a solid NFL experience at Cleveland Browns Stadium. Being part of a fanbase that is as ardent passionate and loyal as any in the NFL is an attractive part of the Browns experience. Cleveland is also a great tourist destination and fans will enjoy making a full weekend of it.

What to Know

The Hawks and the Bucks are an even 5-5 against one another since July of 2021 but not for long. The Atlanta Hawks' road trip will continue as they head out to face the Milwaukee Bucks at 8:00 p.m. ET on December 2nd at Fiserv Forum. The Bucks took a loss in their last contest and will be looking to turn the tables on the Hawks who come in off a win.

The oddsmakers set the bar high but the Hawks and the Spurs didn't disappoint and broke past the 246 point over/under on Thursday. Atlanta skirted past San Antonio 137-135. The victory was just what the Hawks needed coming off of a 128-105 loss in their prior match.

Trae Young was on fire: he dropped a double-double on 45 points and 14 assists. Dejounte Murray was another key contributor scoring 24 points along with 5 steals.

Meanwhile the Bucks unfortunately witnessed the end of their three-game winning streak on Thursday. They took a 120-113 hit to the loss column at the hands of Chicago. The Bucks didn't live up to their potential and found themselves falling short of the advantage oddsmakers thought they had coming into the game.

Giannis Antetokounmpo put forth a good effort for the losing side as he dropped a double-double on 26 points and 14 rebounds. He is on a roll when it comes to rebounds as he's now pulled down ten or more in the last three games he's played.

The losses dropped Atlanta to 9-9 and San Antonio to 3-15.

While only the Bucks took care of their fans the last time they played neither team managed to cover. Looking ahead to Saturday the Bucks are the favorite in this one as the experts expect to see them win by 6.5 points. Against the spread they have been a house darling this year with a chancy 7-12 ATS record.

Some high-performance offense is likely on the agenda as Atlanta and Milwaukee are some of the highest scoring teams in the league. The Hawks haven't had any problem running up the score this season having averaged 123.3 points per game (they're ranked second in scoring overall). However it's not like the Bucks (currently ranked third in scoring) struggle in that department as they've been averaging 120.5 per game. With both teams so easily able to put up points the only question left is who can run up the score up higher Check CBS Sports after the match for a full breakdown of the game commentary and other NBA content.

Bobby Portis’ 13 points in the first quarter were a massive spark for the Bucks. Khris Middleton aided the efforts in the opening frame with ten of his own while Giannis chipped in with nine. All of that resulted in the Bucks getting a 42-37 lead after one.

Hot shooting for both teams continued throughout the second quarter. Trae Young led all scorers through two stanzas at 20 points. At halftime Milwaukee held a 67-63 lead.

That fast-paced scoring? It continued to remain the theme for both teams throughout the third. A near buzzer-beating arched shot from Bogdan Bogdanovic made it 99-98 Milwaukee going into the final quarter of regulation.

According to The Wall Street Journal Bed Bath & Beyond wants MSC to pay roughly $150 million for damages as well as an equal sum for what the company described as exploitative and coercive behavior.

The lawsuit claims that MSC’s performance in 2021 was “abysmal.” The lawsuit also said that MSC failed to meet contractual obligations in terms of pricing while saddling the retailer with surcharges. “MSC’s behavior has caused significant harm” the complaint said.

MSC said that it is studying the complaint but believes that the claims have no merit.

“MSC is proud of its efforts to provide its customers with continued service during a time of extraordinary market conditions” a spokesperson said.

Bed Bath & Beyond previously made similar claims against the Taiwanese company Yang Ming Marine Transport as well as OOCL. However the organization claimed much smaller damages against those companies.

This guide concentrates on Solanum ptycanthum (eastern black nightshade). We reached out to pathologists to learn how to spot and treat this disease. For this installment our contributor is Dwight Lingenfelter of Penn State University Extension.

The Basics

Advertisement

Scientific name: Solanum ptycanthum

Geographical range: This is a widespread problem. While eastern black nightshade dominates in the eastern part of the country black nightshade (Solanum nigrum) is typically a problem in the western part of the country.

Crops affected: Many crops are impacted but it is most problematic with crops in the Solanaceae family such as peppers tomatoes vine crops and pumpkins because nightshade also is a member of this plant family. The juices from eastern black nightshade berries also can seep into soybean seeds during harvest staining the beans and reducing the overall quality of the commodity.

The Weed’s Impact

Lingenfelter: Eastern black nightshade is an annual. It grows year to year from seed. Any weed that has a large population can cause pressure in a plant system because it competes with the crop for resources such as sunlight and nutrients.

Based on an informal survey I conducted of county educators in horticulture nightshade was a nuisance for growers of peppers tomatoes pumpkins and a few other crops. It can be a serious problem for some vegetable growers. On tomatoes for example it is hard to control because there are very few products that have activity on nightshade.

How to ID the Weed

Lingenfelter: Eastern black nightshade can be mistaken for some of the pigweed varieties such as redroot pigweed or tumble pigweed especially at young stages in the life cycle.

One of the things that helps differentiate black nightshade from pigweed is that pigweed typically has a notch in its first true leaf. Nightshade’s first true leaf typically comes to a point.

All parts of the plant are considered toxic; however the green leaves stems and seeds are especially toxic. The green fruit may be quite poisonous while the ripe fruit may be relatively nontoxic; this could have an impact on fresh market crops or forages.

Recommended Treatment

Lingenfelter: Stopping seed production is the key to managing annual weeds like Eastern black nightshade. Weed management is most successful when it involves an integrated approach using a variety of tactics including prevention (e.g. control weeds around the farmstead field edges roadside) cultural (e.g. selecting best crop varieties maintaining proper soil fertility increasing crop competition planting dense seedlings adjusting planting date routine field scouting rotating crops including cover crops) mechanical (e.g. mowing plowing cultivating mulching with plastic or natural row covers) and chemical.

In most cases chemical control or the use of herbicides is the backbone of many weed management systems. However it is critical to include cultural and mechanical control tactics whenever possible. Obviously some methods won’t work and others won’t be suitable for certain settings so select or supplement the tactics that are most appropriate.

Many herbicides that would kill nightshade would also injure the crop. The lack of effective herbicides is a key problem.

Herbicidal Considerations

One of the problems with many traditional herbicides is that they are only labeled for certain crops or in certain parts of the country. Lingenfelter says to make sure to refer to herbicide label for speciﬁc use guidelines. Here are some typical options but others might exist.

Authority/Spartan (FMC Corp.)

Use: For pre-emergence and pre-plant in tomatoes and agronomic crops like soybeans.

Active ingredient: Sulfentrazone

WSSA Group: 14

Additional Info: Approximately 85% to 90% effective.

Use: Weed control in pumpkins tomatoes and several other crops

Active ingredient: S-metolachlor

WSSA Group: 15

Additional Info: Provides about 75% to 80% control of less severe nightshade infestations.

Use: Pre- and post-emergence control of weeds

Active Ingredient: Fomesafen

WSSA Group: 14

Additional Info: Approximately 80% effective. Labeled for use in the Mid-Atlantic states on certain crops (e.g. pumpkins/vines snap beans peppers potatoes).

The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months increasing to US$12.64 at one point and dropping to the lows of US$9.70. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Ford Motor's current trading price of US$10.58 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Ford Motor’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.

View our latest analysis for Ford Motor

Is Ford Motor Still Cheap?

According to my valuation model Ford Motor seems to be fairly priced at around 13% below my intrinsic value which means if you buy Ford Motor today you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $12.12 then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Ford Motor’s share price is quite volatile we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.

Can we expect growth from Ford Motor?

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Ford Motor's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows feeding into a higher share value.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in F’s positive outlook with shares trading around its fair value. However there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on F now may not be the most advantageous time to buy given it is trading around its fair value. However the positive outlook is encouraging for the company which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

Story continues

So while earnings quality is important it's equally important to consider the risks facing Ford Motor at this point in time. When we did our research we found 3 warning signs for Ford Motor (1 can't be ignored!) that we believe deserve your full attention.

Ford Motor Company one of the largest companies on Earth has been building cars for well over a century. During that time it has produced mostly successful models that have been sold around the world. It is nearly inconceivable that any American resident alive today has not had some experience with a Ford vehicle whether they actually owned one themselves or not. They are simply so ubiquitous there is no escaping the reach of this automaker.

Some of Ford's products over the years have been less successful than others. The Edsel is a prime example of a failed project that was only on the market for a couple of years. Furthermore Ford has tried its hand in other industries -– Ford quit the airplane business after building only 199 Ford Trimotors. However regarding its core business of automobile manufacturing more products from Ford have been hit than misses which is why it has become such a large and influential business.

With manufacturing happening all over the planet Ford auto sales easily reach the millions across a wide range of models. The long history of car and truck sales based on global production has given us some of the best-selling Ford vehicles of all time. Here are 10 of them.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVlbmV3cy5uZXQvYXJ0aWNsZXMvaG91c2UtcmVwdWJsaWNhbnMtZXhwYW5kLXByb2JlLW9mLWZvcmQtZXYtZGVhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,House Republicans expand probe of Ford EV deal,"House Republicans are launching another investigation into the electric vehicle battery deal that Ford Motor Co. reached with a Chinese company earlier this year.

Energy and Commerce Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) and more than two dozen of her colleagues asked Ford CEO James Farley in a letter Tuesday to share a copy of the agreement that the automaker inked with China-based Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. or CATL to build a $3.5 billion EV plant in Marshall Mich.

The lawmakers expressed concern that “Ford’s partnership with a Chinese company could aid China’s efforts to expand its control over United States electric vehicle supply chains and jeopardize national security by furthering dependence on China.”

Melissa Miller a spokesperson for Ford said the company will respond once it receives the congressional letter to “again correct rampant misinformation” about the project. Miller said Ford alone is building the plant and will own and run the facility.

“We’re doing that instead of putting a Ford battery factory in another country — or exclusively buying these batteries made in China like our competitors do” said Miller.

Miller also pushed back on the wording of the letter and said Ford does not have a “partnership” with the Chinese company adding that CATL will not own any part of the plant.

Ford she said is licensing CATL’s battery cell technology to use in the U.S. and “will contract with them for specific services nothing more.”

The letter adds to growing calls — from mostly Republicans — for more details around Ford’s announcement in February that it planned to build an EV factory using technology from CATL the world’s largest producer of lithium iron phosphate batteries. Ford at the time expressed confidence the project would be eligible for tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.

The deal has been scrutinized by lawmakers like Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and other House Republicans launched an investigation in recent weeks.

Energy and Commerce Committee lawmakers asked Ford by Sept. 18 to share a copy of the agreement it signed with CATL as well as all communications exchanged between the two companies contractors and consultants tied to the deal. They asked whether Ford considered non-Chinese companies to partner with.

The new letter also probed how many CATL employees will work at the plant and asked what steps Ford plans to take to “prevent or limit CATL’s ability to halt production unilaterally such as at the direction of the Chinese government.”"

Doug Ghim and Kramer Hickok have logged multiple seasons on Tour. So too has Beau Hossler who locked up spots in two of the first three signature events next year by way of finishing No. 52 in FedExCup points after the fall.

Oh and Scottie Scheffler is a Masters champion Ryder Cupper and currently the world’s top-ranked player.

“You see your old teammates out there on Tour” Funk said “and it feels like you’re missing your chance.”

Well Funk is making the most of his most recent opportunity.

The 28-year-old Funk son of eight-time Tour winner Fred Funk is now four strong rounds away from joining Scheffler and Co. on the PGA Tour next season after playing his last 11 holes in 7 under to narrowly advance out of the second stage of PGA Tour Q-School on Friday in Valdosta Georgia. Funk was among the 13 players who survived the cut – and one of three who finished right on the bubble at 5 under – at a difficult Kinderlou Forest Golf Club and kept their hopes for a Tour card alive.

“We had 11 holes to go and we were kind of just trying to post a decent score to be happy with” Funk said. “And then I hit a nice shot on 17 and made birdie made a 20-footer on 18 and then birdied 1 and 2 and I’m like ‘Alright well now we have a chance.’”

Funk sandwiched a birdie at the par-3 fifth with birdie lip-outs at Nos. 4 and 6. When he stepped on the tee at the par-3 eighth his penultimate hole Funk figured he needed one more birdie maybe two. He was between clubs chose the longer one and proceeded to hook his tee ball 20 yards left and into “pretty much a dead spot.”

A day earlier Funk’s caddie reminded his boss that he hadn’t chipped in all year. That changed Friday at No. 8 as Funk holed a nearly impossible chip for another birdie. The heroics continued on the last hole the par-4 ninth as Funk yanked his worst drive of the week into some long grass but after catching a decent lie he stuffed an 8-iron to 6 feet and rolled in the putt that ultimately proved the difference for Funk whose 6-under 66 tied for the best round of the day with former Oklahoma standout Blaine Hale who tied for fifth at 8 under five shots behind medalist Aldrich Potgieter the 19-year-old South African phenom who is just months into his pro career.

“Pretty incredible finish” Funk added “and on a day that I finally gave it up to God. I’ve always tried to control it myself. … I really felt at peace today.”

Back in 2016 Funk then a redshirt sophomore at Texas famously took Oregon’s Sulman Raza to extra holes on the Ducks’ home course before falling in the deciding match of the NCAA final in Eugene. After the following season Funk turned pro with one year of eligibility remaining a decision he now regrets.

“Honestly looking back I wasn’t ready – definitely wasn’t ready” Funk said. “But I truly believe I am now.”

Funk has little experience playing on Tour or even the Korn Ferry Tour for that matter. He’s got two career starts on each tour to his name. But he’s seen plenty of the Tour’s other developmental circuits including full seasons in Canada each of the past two years. This summer’s campaign was his best to date with three top-25s and seven made cuts in 10 starts.

Last year Funk birdied two of his final three holes to keep his PGA Tour Canada card. A few months ago he closed in 60 to do the same.

“It’s a great tour and I’ve enjoyed my last two seasons on it” Funk said “but as I’ve told all the sponsors up there who have said ‘We’ll see you next year’: ‘I hope you don’t.’”

When Funk tees it up Dec. 14-17 at Sawgrass Country Club and TPC Sawgrass’ Dye’s Valley Course it will mark his first time at final stage which for the first time in over a decade has the added significance of offering PGA Tour cards (top five and ties).

For Funk there’s even more significance: A Ponte Vedra Beach Florida native grew up just minutes from TPC Sawgrass and estimates he’s played Dye’s Valley at least a thousand times and Sawgrass CC nearly 50 times.

He’s played the layouts a bunch recently too after moving back to Florida after a few years in Austin.

“I’ve seen every wind every condition every sight line I’ve hit it in every hazard” Funk said. “I still need to play well so I can’t say how much of an advantage it will be but I know for a fact that nothing will surprise me.”

Simply by advancing through second stage – James Nicholas Dawson Armstrong Michael Johnson Ryan Hall and Curtis Thompson were among the others to join Funk – Funk has at least conditional KFT status.

Of course he’d like to be able to join those aforementioned Longhorns on the big tour instead.

“You never know when that fire’s gonna hit” Funk said. “To be four rounds away it’s pretty crazy to think.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5za3lzcG9ydHMuY29tL2dvbGYvbmV3cy8xMTA3MS8xMzAyMDA5OC9kcC13b3JsZC10b3VyLW1pbi13b28tbGVlLXN1cmdlcy1pbnRvLWxlYWQtYXQtYXVzdHJhbGlhbi1vcGVuLWFzLWhlLXRhcmdldHMtYmFjay10by1iYWNrLXdpbnPSAZQBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuc2t5c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9hbXAvZ29sZi9uZXdzLzExMDcxLzEzMDIwMDk4L2RwLXdvcmxkLXRvdXItbWluLXdvby1sZWUtc3VyZ2VzLWludG8tbGVhZC1hdC1hdXN0cmFsaWFuLW9wZW4tYXMtaGUtdGFyZ2V0cy1iYWNrLXRvLWJhY2std2lucw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DP World Tour: Min Woo Lee surges into lead at Australian Open as he targets back-to-back wins,"Min Woo Lee boosted his hopes of back-to-back victories on the DP World Tour by surging into a three-shot lead during the second round of the ISPS HANDA Australian Open in Sydney.

The world No 38 won last week's Fortinet Australian PGA Championship in his homeland and now heads the field after 36 holes in New South Wales after a seven-under 64 on Friday which featured six birdies and an eagle.

Perth-born Lee began with a bogey but there were no further blemishes with two birdies on his front nine - including holing out from a bunker at the fourth - and four more coming home followed by an eagle at 18 which he secured after a sensational approach over the water from the pine straw.

The 25-year-old moved to 12 under par with Scotland's Connor Syme and America's Patrick Rodgers his nearest challengers on nine under.

Lee said: ""It's always nice to make an eagle whenever but on the last hole it's even nicer. I didn't think that we could beat last week's crowds but we've very nearly done it before the weekend so it's unreal.

""Most of my golf has been really good because of the crowd and the support.""

Syme birdied four of his first five holes en route to a two-under 70.

The Scot is looking to build on his tie for 13th at the Australian PGA Championship which Lee won by three strokes from Japan's Riyuka Hoshino.

Syme said: ""It's just a great opportunity. My last event of the year and hopefully I can go out on a high.""

Lee's countryman Sam BrazelVenezuela's Jhonattan Vegas and Chile's Joaquin Niemann sit joint fourth on eight under with Hoshino England's David Horsey and Alex Fitzpatrick and Scotland's Grant Forrest among a host of players at seven under.

Home superstars Adam Scott and Cameron Smith both made the cut and will enter the weekend at four under but Robert MacIntyre's tournament is over with the Scot's six-over par second round leaving him at four over.

Smith showed frustration at the penultimate hole when he threw his ball in the lake after a bogey.

The 2022 Open champion who failed to make the weekend at the Australian PGA Championship said: ""It's going to take my best to even get close and maybe even a little bit of help. But there's still lots of golf left.

""I feel after how I played [on Friday] that I can still make a run at least.""

Pump prices on average are 26 cents less than a month ago and 26 cents less than a year ago.

The decrease in gas prices may lose momentum following a recent uptick in oil prices. Reduced demand for gas has helped keep pump price increases in check AAA said.

""The current streak of daily pump prices either falling or staying flat started on September 19"" AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said. ""It appears this run is in jeopardy and we may see prices edge a bit higher. But if the cost of oil eventually hits reverse and dips again pump prices will likely follow suit. So stay tuned.""

The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) – an oil price benchmark – increased by $1.45 to $77.86 at the close of Wednesday’s formal trading session. Gas demand fell from 8.48 to 8.21 million barrels per day last week according to new data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Oil prices climbed due to worries that OPEC+ will uphold its production reduction agreement through next year AAA noted.

Attention Kodi Users! Kodi Addons and builds offer unlimited streaming content but could also get you into legal trouble if caught streaming free movies TV shows or sports. Currently your IP is visible to everyone. Kodi users are strongly advised to always connect to a VPN while streaming online. A good Kodi VPN hides your identity bypasses government surveillance geo-blocked content and ISP throttling (which also helps in buffer-free streaming). I personally use ExpressVPN which is the fastest and most secure VPN. It is very easy to install on any device including Amazon FireStick. You get 3 months free and save 49% on its annual plans. Also it comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you are not satisfied you can always ask for a refund. Click HERE to get 3 months free and save 49% on ExpressVPN

Fox Sports isn’t a monthly or yearly subscription-based online service unlike Netflix Hulu Sling TV and other similar services. Instead Fox Sports is available via a network subscription from your cable TV provider.

With a cable TV subscription for Fox Sports you get instant access to the service’s apps and addons. Other than that you can’t create a stand-alone account and purchase a subscription to Fox Sports.

Once you have bought a subscription to Fox Sports from your cable TV provider ask about the login details for the app. Then use the information to log in and enjoy sporting action on the go.

Is Fox Sports Kodi Addon Safe & Legal?

Before we dive in and learn how to install the Fox Sports addon on Kodi allow me to shed some light on the safety and legality of the addon. Here’s a quick intro to the SlyGuy Repository.

The SlyGuy Repository the repository hosting the Fox Sports addon is one of the most reputable repositories in the community. Also it only hosts addons for services that are legal and official.

Is Fox Sports Kodi Addon Safe?

I didn’t find anything fishy when using the Fox Sports addon. The interface is straightforward and contains nothing questionable. In addition the addon didn’t ask me to provide access to my files and folders. I also ran a virus test on the repository and found it safe. Here’s the proof:

However as I’m not a certified Kodi addon developer I can’t guarantee the addon is entirely safe. Therefore I recommend using a VPN service like ExpressVPN to keep your data safe and sound.

Is Fox Sports Kodi Addon Legal?

Fox Sports addon only works if you enter valid account details for your Fox Sports cable TV subscription. So the addon provides a legal gateway to access the Fox Sports service via the Kodi app.

However the answer remains unknown as Fox Sports isn’t available on the official repository of Kodi (unlike the old Fox Sports Go addon). We can’t label Fox Sports legal or illegal as we at FireStickTricks.com don’t have the proper resources to determine its legality.

So long story short the status of the Fox Sports addon’s safety and legality can’t be completely confirmed. I recommend using a trusted VPN service like ExpressVPN whenever you are using the addon.

Part 1: Enable Unknown Sources on Kodi

In this part we’ll first enable unknown sources on Kodi.

Although the SlyGuy Repository is a hub only for official addons and should be safe it’s still a third-party repo for Kodi. For the safety and privacy of users by default Kodi doesn’t allow the installation of any third-party repository or addon.

That’s why we’ll have to enable unknown sources on Kodi so that we can load the SlyGuy Repository on the Kodi app. Here’s how it breaks down:

1. On Kodi’s home screen select the Settings Gear icon on your screen’s top left side just below the Kodi logo.

2. Next click on the System tile on your screen’s bottom right side.

7. Enter slyguy in the input box and click on the OK button.

11. Scroll down and select Install from zip file.

12. On Kodi 19 you’ll receive a warning from Kodi. Go through it and click on the Yes button to continue.

13. Next the Install from zip file window will appear. Scroll down and select slyguy.

14. After that click on the repository.slyguy.zip file to download and install the SlyGuy Repository.

15. Wait for a few seconds and you’ll receive a notification on the top right side of your screen stating SlyGuy Repository Add-on installed. Stay on this screen.

8. Once done you’ll receive a notification in the top right corner of your screen stating FOX Sports Add-on installed.

Congratulations! You have installed the Fox Sports addon on your Kodi app.

Step 1: Get the ExpressVPN subscription HERE. It comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. Meaning you can use it free for the first 30-days and if you are not satisfied with the performance (which is highly unlikely) you can ask for a full refund.

Step 2: Click HERE to download and install the ExpressVPN app on your streaming device. If you are using a FireStick I have given the exact steps starting with Step 4 below.

Step 3: Click the Power icon to connect to a VPN server. That's all. Your connection is now secure with the fastest and best VPN for Kodi.

The following are the steps to install Kodi VPN on your Fire TV devices. If you have other streaming devices follow Step 1-3 above.

Step 4: Subscribe to ExpressVPN HERE (if not subscribed already).

Step 5: Go to Fire TV Stick home screen. Click Find followed by Search option (see image below).

Step 6: Type Expressvpn in the search bar and select when it shows up.

Step 7: Click Download.

FAQ’s

Is Fox Sports an official addon?

It’s complicated. The addon for Fox Sports itself is linked to the legal service Fox Sports offers and requires a subscription. However as it isn’t available on the official repository of Kodi we can’t label it as official.

Although the Fox Sports addon runs like a champ after entering your subscription details it isn’t the official creation of Kodi or Fox Sports.

Why isn’t Fox Sports Go addon working?

Fox Sports Go by the Fox Corporation is now known as Fox Sports. Unfortunately since the change the official addon for Fox Sports Go hasn’t been updated to Fox Sports by the Kodi team. So although it’s available on the list and installable you can’t run it as it gives an error.

So the Fox Sports Go addon is outdated and doesn’t work anymore. The one that works is available from the SlyGuy Repository as Fox Sports.

What are the requirements to use Fox Sports on Kodi?

Fox Sports addon on SlyGuy Repository is based on the official service provided by Fox Corporation. You’ll need valid subscription details from your cable TV provider to use it.

Without logging in the Fox Sports addon isn’t useable. Although you can download and install it you won’t get past the home screen without entering your details for a valid cable account that includes Fox Sports.

Should I use a VPN with Fox Sports addon?

As Fox Sports isn’t an official addon of Kodi I recommend using a trusted VPN service like ExpressVPN.

With a VPN your data and activity remain super safe. Everything important stays encrypted like your IP address and activity log.

Although users haven’t reported anything suspicious about the addon it’s better to stay one step ahead.

Pump prices on average are 26 cents less than a month ago and 26 cents less than a year ago.

The decrease in gas prices may lose momentum following a recent uptick in oil prices. Reduced demand for gas has helped keep pump price increases in check AAA said.

""The current streak of daily pump prices either falling or staying flat started on September 19"" AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said. ""It appears this run is in jeopardy and we may see prices edge a bit higher. But if the cost of oil eventually hits reverse and dips again pump prices will likely follow suit. So stay tuned.""

The West Texas Intermediate (WTI) – an oil price benchmark – increased by $1.45 to $77.86 at the close of Wednesday’s formal trading session. Gas demand fell from 8.48 to 8.21 million barrels per day last week according to new data from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

Oil prices climbed due to worries that OPEC+ will uphold its production reduction agreement through next year AAA noted.

Attention Kodi Users! Kodi Addons and builds offer unlimited streaming content but could also get you into legal trouble if caught streaming free movies TV shows or sports. Currently your IP is visible to everyone. Kodi users are strongly advised to always connect to a VPN while streaming online. A good Kodi VPN hides your identity bypasses government surveillance geo-blocked content and ISP throttling (which also helps in buffer-free streaming). I personally use ExpressVPN which is the fastest and most secure VPN. It is very easy to install on any device including Amazon FireStick. You get 3 months free and save 49% on its annual plans. Also it comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you are not satisfied you can always ask for a refund. Click HERE to get 3 months free and save 49% on ExpressVPN

Fox Sports isn’t a monthly or yearly subscription-based online service unlike Netflix Hulu Sling TV and other similar services. Instead Fox Sports is available via a network subscription from your cable TV provider.

With a cable TV subscription for Fox Sports you get instant access to the service’s apps and addons. Other than that you can’t create a stand-alone account and purchase a subscription to Fox Sports.

Once you have bought a subscription to Fox Sports from your cable TV provider ask about the login details for the app. Then use the information to log in and enjoy sporting action on the go.

Is Fox Sports Kodi Addon Safe & Legal?

Before we dive in and learn how to install the Fox Sports addon on Kodi allow me to shed some light on the safety and legality of the addon. Here’s a quick intro to the SlyGuy Repository.

The SlyGuy Repository the repository hosting the Fox Sports addon is one of the most reputable repositories in the community. Also it only hosts addons for services that are legal and official.

Is Fox Sports Kodi Addon Safe?

I didn’t find anything fishy when using the Fox Sports addon. The interface is straightforward and contains nothing questionable. In addition the addon didn’t ask me to provide access to my files and folders. I also ran a virus test on the repository and found it safe. Here’s the proof:

However as I’m not a certified Kodi addon developer I can’t guarantee the addon is entirely safe. Therefore I recommend using a VPN service like ExpressVPN to keep your data safe and sound.

Is Fox Sports Kodi Addon Legal?

Fox Sports addon only works if you enter valid account details for your Fox Sports cable TV subscription. So the addon provides a legal gateway to access the Fox Sports service via the Kodi app.

However the answer remains unknown as Fox Sports isn’t available on the official repository of Kodi (unlike the old Fox Sports Go addon). We can’t label Fox Sports legal or illegal as we at FireStickTricks.com don’t have the proper resources to determine its legality.

So long story short the status of the Fox Sports addon’s safety and legality can’t be completely confirmed. I recommend using a trusted VPN service like ExpressVPN whenever you are using the addon.

How to Install Fox Sports on Kodi

Finally it’s time to install the Fox Sports addon on Kodi. I have divided the section into three parts so you can easily follow along and install Fox Sports on your Kodi app. Follow the parts and their respective steps to avoid any issues. So without further ado let’s get started.

Part 1: Enable Unknown Sources on Kodi

In this part we’ll first enable unknown sources on Kodi.

Although the SlyGuy Repository is a hub only for official addons and should be safe it’s still a third-party repo for Kodi. For the safety and privacy of users by default Kodi doesn’t allow the installation of any third-party repository or addon.

That’s why we’ll have to enable unknown sources on Kodi so that we can load the SlyGuy Repository on the Kodi app. Here’s how it breaks down:

1. On Kodi’s home screen select the Settings Gear icon on your screen’s top left side just below the Kodi logo.

2. Next click on the System tile on your screen’s bottom right side.

3. On the System page scroll down to the Add-ons tab in the left-hand menu.

5. A warning message will appear on your screen. Read it and click on the Yes button to continue.

Part 2: Install the Repository with Fox Sports

In this part we’ll load the SlyGuy Repository on Kodi so we can install the Fox Sports addon.

The SlyGuy Repository is one of the most popular third-party repositories in the game with an excellent reputation. However this repository only features the addons of official services like Fox Sports Netflix Adult Swim and more.

Although the developers of the SlyGuy Repository aren’t associated with official Kodi addons they provide addons for legal and trusted services. So here’s how you can load the SlyGuy Repository on your Kodi app:

1. On the home screen of Kodi click on the Settings Gear icon located on the top left side of your screen just below the Kodi logo.

2. On the next screen click on the File manager tile at the top left.

3. Next select Add source.

Note that if you have added repositories in the past you’ll find the Add source option at the end of the list.

4. A window will appear. Click on the <None> label.

5. An input window with a keyboard will appear on your screen. Enter https://k.slyguy.xyz and click on the OK button.

Note: We at FireStickTricks.com don’t host or own the Sly Guy Repository nor are we affiliated with it. I have just provided the official link to the repository so you can add it to your Kodi app.

6. Next you’ll have to pick the name of the source. To do that click on the input box under Enter a name for this media source.

7. Enter slyguy in the input box and click on the OK button.

8. Double-check everything and click the OK button to save the source.

9. You’ll see that Kodi has successfully added the SlyGuy Repository source to your file manager list.

10. Go one step back using your device’s back button and you’ll land on the settings page. Next click on the Add-ons tile located alongside File Manager.

11. Scroll down and select Install from zip file.

12. On Kodi 19 you’ll receive a warning from Kodi. Go through it and click on the Yes button to continue.

13. Next the Install from zip file window will appear. Scroll down and select slyguy.

14. After that click on the repository.slyguy.zip file to download and install the SlyGuy Repository.

15. Wait for a few seconds and you’ll receive a notification on the top right side of your screen stating SlyGuy Repository Add-on installed. Stay on this screen.

Part 3: Install Fox Sports

Enabled unknown sources check. Loaded the SlyGuy Repository check. So as we now have everything in place it’s time to install the Fox Sports Kodi addon.

1. On the same screen scroll up and select Install from repository.

2. Next scroll down and select SlyGuy Repository.

3. You’ll see a list of categories in the SlyGuy Repository. Scroll down and select Video add-ons.

4. Now you’ll see tons of video addons in an alphabetical list. Scroll down to the F section and select FOX Sports.

5. The Fox Sports dashboard will appear. Click on the Install button on your screen’s bottom right side.

6. The Fox Sports addon will need to install other addons as some of its services depend on it. So click on the OK button to confirm the process.

7. Wait for the download and installation to complete.

8. Once done you’ll receive a notification in the top right corner of your screen stating FOX Sports Add-on installed.

Congratulations! You have installed the Fox Sports addon on your Kodi app.

Before you start streaming with Kodi Addons or Builds I would like to warn you that everything you stream on Kodi is visible to your ISP and Government. This means streaming copyrighted content (free movies TV shows live TV and Sports) might get you into legal trouble.

Thankfully there is a foolproof way to keep all your streaming activities hidden from your ISP and the Government. All you need is a good VPN for Kodi. A VPN will mask your original IP which is and will help you bypass Online Surveillance ISP throttling and content geo-restrictions.

I personally use and recommend ExpressVPN which is the fastest and most secure VPN. It is compatible with all kinds of streaming apps and devices.

NOTE: We do not encourage the violation of copyright laws. But what if you end up streaming content from an illegitimate source unintentionally? It is not always easy to tell the difference between a legit and illegal source.

So before you start streaming on Kodi here's how to get VPN protection in 3 simple steps.

Step 1: Get the ExpressVPN subscription HERE. It comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee. Meaning you can use it free for the first 30-days and if you are not satisfied with the performance (which is highly unlikely) you can ask for a full refund.

Step 2: Click HERE to download and install the ExpressVPN app on your streaming device. If you are using a FireStick I have given the exact steps starting with Step 4 below.

Step 3: Click the Power icon to connect to a VPN server. That's all. Your connection is now secure with the fastest and best VPN for Kodi.

The following are the steps to install Kodi VPN on your Fire TV devices. If you have other streaming devices follow Step 1-3 above.

Step 4: Subscribe to ExpressVPN HERE (if not subscribed already).

Step 5: Go to Fire TV Stick home screen. Click Find followed by Search option (see image below).

Step 6: Type Expressvpn in the search bar and select when it shows up.

Step 7: Click Download.

Step 8: Open the ExpressVPN app and Sign in using the email ID and password that you created while buying the ExpressVPN subscription.

Step 9: Click the Power icon to connect to a VPN server. That’s all. Your FireStick is now secured with the fastest VPN.

FAQ’s

Is Fox Sports an official addon?

It’s complicated. The addon for Fox Sports itself is linked to the legal service Fox Sports offers and requires a subscription. However as it isn’t available on the official repository of Kodi we can’t label it as official.

Although the Fox Sports addon runs like a champ after entering your subscription details it isn’t the official creation of Kodi or Fox Sports.

Why isn’t Fox Sports Go addon working?

Fox Sports Go by the Fox Corporation is now known as Fox Sports. Unfortunately since the change the official addon for Fox Sports Go hasn’t been updated to Fox Sports by the Kodi team. So although it’s available on the list and installable you can’t run it as it gives an error.

So the Fox Sports Go addon is outdated and doesn’t work anymore. The one that works is available from the SlyGuy Repository as Fox Sports.

What are the requirements to use Fox Sports on Kodi?

Fox Sports addon on SlyGuy Repository is based on the official service provided by Fox Corporation. You’ll need valid subscription details from your cable TV provider to use it.

Without logging in the Fox Sports addon isn’t useable. Although you can download and install it you won’t get past the home screen without entering your details for a valid cable account that includes Fox Sports.

Should I use a VPN with Fox Sports addon?

As Fox Sports isn’t an official addon of Kodi I recommend using a trusted VPN service like ExpressVPN.

With a VPN your data and activity remain super safe. Everything important stays encrypted like your IP address and activity log.

Although users haven’t reported anything suspicious about the addon it’s better to stay one step ahead.

BEN,Franklin Templeton,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vY3J5cHRvLzIwMjMvMTIvMDIvZnJhbmtsaW4tdGVtcGxldG9uLWplbm55LWpvaG5zb24tYml0Y29pbi1ldGZzLWNyeXB0by1pbnZlc3RpbmctYmxvY2tjaGFpbi10ZWNobm9sb2d5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Franklin Templeton's Jenny Johnson on Bitcoin ETFs investing in crypto and how her firm is harnessing the blockchain,"At the Fortune Global Forum Nov. 27–29 in Abu Dhabi I had a chance to talk with Jenny Johnson the president and CEO of Franklin Templeton which has grown from a small brokerage founded in 1947 to a global giant that now manages over $1.3 trillion.

Among the top financial firms Franklin Templeton has been at the forefront of exploring blockchain technology. In 2021 it launched the first U.S.-registered mutual fund to use a public blockchain to process and record transactions as well as crypto-focused separately managed accounts or SMAs. And in September the firm filed an application for a Bitcoin ETF.

In our conversation Johnson discusses a variety of topics including the role blockchain will play in her firm’s long-term success and how it will help democratize markets.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Franklin Templeton has been actively exploring blockchain technology recently filing an application for its Franklin Bitcoin ETF. Could you elaborate a bit on how blockchain fits into your long-term strategy?

I think it’s important that we differentiate Bitcoin and blockchain. I think that there’s a demand for Bitcoin. It has its own use case and that’s why you’re seeing these ETFs. What gets me more excited as I think about the future you look at blockchain technology and it’s going to enable access to things like private markets. It’s going to enable the democratization of private markets. Well why does it do that? This is because the technology takes out the frictional costs associated with processing transactions. And if you can reduce the friction in transactions then you can more easily securitize or fractionalize ownership of things that would have been operationally too difficult to consider. Instead you’re able to create and transfer ownership of these hard-to-process assets much easier.

It’s going to unlock nontraditional non-correlated types of asset classes that are going to be interesting for our clients. We also think that it’s going to make more efficient the types of products that you have today. ETFs trade all day but only price twice a day. So imagine that you build a pooled vehicle on the blockchain. When you transact you can have the smart contract tell you exactly what the underlying value of those securities is. It’s just a much more efficient way to be able to operate.

And when you have atomic settlement or you have immediate settlement it removes the potential for fraud it takes out latency in the system. It’s going to be all about efficiency. At Franklin Templeton we developed a tokenized money-market fund. We built a shareholder recordkeeping system on that. We are a node validator we actually advise on different portfolios. We have passive portfolios and active portfolios. While these are all in their early stages they demonstrate that we’re big believers in this space.

When do you think the first Bitcoin spot ETF will be approved?

I don’t know. That’s in the hands of the regulators as they’re trying to figure out the best approach. Their job is to protect the consumers and I think they’ll do it in time as appropriate.

Have you seen significant interest from clients for a Bitcoin spot ETF? Do you expect an influx of funds after it is approved?

I think there’s obviously a demand for Bitcoin and I believe a spot ETF is a better way to access Bitcoin. As long as they trade the bid-ask is narrow it should be a better way to do it. It’s a much more convenient way for anybody interested in investing in Bitcoin.

But I think Bitcoin has some challenges. It’s hard to anchor to any kind of investment thesis. It tends to be a risk-on/risk-off type of asset. You just want to make sure clients are responsible in how they allocate Bitcoin.

How did you first discover blockchain and crypto?

I ran the technology division years ago at Franklin Templeton. So I’m always staying focused on new technological trends. This was one that I thought initially would take longer to mature but I’ve been impressed to see the various platforms and how quickly they’ve matured and the innovation that’s happened in various companies that are being created on these layer-1s. But it was just because I spent about a third of my time on disruptive technologies and it was one just like AI that I paid attention to.

Do you personally invest in cryptocurrency?

I do have some investments. It’s small for my overall portfolio but I definitely have investments there.

Can you share some of your picks?

Well I haven’t had more picks. They’re all standard: Ethereum a little Bitcoin SushiSwap Uniswap. I have a couple of different things like that.

Looking ahead do you plan to launch other blockchain- or crypto-related products? Some other wealth managers have for example crypto indexes or retirement plans or futures ETFs.

ETFs don’t tend to be big in the retirement channel but they may. Retirement plans have fiduciaries that make the decision about what investments are on there. So that would be the choice of the fiduciary. Our job is to make the products available.

You’ve had big success with your U.S. money-market fund which is tokenized and has inflows of over $ 270 million. Do you plan to tokenize any other funds?

As I mentioned earlier I think that technology is a really great opportunity. And as it matures there’ll be more investment opportunities. I always say at Franklin Templeton our expertise is in making active risk-adjusted investment decisions and we deliver them in whatever vehicle our clients would like us to deliver them. Blockchain creates one type of vehicle with tokenization and so yes we do see it as a channel to ultimately be able to deliver our expertise.

Franklin Templeton ventured into the world of NFTs by issuing some to attendees of your first Innovation Forum last year. What use cases do you see for NFTs and how do you feel about them personally?

Look I think as in anything there’s mature investments that make a lot of sense. And then there’s a lot that don’t make any sense. I tend to make investments in things that I think are anchored in having financial returns because I think that you have better chances of success there. There are some things that are like art in an NFT where if two people love it they will find a market price for it. And so there’s going to be opportunities in that space. Not all will be successful not all will be good but there will be some that are successful.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5iYS5jb20vY2VsdGljcy92aWRlb3MvdW5maWx0ZXJlZC1wcmVzZW50ZWQtYnktcHV0bmFtLTEyLTEtdnMtcGhp0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Unfiltered presented by Putnam | 12/1 vs. PHI,"Copyright © 2024 NBA Media Ventures LLC.

That's the state of affairs in the fintech industry.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has recently directed banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) to increase the risk weights for consumer credit and bank credit by an extra 25 percentage points. This means that banks and NBFCs will need more capital and as a result the interest rates for loans to consumers might go up.

This will have a direct impact on NBFCs and more particularly on fintech firms.

Fintech companies facing a potential funding crunch due to the anticipated decline in bank support may be forced to seek capital through the public markets or consolidation particularly those with a higher concentration of unsecured loans.

The fintech companies will now be forced to come to the market to raise money as bank funding drys up. ""I will not be surprised if in the next 2-3 months there are multiple fintech companies out in the market to raise money. It has to happen” said Jairam Sridharan MD Piramal Capital & Housing Finance Ltd.

Sridharam made this comment at India's debt capital market summit in Mumbai on Friday.

Many fintech NBFCs provide completely unsecured loans. They will require a larger amount of capital. “There will be a spate of fintech NBFCs either selling out or trying to raise capital as a direct consequence of the higher risk weights” added Sridharan of Piramal Capital.

“We should look at diversifying the liabilities. That’s what the RBI has been saying to NBFCs especially reducing their dependence on the banking system” said Rakesh Singh MD &CEO of Aditya Birla Finance Ltd.

“We are all happy to explore NCDs or public NCDs. This provides an alternative source of finances. This will also help in building a sustainable liability over a period of time” added Singh.

The outstanding credit of banks to NBFCs increased by a staggering 31 per cent year on year reaching Rs 12.9 lakh crore in January of this year. A CareEdge report noted ""The growth has remained robust due to the high expansion in the NBFC asset book and additional borrowings shifting to banks because of differentials between market yields interest rates offered by banks and reduced borrowings in the overseas market.""

“This is an opportunity for mutual funds to invest in the NBFCs” said Rajeev Radhakrishnan chief investment officer (fixed income) at SBI Mutual Fund.

However the mutual funds' debt exposure to NBFCs plunged by 11.6 per cent YoY to Rs.1.49 lakh crore. The share of MFs has consistently declined for the last several quarters. The CareEdge report attributed this to a combination of higher interest rates in the bond markets led by elevated long-term G-Sec rates and risk aversion in the debt capital markets restricting funding availability for NBFCs rated lower than the highest categories.

Currently debt mutual funds are not allowed to invest more than 10 per cent of their AUM in any scheme in triple-A-rated corporates. In fact the exposure limits go down for lower-rated corporates.

In the pre-2020 period mutual funds were increasingly investing in lower-rated corporates or disproportionately higher shares in the corporate sector. In 2022 Sebi corrected this anomaly due to frequent defaults and the Franklin Templeton fiasco.

The appeal challenges the National Company Law Tribunal Mumbai order rejecting IDBI trusteeship's objection to the merger.



The grounds being that Chandra had executed a personal guarantee on June 25 2019 in favour of IDBI Trusteeship (for the benefit of Franklin Templeton) guaranteeing the repayment obligations towards the debentures.



""Chandra has purportedly failed to comply with his obligations under the personal guarantee"" they said.



The trusteeship claimed Rs 535 crore from Chandra saying he failed to comply with his obligations under the personal guarantee and thus he is a creditor.



""IDBI Trusteeship is admittedly not a creditor of Zee. It has no contractual or legal privity with Zee. Therefore it has no locus to object to the present scheme"" Zee responded.



The hearing was deferred as the case was transferred to the bench of Chairperson Ashok Bhushan of NCLAT.



IDBI Trusteeship told the NCLT that it is the debenture trustee of 425 debentures issued by Essel Infraprojects Limited (EIL) in favour of certain schemes managed by Franklin Templeton Asset Management (India) Pvt. Ltd.

“The settlement reflects well what the market will look like in 2024 which is always the top principle of our negotiations” Targhetta said.

The deals reached on Friday effectively made $80/8 cents the benchmark for 2024 that is expected to be followed by other smelters and miners in the industry.

Concentrate treatment and refining charges form a key component of copper smelters’ income for converting copper concentrate into metal which typically fall and squeeze smelters’ profit margins when concentrate supply is tight.

Smelters have been under increasing pressure amid supply uncertainty from a mine in Panama after the country’s president directed the mine to be shut down.

“We accepted the offer as prices might get worse if the negotiation gets delayed” a source at a Chinese smelter said.

Jiangxi Copper Co Tongling Nonferrous Metals Group and China Copper the three biggest Chinese copper smelters were not immediately available for comment.

Antofagasta said it does not comment on copper negotiations.

Talks between smelters and miners this year dragged on longer due to split views on whether there will be a shortage or a surplus market of copper concentrate in 2024.

Last month smelters were looking for higher fees from miner Freeport-McMoRan Inc above those agreed between Antofagasta and Jinchuan which fell short of what the smelters expected.

The Garmin Forerunner 965 955 265 and 255 have received software update 17.24 as of November 30.

The update adds features introduced by the Venu 3 like Nap tracking enhanced Body Battery improved UI tricks and new activities.

The public beta of this update launched on October 31.

Garmin's top-end Forerunner models of the last two years have received a key software update this week bringing improvements introduced by the Venu 3 when it launched in August.

Garmin software update 17.24 launched as a public beta in late October and most of the updates are unchanged. My Garmin Forerunner 965 auto-updated yesterday with the public version and already shows the live changes so I've been able to check a few of them out.

The highest-profile addition from the Venu 3 is a new Naps widget that detects sleep during the day and incorporates that recharge into your Body Battery score. Although you have Sleep Score you don't get Sleep Coaching something Garmin might be reserving for its Venu series.

Body Battery also gets a revamp: instead of merely showing your score you'll see specific points of your day and how they impacted your energy including stress levels activities naps and so on.

One improvement not found in the initial beta is Course point improvements. Right now you can follow along with a custom course created in the Connect app or with a previous run activity — but they weren't easy to follow. Now Garmin says courses will have a ""large number of course points"" and better ""turn notifications"" than before.

Also on the Forerunner 955 and 965 specifically you'll get ""Up Ahead Voice Prompts"" that play over Bluetooth to your phone's connected earbuds.

Another cool trick is the ability to add more than one location to the Weather widget. Inputting a city name on the watch is slow and finicky but it lets you type and search on your phone via the Connect app (which I recommend). I managed to add one new location but trying to add a second seems to be making the watch glitch as it says the watch is ""busy"" and then infinitely searches.

Back to changes introduced by the Venu 3: Update 17.24 adds a large font mode to make the text more readable — especially useful for the MIP Forerunner models — and gives you the ability to see images in your phone notification pop-ups. Unfortunately the latter update will only work if you have an Android phone.

Next like the Venu 3 the AMOLED Forerunner models — the 265 and 965 — add a Red Shift mode which ""changes the display color to red green or orange to preserve night vision in low light."" It's useful for nighttime activities or for checking your watch in bed without blinding yourself.

(Image credit: Michael Hicks / Android Central)

Rounding out the list you'll find ""new activities for team sports racket sports and more"" though the update log doesn't specify what those new activities are. The current full list of team and racket sports are the following: Basketball Volleyball Field Hockey Ice Hockey Football/Soccer American Football Lacrosse Rugby Ultimate Disc Cricket Softball Baseball Tennis Pickleball and Padel.

But truth be told because we’ve only been using them for walking and mountaineering with the occasional bit of running and skiing we’ve probably been using less than 20% of the Fenix’s capacity. And when you bear in mind the new Fenix 7 starts from £600 (up to a staggering £1050) that hardly seems good value.

This is where the new Instinct 2 comes in. Starting at half the price of the Fenix 7 and with 26% off this Black Friday 2023 it offers all the features we need from a watch with only a few extraneous bells and whistles. In fact we’ve yet to find something we’ve used on the Fenix that isn’t also available on the Instinct 2.

Like the Fenix the Instinct 2 is available as a Solar version which supplements the already impressive battery life with power from the sun. For those who like the functionality of a GPS smartwatch but aren’t so keen on their bulk there’s also the lighter Instinct 2S and 2S Solar watches which feature a slimmer fitting and a smaller bezel at the expense of some battery life.

It has all the features we’ve come to expect in a smartwatch: Bluetooth connection to a phone for on-wrist messaging calendar reminders music and electronic payments. Plus of course a wealth of sports tracking and GPS functions. The watch comes in numerous eye-catching colours and special Surf Tactical and Camo editions. And with Garmin’s ‘Your Watch Your Way’ program you can build customised versions; through a variety of bezel and band choices there are more than 240 design combinations.

We’re still probably not using 100% of what the Instinct 2 can offer but what it does do it does brilliantly.

Six things you need to know about the Garmin Instinct 2

But often looking back can paint a picture of where we have been to give us the foresight we need to know where we should be heading.

Looking at the next big tech trend and who’s leading the technology charge to make it happen for the companies and the worker of tomorrow we must understand the biggest tech trends of now.

We must identify the lessons we have learned in the past 12 months and we must use this information to then lead the charge with generative AI (artificial intelligence) digital twin Industry 4.0 quantum AR (augmented reality) and VR (virtual reality) metaverse machine learning and so much more?

Consider just one big example: generative AI. We know adoption has soared in this area in the past 12 months. Gartner polled more than 1400 executive leaders and found 45% reported they are in piloting mode with generative AI and another 10% have put generative AI solutions into production.

These numbers are impressive especially when you compare them to a poll from March and April 2023 which shows only 15% of respondents were piloting generative and only 4% were in production. The growth here in such a short period of time is huge—and of course this is only one example.

How will you help demystify the technology solutions that will drive innovation into the next decade? To have a better idea of how to answer this question we polled a few experts. Let’s start by looking where we have been to know where we are going.

What were the biggest tech trends you noticed in 2023?

“Parks Associates notes 5 tech trends for 2023

This trend underscores the growing need for standardized protocols and interfaces to enable more efficient cross-industry integration. Artificial Intelligence Integration: Artificial intelligence is increasingly being integrated across various sectors leading to transformative changes in how businesses operate and deliver services. This integration is not just enhancing efficiencies but also enabling new capabilities and business models fundamentally reshaping industries. Emphasis on Energy Efficiency: There’s a growing focus on energy efficiency and the implementation of sophisticated energy management systems. This trend reflects a heightened awareness of sustainability issues and the need for smarter energy consumption in response to global environmental challenges. Advancements in Networking: Significant advancements are being made in networking technology enhancing the capability of devices to connect exchange data and integrate across different home ecosystems. This progress is pivotal in creating more cohesive and responsive smart home environments where various devices work together seamlessly. Emergence of Smart Spaces: The concept of smart spaces is gaining traction particularly in multifamily hospitality and small-to-medium business sectors where connectivity is increasingly central to operations. These environments are rapidly evolving into more intelligent and interconnected spaces offering enhanced experiences and operational efficiencies through advanced technology integration.” – Elizabeth Parks president and CMO Parks Associates

Caleb Thomson

“Generative AI (‘GenAI’) I think has made the largest impression in the minds of supply chain leaders. We are beginning to see meaningful progress in accessible use cases such as ‘natural language processing’ for user-guide/help-manual/application navigation questions (essentially loading the software vendor’s existing documentation in a generative AI solution). Further extension of these capabilities will likely require development of more narrowly banded and trained AI that is more specific to each software vendor (at least in the near-term). These techniques (GenAI and NLP) may then be able to manage further activities such as parameter setting scenario impact/trade-off analysis and report generation/manipulation also driven from a natural language processing capability (e.g. ‘chat bot’ or ‘voice to text’ enabled solutions).” – Caleb Thomson senior director analyst Gartner Supply Chain practice

Rod Fontecilla

“Definitely generative AI with ChatGPT coming along in November 2022 it took everyone by surprise and democratized AI for the masses. Companies had to switch quickly their AI strategies from thinking that they had a few years to implement it to react quickly and start investing into how to integrate Gen AI into their business models and supporting their clients.” – Rod Fontecilla chief innovation officer Guidehouse

What were the biggest lessons learned?

“Adopting new technologies is a complex and time-intensive process. The IoT (Internet of Things ) markets encompassing consumer multifamily and SMB (small-to-medium business) sectors exhibit remarkable fragmentation and competitiveness. This landscape is continually evolving with the emergence of new entrants and the strategic realignment of established players aiming to maintain and expand their market share.” – Elizabeth Parks president and CMO Parks Associates

“When I speak to leaders at the most mature organizations or perhaps the organizations with the largest innovation budgets I often hear of very meaningful efforts and progress towards enterprise supply chain data rationalization. This looks like migrating what at times can be dozens of discrete siloed ERP systems that require separate support and maintenance to much more singular and global cloud ERP solutions. These efforts along with others toward developing more singular logical representations of supply chain data in something like an enterprise supply chain data-lake can set the foundation for further end-to-end supply chain visibility and analytics (as decision support) drive performance improvements.” – Caleb Thomson senior director analyst Gartner Supply Chain practice

“I think what was most impacting was the speed of adoption. Companies were not ready to let all their employees use these tools. However these new tools are so powerful that if you are not using them you are falling behind rapidly. So the lesson learned is to embrace technology and come up with ways to manage the potential risk.” – Rod Fontecilla chief innovation officer Guidehouse

How can we take the lessons learned from 2023 and apply them in 2024?

“In order to capitalize on the potential of AI and perhaps particularly GenAI in the near term organizations need to be clearer about how they organize and provide continual validation for their supply chain data. There are very interesting and emerging opportunities to point ML (machine learning) solutions at the foundational problems of data availability and quality and I think leaders who foster technology enablement for data governance within their supply chain will be best situated to realize further productivity gains through more exact and precise decision making (improving decision quality).” – Caleb Thomson senior director analyst Gartner Supply Chain practice

“If I read the tea leaves I would say we are very close to AGI or at least some form of Gen AI that can reasoned on its own and solve complex problems without human help. We need to get ready embrace these technologies learn to manage the risk and re-skill the workforce rapidly.” – Rod Fontecilla Chief Innovation Officer Guidehouse

What was the biggest technology of the year?

“Generative AI is being infused within all industries and certainly is the most impactful technology in 2023.” – Elizabeth Parks president and CMO Parks Associates

“GenAI and Datalakes (e.g. Snowflake Data-bricks) / Cloud Data Platforms (MS Azzure AWS Google Cloud Platform)” – Caleb Thomson senior director analyst Gartner Supply Chain practice

“I would say Gen AI hands down.” – Rod Fontecilla Chief Innovation Officer Guidehouse

Do you believe companies are more readily embracing gen AI in December 2023 than they were in January of 2023?

“Yes.” – Elizabeth Parks President and CMO Parks Associates

“We see GenAI as still in the ‘Innovation Trigger’ phase of our Hype Cycle for Supply Chain Strategy and would see it become a technique that offers mainstream productivity gains across most organizations in 5-10 years; so to that extent yes they are more readily considering GenAI but it may be some time until most are able to productively use GenAI.” – Caleb Thomson senior director analyst Gartner Supply Chain practice

“Absolutely they have realized that if they don’t embrace them and re-skill their workforce the competition will do it and they will be left behind.” – Rod Fontecilla chief innovation officer Guidehouse

What comes next?

“The Internet of Things is ushering in an unprecedented era of service delivery across various environments including consumer multifamily and small-to-medium business sectors. This evolution is increasingly influencing the commercial and small business realms driven by consumer market demands for innovative technology. The consumer tech market having cultivated a new level of familiarity and expectation around applications and services is setting the stage for a seamless transition of these advancements into the enterprise and SMB markets.” – Elizabeth Parks president and CMO Parks Associates

“With ‘composability’ as a concept increasingly being applied to commercial supply chain solutions I think that there is great potential for a ‘data-divide’ where the organizations that have laid the proper groundwork for more nimble and agile data use within their supply chain functions (particularly planning) will be better positioned to realize greater decision accuracy and higher levels of productivity from their internal resources. I think the constraint that may separate the winners from the losers may be availability of highly skilled resources that sit at the nexus of supply chain functional knowledge and data-science to drive adoption and industry use of ‘composable’ applications within supply chain.” – Caleb Thomson senior director analyst Gartner Supply Chain practice

“I think based on the OpenAI drama the AGI is around the corner in some fashion. How governments and companies will use it will be interesting to see. The amount of disinformation next year (election year) will be enormous and will impact everyone including how we vote and who do we elect. How can we trust any piece of information that comes out? Any video any picture? They all may be fake.” – Rod Fontecilla chief innovation officer Guidehouse",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhcnRuZXIuY29tL2VuL3N1cHBseS1jaGFpbi9pbnNpZ2h0cy9iZXlvbmQtc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLWJsb2cvdGFyZ2V0aW5nLWNsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLWFjdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Targeting Climate Change Action,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.gartner.com/en/supply-chain/insights/beyond-supply-chain-blog/targeting-climate-change-action on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdhcnRuZXIuY29tL2VuL3N1cHBseS1jaGFpbi9pbnNpZ2h0cy9iZXlvbmQtc3VwcGx5LWNoYWluLWJsb2cvdGFyZ2V0aW5nLWNsaW1hdGUtY2hhbmdlLWFjdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vY2lvbmV3cy5jby5pbi9wcm9ncmVzcy1yZWNvZ25pemVkLWZvci1kaWdpdGFsLWV4cGVyaWVuY2UtcGxhdGZvcm1zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Progress Recognized as a 2023 Gartner® Peer Insights™ Customers’ Choice for Digital Experience Platforms,"Large and midsize enterprise customers from around the world recommend the Progress Digital Experience (DX) Solution.

You would be forgiven for being led to believe that generative AI will change the world and it will do so right now. As it turns out the world of Indian corporate IT spending will not be significantly changed by the groundbreaking technology at least until 2025 according to Gartner.

But despite that the Indian IT spending forecast looks quite rosy. Overall IT spending had shrunk by 0.5 per cent between 2022 and 2023 attributed to inflation pressure. The increasing adoption of digital technologies in the country will call for greater implementation of cloud services and IT services. This should mean that corporate spending on IT infrastructure is set to increase by 10.7 per cent in 2024 according to consultancy firm Gartner."

This summer international teams joined forces to attack major wildfires by air and land in Greece Canada and Hawaii among other far-flung locales. In California where more than 25% of the population lives in areas at very high or extremely high risk of wildfire a slower season was a welcome reprieve at a time when the state sees an average of more than 1.57 million acres destroyed by fire each year.But firefighting teams in Los Angeles San Diego and Ventura County along with state wildfire crews at Cal Fire are feeling better prepared to tackle future conflagrations medical evacuations and search-and-rescue operations these days because of one particular advantage: the Firehawk a modified Sikorsky Black Hawk helicopter powered by GE Aerospace’s T700 engines.Equipped with an array of advanced technologies and capabilities the helicopters are specially customized to fight fires and serve as ambulances in the air. The Firehawk starts as a Sikorsky S-70i helicopter a third generation Black Hawk variant. The aircraft is then modified with an external belly tank extended landing gear hoist and other aerial firefighting equipment. In the field they are capable of transporting “Helitack Crews” — up to 11 firefighters and their gear — into burn areas and dispensing water and retardant chemicals from a 1000-gallon tank.Due in large part to its enhanced T700-701D engines the helicopter provides increased engine power and reliability for higher altitude operations. The engines also power a pump that can fill an exterior tank in less than 60 seconds through a retractable snorkel hose while hovering over a water source.“It’s a very powerful engine that requires very little maintenance” says Dennis Blumenthal chief of helicopter maintenance for the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACoFD). “Overall it’s a stellar piece of equipment that supports an amazing multi-mission helicopter.”Currently outfitted with a fleet of five the LACoFD was the first organization to field the Firehawk. According to Blumenthal it took the department very little time to realize that the aircraft would be a game changer for the multi-mission helicopter world. “Without a doubt” he says.The department also uses GE Aerospace’s TrueChoice Flight Hour services an engine maintenance plan that helps operators optimize their cost of ownership over the entire lifecycle of their engine assets.In North America and Europe which are both facing longer fire seasons and larger wildfires such multi-mission capabilities can be a crucial asset. After researching various aircraft options the City of San Diego Fire-Rescue Department purchased its first Firehawk.“Ultimately we chose the Firehawk for its ability to carry as much as 40 percent more water than the other recommended aircraft” Chuck MacFarland chief of air operations at the City of San Diego Fire-Rescue Department wrote in an article in 2021 for the International Fire Chiefs Association . “Cabin volume speed mission endurance lower direct operating cost reliability situational awareness 4-axis coupled flight director and price among other performance comparisons also were considered in our decision.”“More than just a firefighting asset” he noted “our new aircraft is multi-mission-equipped for hoist rescues and advanced life support.”At first glance the Firehawk might seem like any other helicopter but there is much more than meets the eye. Beyond its critical role supporting firefighters in mitigating the devastation caused by wildfires the Firehawk’s meticulous design enables it to take on an array of missions with efficiency and precision from air medical support and troop transport to technical rescues. All of which is made possible by the rugged and reliable T700 engine.With decades of experience and more than 100 million hours of proven performance the T700 is the engine of choice for the harshest military and civilian environments around the world.“These aircraft successfully take on some of the most austere conditions you can imagine and we couldn’t be more proud to be the power behind the unique missions that brave firefighters encounter on a daily basis” says Elissa Lee executive director commercial rotorcraft programs at GE AerospaceIn the world of emergency response the Firehawk stands as a symbol of hope in uncertain times. Whether its disaster relief rescue missions or transport this multi-mission helicopter exemplifies the best of what technology and human effort can achieve. As these flying marvels continue to evolve they’re sure to be an enduring and invaluable asset in the fight to tame the unruly forces of nature and all manner of challenges in an ever-changing world.,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9jaGluYS1haXJsaW5lcy1ib2VpbmctNzQ3LTQwMC1mLWVuZ2luZS1zZXJ2aWNlcy1hZ3JlZW1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China Airlines Partners With GE To Support Its Boeing 747-400F Engines,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9jaGluYS1haXJsaW5lcy1ib2VpbmctNzQ3LTQwMC1mLWVuZ2luZS1zZXJ2aWNlcy1hZ3JlZW1lbnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1pbGl0YXJ5YWVyb3NwYWNlLmNvbS9zZW5zb3JzL2FydGljbGUvMTQzMDIwNjQvYm9laW5nLWF2aW9uaWNzLW5hdmlnYXRpb24tYWVyaWFsLXRhbmtlctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,avionics navigation aerial tanker,"WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB Ohio – U.S. Air Force aerial refueling experts are asking the Boeing Co. to build 15 new KC-46A Pegasus military aerial tanker aircraft under terms of a $2.3 billion order announced Tuesday.

Officials of the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Ohio are asking the Boeing Defense Space & Security segment in Seattle to build the KC-46A aircraft for the Air Force.

The KC-46A aircraft is based on the Boeing 767-200 widebody passenger jet. The multirole aerial refueling and strategic military transport aircraft can refuel all U.S. allied and coalition military aircraft compatible with international aerial refueling procedures. In addition to refueling other aircraft in midair the KC-46A also can carry passengers cargo and medical patients.

The KC-46A aircraft can detect avoid defeat and survive threats using several layers of electronic protection that enable it to operate safely in medium-threat environments Boeing officials say.

But on the bright side you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. Long term General Electric Company ( ) shareholders would be well aware of this since the stock is up 107% in five years. And in the last month the share price has gained 12%. But this could be related to good market conditions -- stocks in its market are up 8.4% in the last month.

Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns.

There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).

During the last half decade General Electric became profitable. Sometimes the start of profitability is a major inflection point that can signal fast earnings growth to come which in turn justifies very strong share price gains. Given that the company made a profit three years ago but not five years ago it is worth looking at the share price returns over the last three years too. We can see that the General Electric share price is up 44% in the last three years. During the same period EPS grew by 34% each year. This EPS growth is higher than the 13% average annual increase in the share price over the same three years. Therefore it seems the market has moderated its expectations for growth somewhat.

The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).

We know that General Electric has improved its bottom line over the last three years but what does the future have in store? It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free .

What About Dividends?

When looking at investment returns it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings along with any dividends based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of General Electric it has a TSR of 182% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.

A Different Perspective

It's good to see that General Electric has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 84% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 23% over half a decade implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario this may hint at some real business momentum implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight we need to consider other information too. For example we've discovered (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should be aware of before investing here.

GE HealthCare and Hologic have used a radiology meeting to push their artificial intelligence capabilities this week presenting technologies designed to improve diagnostic workflows.

BTIG analysts spoke to both companies at the Radiological Society of North America’s annual meeting. The analysts said that GE HealthCare management believes AI can help clinicians and radiologists do their jobs better which is important due to the “ongoing shortage of radiologists and the high rates of burn out.”

The analysts also shared an upbeat update from GE HealthCare which said hospitals have become more optimistic on capital budgets for next year and there is no lingering impact from China’s anti-corruption campaign.

Dive Insight:

GE HealthCare and Hologic have both invested in AI to enhance their offerings to radiologists in recent years. In February GE HealthCare disclosed an agreement to buy Caption Health a provider of AI that assists in conducting ultrasound scans in a deal later revealed to be worth $127 million upfront. The BTIG analysts shared their thoughts on the technology after visiting GE HealthCare’s booth at the event.

“We saw the power of Caption Health and the value additive features it offers on cardiac ultrasound applications. Within 6 months of the acquisition [GE HealthCare] has integrated Caption Health's technology into their own ultrasound equipment” the analysts wrote in a note to investors. “The features are primarily used in ERs but we would expect to see the features move to other ultrasound areas over time.”

GE HealthCare’s management identified four applications for AI in radiology: improved image quality enhanced user capabilities and efficiency diagnosis and quality control. The technology could boost productivity according to the analysts particularly in ultrasound.

Hologic used the event to promote its Genius AI Detection 2.0 solution deep-learning technology for flagging potential breast cancer cases. The company has linked the technology to a more than 70% reduction in false-positive markings per case compared to its own ImageChecker CAD solution.

“Version 1.0 used machine learning algorithms back in 2003 but it had to teach the software what to look for” the BTIG analysts wrote. “Today with Version 2.0 deep-learning capabilities allow fellowship trained radiologists to enter and mark up a few mammography images and the software can learn just from looking at prior data and the software goes pixel by pixel.”

Story continues

Away from AI GE HealthCare provided a broader update on some of the macroeconomic forces that will shape its financial results and those of its peers in the coming quarters. The company’s internal survey data suggests hospitals are becoming more optimistic about their capital budgets a change that could drive purchases of imaging equipment and management was encouraged by a recent trip to China.

GE HealthCare grew revenue year over year by 5% to $4.8 billion in the third quarter despite hospitals operating with more constrained budgets and China’s anti-corruption campaign.

Image courtesy: GE HealthCare

December 1 2023 — In today's healthcare environment the industry faces various pressing challenges. The magnetic resonance (MR) field is experiencing growing demands for precise imaging and diagnosis increased productivity all amid a global shortage of radiologists and patient backlogs. During the Radiological Society of America Scientific Sessions and Annual Meeting RSNA 2023 GE HealthCare showcased a number of AI and deep learning enabled solutions that help address these challenges including the introduction of the new SIGNA Champion wide bore magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. An overview of the systems provided by the company follows.

SIGNA Championii





An MRI can be an uncomfortable exam to undergo especially for patients who are dealing with complex and painful conditions or who are claustrophobic due to the narrow spaces in an MRI scanner. Wide bore MRIs are increasing in popularity as they can create a more comfortable exam for these patients. However there is a cost barrier that comes with these solutions that some health systems cannot afford. At RSNA 2023 GE HealthCare introduced SIGNA Champion – a new MRI system designed to enhance the standard care of MRI exams for patients everywhere by democratizing advanced AI and innovative features to help enable faster and more precise MRI scans.

While more patients gain access to MRI technology every year they undergo a wide variation of quality comfort & overall experience from their scans. Enabling equity in both the quality and experience of every MRI exam is equally as important as improving access to MRI for patients around the world.

SIGNA Champion is designed to stand out as an exceptional high-performance 1.5T wide bore MRI system powered by a variety of GE HealthCare innovative breakthroughs technologies:

• AI & Deep Learning – SIGNA Champion is designed to offer several AI-enabled workflow features like AIR Recon DL and Sonic DL supporting efficiency and delivering image quality excellence for users of all experience levels.

• Sustainability and Operational Benefits – SIGNA Champion is GE HealthCare’s smallest footprint and most power efficient 1.5T wide bore system. SIGNA Champion is designed to support broader affordability configurability and upgradability to support services expansion for health systems.

SIGNA PET/MR AIR

Prostate cancer and Alzheimer’s Disease are both highly prevalent worldwide. The unique AIR technologies GE HealthCare incorporated in the SIGNA PET/MR AIRiii scanner will directly impact these and other similarly challenging diseases that are difficult to diagnose and treat. For instance:

• Prostate cancer: The combination of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) targeted PET radiotracers with GE HealthCare's high sensitivity PET and the anatomical precision of MRI in the SIGNA PET/MR AIR holds the potential to help clinicians make a more precise diagnosis and staging/re-staging of prostate cancer. Additionally it can aid in the selection of patients for subsequent PSMA-targeted radioligand therapy.iv

• Alzheimer's Disease: The recent approval of PET amyloid tracers and new Alzheimer's treatments require imaging of patients with MR and PET. SIGNA PET/MR AIR offers the industry’s most sensitive Time-of-Flight (ToF) PET detector in a PET/MR helping to enable clinicians achieve early diagnosis track disease progression and detect adverse side-effects in a single scan.

SIGNA PET/MR AIR delivers deep learning-based MR image reconstruction with AIR Recon DL helping to ensure both improved image quality and up to 50% reduction in scan time.v

GE HealthCare's AIR Coils offer a thinner lighter solution allowing for more accurate PET quantitation when compared to conventional rigid RF coils and enhance patient comfort.

MotionFree Brainvi PET is a breakthrough solution on SIGNA PET/MR AIR that addresses and manages patient movement during imaging and without external tracking devices. Images affected by motion on the SIGNA PET/MR AIR can be corrected even after the patient has left the scanner. MotionFree Brain helps to ensure consistent image quality even for patients who may find it difficult to remain still potentially enabling faster and more accurate diagnosis while minimizing the potential need for repeat scans.

The introduction of the SIGNA PET/MR AIR system demonstrates GE HealthCare’s commitment to empowering healthcare professionals to deliver exceptional care and improve patient outcomes in the ever-evolving landscape of medical imaging.

Sonic DL

Sonic DL is a deep learning-based technology designed to dramatically accelerate image acquisition in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Having first received FDA clearance for cardiac imaging Sonic DL enables new imaging paradigms such as high-quality cardiac MRI in a single heartbeat. This breakthrough expands GE HealthCare’s industry-leading AI-enabled solutions in its Effortless Recon DL portfolio.

Cardiac MRI is the gold standard for assessing the structure and function of the heart in cardiovascular disease – however its adoption globally remains relatively low in part due to lengthy scan times. The current acquisition speed of MRI is too slow to capture the heart's contraction in real time requiring several heartbeats and multiple breath-holds for the patient. This process is time-consuming prone to image quality degradation and exhausting for patients.

Consequently there is a pressing need to address the growing demand for fast high-quality and comfortable cardiac MRI technology. Sonic DL is designed to dramatically accelerate image acquisition in MRI with the ability to scan up to 12 times faster compared to conventional methods enabling rapid cardiac functional imaging in as fast as a single heartbeat matching the speed of MRI to the speed of physiology.

This advancement minimizes or removes the need for repetitive patient breath-holds simplifying procedures and expanding the pool of patients eligible for cardiac MRI to include arrhythmic patients and those with difficulty holding their breath or the inability to remain still. Sonic DL’s capability to reduce cardiac MRI scan times by up to 83%vii also helps enhance productivity in radiology departments streamlining workflows – thereby reducing the burden on staff. Sonic DL’s AI-enabled technology tracks the beating heart with unparalleled image quality and overcomes the limitations of conventional acceleration techniques.

The innovation behind Sonic DL is a testament to GE HealthCare's commitment to advancing MRI through AI deep learning technology. GE HealthCare’s goal is to expand this technology across all anatomies. The combination of Sonic DL and AIR Recon DL represents a powerful solution suite for improved speed and image quality in MRI exams.

We're not talking about a remote-start function in a dedicated app either— ""Phone-as-key"" tech allows your smartphone to act as your car's key letting you keep it in your pocket while you unlock the doors start the engine and drive off with no traditional key fob onboard. New though it may be we're certainly getting used to it in our Genesis G90 yearlong test car. Maybe a little too used to it actually; we had to bail on our first service appointment after showing up at the dealership without the physical key fob.

Yes that means the G90's technology has moved beyond the accommodations of contemporary dealer service bays. We were told the actual key is necessary as you can't exactly hand over your phone to a porter and expect the service techs to then pass it around as the car moves around the dealership's service area. Leaving a key in the cupholder is much easier. Lesson learned! That minor inconvenience aside (we simply rescheduled our service for a later date; driving home to get the key then back to the dealer would have pushed us well beyond our appointment window) the phone-as-key feature has proven generally reliable and convenient.

Genesis dubs its phone-as-key tech Digital Key and it relies on near-field communication (NFC) Ultra-Wide-Band and Bluetooth (depending on your phone) to connect with your car as you near it unlocking the doors and allowing you to start the car. We set it up almost immediately after taking possession of the G90 earlier this year and have had plenty of time to evaluate its ups and downs.

Technically in its second iteration as Genesis Digital Key 2.0 earlier versions had the same functionality but required you to take out your phone and swipe it near the car's door to unlock it which is still required if your phone only uses NFC. Once inside you'd need to place your phone on the wireless charging pad to start the car. On our G90 the (UWB-equipped) phone can stay in your pocket; simply approach the car and the doorhandles pop out you can hop in step on the brake hit the starter button and go.

Setting up the key is simple. On our iPhone (it's also Android friendly) we first needed the Genesis owner's app which allows for remote starting door locking and unlocking and diagnostic checks among other widgets. In the utilities menu scroll to Digital Key then set up a new key; the app the nasks you to go into your vehicle and run through the setup menu to follow a sequence of commands. Complete those brief steps and the ""key"" is added to your Apple Wallet.

That last part is key pun intended because it offers users an on-screen backup for entering the car or remote starting it that runs outside of the Genesis app. In this author's phone the Genesis G90 key lives at the top of the Apple Wallet menu. Tapping on it brings up a screen with buttons for locking or unlocking the car starting the climate control (remote start) or firing off the alarm. It's almost like—get this—the sort of controls you get on a standard remote key fob. Like a regular fob these buttons are only active within a short distance from the car. If you're farther away you must use the Genesis app.

Getting Comfortable Going Keyless

Let's start by stating we've never been locked out of the G90 using the Digital Key function. That said we've faced occasional waits when approaching and trying to unlock the car; this is where that Apple Wallet menu comes in handy. When your wife is glaring at you while impatiently swatting at the G90's retracted door handles trying to get them to deploy and it's rainingandyou have a baby in a stroller with youandthe G90 is taking its time recognizing your phone key it's helpful to have a button you can press to make it seem like you're moving things along. In all seriousness we've found that in situations where the G90 isn't unlocking even with the phone right next to the handle simply opening the G90 wallet menu and hitting the ""unlock"" button does the trick.

The only other snafu we've noticed is even after unlocking the door and entering the Genesis without issue it has on occasion taken a few beats to recognize the key and allow you to start the engine. Typically in these situations a message appears in the digital gauge cluster display beckoning you to place the phone on the wireless charging pad essentially a fallback to Digital Key 1.0 functionality. Doing so gets the car to fire without issue.

These minor issues aside we quickly grew comfortable with leaving our key fob at home. So much so that this author regularly parks the G90 at the airport leaving it for days at a time and confident that upon returning the car will rely only on the phone key to start and get home. In fact the only times the key's been used in the past several months has been for service visits and trips including both this author's significant other and infant; the former didn't want to take any chances with the latter potentially being stuckoutsidethe air-conditioned car during Texas's hotter months. Eventually this precaution was dropped.

But Wait There's More!

One of the cooler features on Digital Key is the ability to send keys to others virtually. And it's dead simple: On an iPhone open the G90 tab in your Apple Wallet and press the send button (the same button you use to send links photos etc. to your friends). You can then choose from among your contacts and send the key to one via Messages; after selecting a recipient you're asked what sort of permissions to give the new keyholder. Access Levels include Valet Unlock Only and Unlock and Drive. The Valet function allows full use with restrictions; Unlock Only only manipulates the door locks. Unlock and Drive gives full use.

We tried this out during MotorTrend's 2024 Truck of the Year program in Detroit. After driving the G90 to Michigan from Texas we left it at the airport for social media editor Jofel Tolusa. While he was in the air flying in from our L.A. headquarters we sent him the G90 key told him where to find the car and that was it.

OK we left the physical key at the parking lot's office just in case but Jofel reports it was easy to add the Digital Key to his wallet and he was able to walk up enter and start the G90 without issue. (He then had to swing around to the office to grab the key we left him.) We later rescinded his key privileges not because he did anything wrong but to figure out how to do that for this story. Sorry Jofel. That said managing keyholders and their permissions can be done in the Apple Wallet tab via the people button next to the send key button or via the Genesis app.

The last entry-related widgets we've yet to try are the keycard option (though our G90 didn't come with one—so the hunt begins) and the fingerprint scanner on the center console. We've been in no particular hurry given how slick the phone-as-key function works—and after all when do you not have your phone with you?

According to the latest data from Insider Intelligence (also known as eMarketer) YouTube is the only platform that provides banking information for 60% of Millennials and 60% of Gen Z.

To put together its data set Insider Intelligence surveyed 1488 banking consumers in the United States. The study aimed “to understand how consumers open new bank accounts or buy bank products/services” with a focus on “channels that make consumers aware of banking brands and products/services the sources they use for research the factors that drive conversions and the influences on their loyalty and advocacy for these brands and products.”

The report arrives during a moment of cultural prominence for #FinTok the TikTok community that offers financial advice to viewers. #FinTok stars have accumulated millions of followers and some of them have even gotten face time with President Biden.

Insider Intelligence’s findings confirm that TikTok is a significant banking resource for Gen Z (ages 18 to 26) with 43.8% of that cohort seeking advice from finance TikTokers. Among Millennials (ages 27 to 42) the figure is lower topping out at 24.1%.

Those numbers are lagging behind the equivalent figures for YouTube. 65.6% of Gen Z and 63.9% of Millennials turn to Google’s video platform for banking info. Among Gen Z YouTube leads all platforms in that category. Among Millennials YouTube and Facebook are tied for the #1 spot.

The Insider Intelligence data tells a different story than the one shared by Vericast in a 2022 report. In that survey of Gen Z financial habits a similar number of respondents said they have accessed TikTok and YouTube when searching for financial guidance. But if Insider Intelligence is to be believed those percentages may not be as even as they were a year ago even with all of the cultural influence #FinTok exerts.

As far as financial brands are concerned the results are clear: Both YouTube and TikTok offer opportunities to reach consumers who are learning how to manage their money.

Work locations will be determined with each order. The contract is expected to be completed by Apr 12 2028.

What’s Favoring General Dynamics?

Rising geopolitical tensions perceived threats and the need to guard national interests are resulting in nations consistently reinforcing their defense capabilities. This has led to augmented spending on military arms and ammunition that play an integral role in military missions.

Such increased defense spending on military arms and ammunition often translates to a boost for companies like General Dynamics renowned for their extensive expertise in the designing engineering and production of munitions energetics weapons armaments and missile subsystems worldwide.

Consequently the company witnesses a consistent order inflow for its manufactured arms and ammunition like the latest one. The latest order win for M1128 which is an eight-wheeled assault mobile gun system for the Stryker family reflects the significant demand that this product enjoys thereby boosting the revenue generation prospects of General Dynamics.

Growth Prospects & Peer Moves

Going forward per the report from the Markets and Markets firm the global ammunition market is poised to witness a CAGR of 3.7% over the 2021-2026 period. This could lead to additional contracts for arms and ammunition procurement for General Dynamics. Such a consistent order inflow is likely to boost GD’s order book and backlog.

Other defense majors poised to benefit from the expanding ammunition market are Lockheed Martin LMT RTX Corporation RTX and Northrop Grumman NOC.

Lockheed Martin provides a wide variety of highly effective and reliable weapon systems. These weapon systems include precision strike weapons with long standoff ranges and smart submunitions to give the warfighter maximum flexibility and fire support mobile artillery and guided munitions to dominate the battlefield.

Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 8.6%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales suggests a growth rate of 0.9% from the prior-year reported figure.

RTX manufactures ammunition ranging from shoulder-fired weapons to extended-range precision munitions. Its product portfolio includes Excalibur projectile and a few more.

RTX’s long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 9.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales suggests a growth rate of 10.5% from the prior-year reported figure.

Published in The Ploughshares Monitor Winter 2023

In June 2023 the Canadian Commercial Corporation (CCC) announced a landmark arms deal with the Colombian Ministry of National Defense valued at $418-million (CAD). The deal covers the design manufacture delivery and in-service support of 55 light armoured vehicles (LAV IIIs) by General Dynamics Land Systems-Canada (GDLS-C) of London Ontario.

Selling LAVs to the southern market

The six-year arms deal is Canada’s largest-ever to any country in Latin America and the Caribbean. The ultimate end-user of the LAV IIIs under the 2023 contract will be the Colombian Army which along with the rest of Colombia’s armed forces is undergoing modernization. The LAV IIIs will reportedly be armed with Samson 30mm Remote-Control Weapon Stations (RWS) produced by Israel-based Rafael Advanced Defense Systems.

Colombia first procured 46 Canadian-made LAVs following two contracts in 2013 and 2014. The 2023 contract would therefore bring the total number of Canadian LAVs in Colombia’s arsenal to 101.

Latin American states Peru and Chile have also procured GDLS-C LAVs over the last decade. In all these cases the CCC signed the deals on behalf of GDLS-C. As a result the Government of Canada is ultimately responsible for the terms of these contracts guaranteeing deliveries to these Latin American governments and payment to GDLS-C.

The appeal of the LAV

GDLS-C has produced and sold thousands of LAVs over decades of activity with its largest customers Saudi Arabia and the United States.

The LAV is an eight-wheeled combat vehicle. But despite its name it is not “light”; the variant destined for Colombia boasts a maximum weight of more than 20000 kilograms.

LAVs are flexible in use and can be deployed by both conventional militaries during armed conflicts and by police and security forces in urban settings. LAVs have seen extensive use in conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. As well they were deployed to the war in Yemen by the Saudi government which also diverted some to Yemeni forces. During the Arab Spring the Saudi National Guard diverted a segment of its LAV-25 fleet to the Kingdom of Bahrain to violently suppress protestors.

Other sales to Colombia

Between 2012 and 2022 Canada exported military goods worth $56.1-million to Colombia. Included were some Canadian-made INKAS armoured vehicles that were reportedly deployed during nationwide protests in 2021; photos of their involvement were circulated on social media networks according to Peace Brigades International-Canada.

Colombia has also purchased Canadian military aerospace goods. According to documents obtained by The Maple Bell Helicopter Textron Canada is under contract to provide four 412 helicopters to the Colombian Navy and four 407 helicopters to the Colombian National Police; the documents also indicate that the CCC is pursuing a further contract on behalf of Viking Air to provide the Colombian Ministry of National Defense with Twin Otter aircraft.

Accusations of human rights abuses

Colombian security forces have recently been condemned for using excessive force against civilians on several occasions with some civilians killed. Such circumstances should raise red flags for Canadian officials when they are evaluating the potential that Canadian military goods including LAVs could be used to commit human rights violations in Colombia.

Following more than a year of social unrest in Colombia in April 2021 tens of thousands of Colombians took to the streets to oppose proposed tax and healthcare reforms by the government of President Iván Duque Márquez. Colombian security forces including the national police and particularly the Mobile Anti-Disturbances Squadron (Escuadrón Móvil Antidisturbios or “ESMAD”) responded with excessive force. Instead of quelling protests the crackdown helped to fuel a more rigorous reaction: a national strike (Paro Nacional).

Colombian security forces in turn stepped up their violent response. Human Rights Watch’s World Report 2022 linked the deaths of 25 protestors and bystanders to Colombian security forces most from the firing of live ammunition. According to the report the Colombian Ombudsperson’s Office also received reports of more than 100 instances of gender-based violence. Amnesty International reported that some protestors were forcibly disappeared by the government and determined that the actions of Colombian security forces during the National Strike contravened international law.

According to Colombian human rights organization Defender La Libertad more than 100 cases of eye trauma were caused by the widespread and frequently indiscriminate firing of non-lethal ammunition into crowds; some Colombians were left permanently blind. On some occasions national police fired from moving armoured vehicles. Reports also indicate that state repression during the National Strike disproportionately affected Indigenous and Afro-descendant populations.

Although the 2023 Canada-Colombia LAV contract was officially announced by the CCC this past June Colombian media began reporting on the deal as early as May of 2022. Given that negotiations for deals of this size typically occur over long periods it appears likely that negotiations between the CCC and the Colombian Ministry of Defense occurred during the National Strike and repression by Colombian authorities which began in April 2021 and persisted in different forms throughout the year.

Arming human rights abusers

In response to abuses by security forces during the National Strike human rights organizations have called on states to stem the flow of arms to Colombia as those arms could be used against civilians and in instances of excessive force. Amnesty International Canada urged the Canadian government to suspend arms transfers to Colombia until “Colombian security forces fully comply with international law and standards on the use of force.”

Most abuses during the National Strike were tied to the Colombian National Police and ESMAD which has since been reformed under the current government of Gustavo Petro. The end-user of the CCC’s 2023 LAV deal has been listed as the Colombian Army which is distinct from the National Police.

However both the National Police and the Army fall under the jurisdiction of the Colombian Ministry of National Defense raising serious questions about the ability of the Ministry to ensure that the bodies under its control observe human rights obligations.

States Parties to the Arms Trade Treaty including Canada must refuse arms transfers if officials believe that there is a substantial risk that those exports could result in human rights abuses.

The recent 2023 Canada-Colombia LAV contract Canada’s largest-ever arms deal to a country in Latin America and the Caribbean was lauded by the CCC as a success story for Canadian manufacturers. At the same time however the contract is sending more Canadian-made military goods into an environment in which human rights violations and breaches of international law have been widely reported.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFpbm9ubGluZS5jb20vYXZpYXRpb24tbmV3cy9kZWZlbnNlLzIwMjMtMTItMDEvYm9tYmFyZGllci1sb3Nlcy1jYW5hZGlhbi1wYXRyb2wtYWlyY3JhZnQtYmlkLWJvZWluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bombardier Global 6500 Loses Canadian Patrol Aircraft Bid to Boeing P-8A | AIN,"Bombardier Loses Canadian Patrol Aircraft Bid to Boeing

The sector is sensitive to geopolitical tensions changes in federal military spending and the advent of military conflicts. Despite underperforming the broader stock market in 2023 the current war between Israel and Hamas along with a healthy 2024 National Defense Authorization Act could be a catalyst for purchases in the months ahead. Indeed the Congress and the Biden administration have budgeted $842 billion for military spending next year an increase of $26 billion over 2023 levels and $100 billion more than 2022 which doesn't include supplemental bills that could pass increasing military spending for aid to Ukraine and Israel.

Investors can monitor the sector's performance through the iShares U.S. Aerospace & Defense ETF (ITA) which acts as a proxy exchange-traded fund that holds a portfolio of industry bellwethers like the Boeing Company (BA) Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT) and General Dynamics Corporation (GD). The fund has returned 7% over the past year trailing the broad-based Russell 1000 index by 8.6% over the same period.

Last week a jury ruled that the egg producers used several methods to limit the domestic supply of eggs to increase the price of products during the 2000s.

While the exact time frame of the alleged conspiracy was debated throughout the case jurors eventually concluded damages occurred between 2004 and 2008.

Food manufacturers joining as plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the egg producers are Kraft Foods Global Inc. The Kellogg Company General Mills Inc. and Nestle USA Inc.

The damages awarded could be tripled under U.S. antitrust law to more than $53 million. It capped the second phase of a two-part trial against Cal-Maine Foods (CALM.O) which is the country's largest egg producer and distributor and Rose Acre Farms the second-largest over claims that they overcharged for egg products.

""We are extremely grateful for the jury's service and findings. This was an important case for many reasons and the jury's award recognizes its significance"" Brandon Fox an attorney representing the food manufacturers said in a statement.

The same Illinois jury held the egg producers responsible for the alleged antitrust conspiracy after a more than five-week trial but Ridgeland Mississippi-based Cal-Maine and the other defendants had denied any wrongdoing.

In a statement Cal-Maine called the damages amount ""modest"" compared to what the plaintiffs sought. The company also added that it will ""continue to evaluate its options including if necessary an appeal.""

Officials stated that Cal-Maine would also have to share responsibility for the damages award with the other three defendants.

Rose Acre also issued a statement saying it was ""disappointed — and strongly disagrees — with the jury's verdict and damages award.""

The planned closure of the facility reflects Post’s need to reduce capacity in its cereal production network the company says. The Lancaster facility has approximately 200 employees and is expected to close by the end of September 2024. Facility production capabilities will be transferred to other Post Consumer Brands manufacturing locations.

Regarding the closure Post Consumer Brands president and CEO Nicolas Catoggio says “We are continuously optimizing our network so that we can best serve our customers and consumers. This facility closure enables Post Consumer Brands to continue offering a diversified portfolio of great products at a great value.”

The Lancaster facility has been part of the Post Consumer Brands business since June 2021 when Post acquired the TreeHouse Foods ready-to-eat cereal business.

Post Consumer Brands has engaged in discussions with the union representing employees at the Lancaster facility and has notified employees of the decision.

Post currently expects to incur cash and noncash pre-tax charges totaling approximately $49 to $55 million in connection with the transfer of production capabilities to other Post Consumer Brands locations and closure of the Lancaster facility. Completion of the transfer and startup of production at other locations is estimated to require capital expenditures of approximately $20 million incremental to Post’s previously announced capital expenditures guidance range of $400 to $425 million in fiscal year 2024. As a result of the transfer of production capabilities to other locations and closure of the Lancaster facility Post expects to achieve annual cost savings of approximately $23 to $25 million starting in fiscal year 2025."
GM,General Motors,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vYXBuZXdzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2dlbmVyYWwtbW90b3JzLXBhdGgtdG8tZWxlY3RyaWMtdmVoaWNsZS1wcm9maXRhYmlsaXR5LWJiYTNhOWNiYmQyYWFkMDk1M2NiYzExM2U1M2QwNDFj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM believes it will start making money on electric vehicles in 2025 as higher margin models arrive,"DETROIT (AP) — General Motors is losing money on every electric vehicle it sells but the company says it’s on track to generate mid single-digit pretax profit margins in 2025 as it produces more higher margin EVs works out kinks in battery manufacturing and sees battery cost reductions.

That’s what Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson told analysts at a Barclays conference in New York on Thursday conceding that the company has struggled to ramp up electric vehicle manufacturing. “While the ramp has been a little bit bumpy we have worked through that” he said.

Specifically the company has had trouble with machinery that stacks battery cells into modules at its assembly plants after the cells are produced at a battery plant near Warren Ohio a joint venture with LG Energy Solution of Korea.

The guidance on Thursday of mid single-digit profit margins in two years is a little better than the low-to-mid single digits the company has estimated in the past Jacobson said. But the new figure includes benefits from U.S. government clean energy tax credits.

Jacobson said current margins on electric vehicles are “substantially negative” as the company builds battery plants retools factories and then underutilizes them as EV production and demand grow.

While the rate of electric vehicle sales growth has slowed in the U.S. this year Jacobson said demand continues to rise. The company still plans to build factory capacity to manufacture 1 million EVs per year by the end of 2025 but it won’t make all of them if the demand isn’t there. “I don’t want to stuff vehicles into a market that doesn’t want them” he said adding that GM also doesn’t want to sell EVs at big discounts.

The growth of U.S. electric vehicle sales has slowed sharply since last year. In June 2022 EV sales were growing about 90% year over year. By June of this year the 12-month growth rate had slowed to about 50% and it remained there at the end of October. Automakers have become increasingly fearful that the pace may weaken further due to consumer concerns about high prices a lack of charging stations and whether they will run out of juice.

GM is rolling out a series of electric SUVs including an Chevrolet Equinox with a starting price of close to $30000 as well as a Chevy Silverado EV pickup truck GMC Hummer EVs and some Cadillac SUVs. It also plans to come out with a new version of the Chevrolet Bolt in 2025.

The company expects to make the EVs profitable by spreading costs over more vehicles as sales increase by selling more higher-cost/higher profit EVs and with battery cost savings Jacobson said.

Shares of GM which on Wednesday announced a $10 billion stock buyback program and a 33% dividend increase rose about 1% to $31.82 Thursday.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAxL2dtLWZpbmFsbHktcHV0cy1zaGFyZWhvbGRlcnMtZmlyc3Qtc2hvdWxkLXlvdS1idXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GM Finally Puts Shareholders First. Should You Buy the Stock Now?,"General Motors just announced an eye-popping share buyback. Here's why it could be a game changer.

General Motors (GM 0.01%) stock was surging on Wednesday after the automaker surprised investors with a $10 billion accelerated share repurchase program and raised its dividend by 33% to $0.12 per quarter.

The automaker also reinstated its guidance after pulling it earlier during the United Auto Workers strike. It believes that the strike will cost it $1.1 billion in operating profit primarily due to lost production. The company's now expects net income of $9.1 billion-$9.7 billion for the year down from a previous range of $9.3 billion-$10.7 billion. On an adjusted earnings per share (EPS) basis GM expects $7.20-$7.70 in profits for the year compared to earlier guidance of $7.15-$8.15.

As part of the accelerated share repurchase program the company said it would work with its banking partners to immediately repurchase and retire $6.8 billion worth of its stock and it plans to finish the share repurchase program by the end of next year.

It's easy to see why investors are cheering. The dividend hike and aggressive share repurchase program are the kind of shareholder-friendly moves that typically elicit a warm response from the market and the stock was also well positioned to benefit from such a move.

GM's hidden opportunity

Even after today's stock gains GM shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 4.2 based on the revised guidance. That's the kind of valuation that's normally reserved for dying companies or is caused by a one-time boost in profits. Neither of those descriptions applies to General Motors which remains a healthy business though its industry is in the midst of an assumed transition to electrification while autonomous vehicles are also expected to eventually disrupt the industry though that could still be in the distant future.

Still GM has prepared itself for these transitions investing billions in its electric vehicle (EV) platform and it acquired Cruise AV back in 2016.

CEO Mary Barra said she believes GM stock is undervalued yet until now the company has been reluctant to make the seemingly obvious moves to buy back its stock and raise its dividend. Over the last five years shares outstanding declined only slightly and the $10 billion share buyback is an important step toward correcting that.

Factoring in Wednesday's gains the company now has a market cap of $43.3 billion meaning that a $10 billion buyback would reduce its shares outstanding by 23% lifting EPS by 30%. The immediate $6.8 billion repurchase will lower shares outstanding by 16% increasing EPS by 19%.

Similarly GM's dividend hike seems long overdue but it increases the dividend yield only modestly from 1.13% to 1.51%. Considering how cheap the stock is on a P/E basis the automaker still has room to raise its dividend yield significantly.

Is GM stock a buy now?

Even after the aggressive share buyback and dividend hike GM still has a lot of room to pull those levers at the current stock price.

The company expects to generate $10.5 billion-$11.5 billion in adjusted automotive free cash flow this year. That cash is what's left over after funding the business and it's typically used to pay down debt acquire new business and return to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks.

The $10 billion share repurchase authorization indicates that the company intends to favor share buybacks over dividends as even after the dividend hike it's allocating roughly only $650 million a year to dividends. If GM continues to prioritize returning cash to shareholders while the stock is this cheap the share price should continue to move higher.

GM does face challenges and Barra acknowledged as much in the update noting that delays in the Ultium EV platform have been disappointing and she promised to revamp its Cruise AV program after its vehicles were pulled off the road in California and Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt left the company.

However no auto stock has an easy path to growth these days as EV sales have slowed across the industry and high interest rates have pinched customers. Even Tesla has seen revenue growth slow to single digits and profits fall.

At its current price GM stock looks like a smart buy. The core business continues to generate strong profits. It's adjusting its cost structure to absorb increased labor expenses after the strike and it's making needed investments to prepare for the transition to EVs and autonomous vehicles.

When General Motors acquired Opel in 1929 Alfred P. Sloan Jr then the CEO of GM thought it would cement his company as a giant in the European market. It did for a time. Opel thrived under GM for a decade and by the time World War II began it was the largest automaker in Europe.

Just as the '70s rolled around Opel remained popular in Europe holding the title of a reliable car brand and beating its fierce Volkswagen competitor in Germany. However this success was relatively short-lived and as GM switched its focus to the balance sheet instead of quality Opel saw a decline in its market share.

The first idea to sell Opel was in 2009. The then-CEO of GM Fritz Henderson tried to pitch the move to the board but was denied. Henderson's attempt to sell GM's majority stake in Vauxhall and Opel wasn't far-fetched seeing as General Motors navigated its way out of a murky bankruptcy.

Fast forward to March 6 2017 and Henderson's too-early suggestion became a prophecy. General Motors ultimately backed out of Europe selling Opel and Vauxhall for $2.2 billion (a loss) to PSA Group the French manufacturer behind Peugeot and Citroen.

But why couldn't GM make a comeback in Europe? What led it to let go of its European holdings?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG93ZWVrLmNvbS9uZXdzL2E0NjAxMTQ2OC9mb3JkLWh5YnJpZHMtZ20tZXZzLWJhcmNsYXlzLWNvbmZlcmVuY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford Leans on Hybrids While GM Banks on EV Profitability,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.autoweek.com/news/a46011468/ford-hybrids-gm-evs-barclays-conference/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG93ZWVrLmNvbS9uZXdzL2E0NjAxMTQ2OC9mb3JkLWh5YnJpZHMtZ20tZXZzLWJhcmNsYXlzLWNvbmZlcmVuY2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vc2ZzdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8wMS9jcnVpc2UtZnV0dXJlLWdtLXB1bGxiYWNrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruise Robotaxis: What's Next as GM Pulls Investment?,"GM announced it would curtail spending on Cruise in the neighborhood of “hundreds of millions of dollars” a drop-off that comes as little surprise to observers of the troubled driverless car startup. A string of snafus across San Francisco culminated in a frightening collision that led to a woman being severely injured—she is currently in stable condition—and federal and local probes into Cruise which pulled its entire fleet from the road.

Seven years and a few billion dollars later GM is now making a U-turn away from its large-scale investments in Cruise begging the question of where exactly the company goes from here.

Core to GM’s transition was spending a pretty penny to snag Cruise in March 2016 which at that point was just a fledgling startup fresh out of the Y Combinator incubator.

For much of Mary Barra’s term as chief executive officer of General Motors she’s branded the stalwart automaker—in earnings calls marketing and public appearances—as a player in the technology space.

For Cruise that means a leaner team with a greater focus on sustainable scaling and safety; for GM that means focusing efforts away from a self-driving electricity-fueled future to deal with the gas-powered human-controlled present.

Auto industry analysts and technology experts who spoke to The Standard say the companies will likely have to go back to basics and rethink previously optimistic projections.

“Once we have taken steps to improve our safety culture and rebuild trust our strategy is to relaunch in one city and prove our performance there before expanding” a Cruise spokesperson told The Standard.

This week’s announcement serves not just as a blow to Cruise’s declining fortunes but also as a major setback to General Motors which until recently bet big on Cruise as a key part of the company’s future.

“When something like this happens it just kind of puts further doubt in the consumer mind around the longevity the safety the adoption” said Nathan Shipley an auto industry analyst and executive director at market research firm Circana. “From a business standpoint you have to pull back and examine things.”

‘They Just Had To Go Full Throttle’

Barra told a South by Southwest crowd last year that she anticipated consumers would be able to purchase their very own autonomous GM-branded vehicle powered by the technology deployed on Cruise vehicles by 2025. Vogt speaking at TechCrunch Disrupt in September called the rise of personal self-driving cars “inevitable.”

“For the past five years I’ve covered GM they’ve always been the technology-forward car maker” said Gadjo Sevilla a senior analyst for the connectivity and technology industries at Insider Intelligence. “They would have a bigger presence at a technology show than they would at a car show because that's really their brand.”

While other carmakers not named Tesla have largely held off on introducing self-driving technology acknowledging the risks of introducing largely unvetted technology to the masses Barra and then-Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt made their ambitions clear for Cruise over the past few years.

Earlier this year Vogt also said Cruise was on track to make $1 billion in revenue by 2025. He stepped down from the company this month.

Meanwhile Barra said Cruise would be a key money generator for GM making up to $50 billion in annual revenue by 2030—even though the company was burning through $2 billion a year at the time. (Barra also suggested that GM’s revenue would double to $280 billion in that timeframe.)

Those claims were not entirely unfounded said Billy Riggs a University of San Francisco professor and director of the school’s Autonomous Vehicles and the City Initiative.

He explained that the projections likely were based on Cruise moving full-speed ahead on expanding its autonomous vehicle service and rolling out its higher-capacity Cruise Origin driverless van. GM has since paused production on the autonomous van.

“Unlike Waymo” Riggs said “they had a really aggressive scaling strategy.”

Integral to Cruise’s rapid growth was spending a ton of cash to expand into new markets and push forward Origin’s development he added.

“Cruise felt they just had to go full throttle—no pun intended” said Sevilla who noted the company has burned through $8.2 billion since 2017. “And with that comes the danger of not really being able to anticipate real-world situations.”

In a stockholder letter released in July shortly before Cruise secured state regulatory approval to expand in San Francisco Barra pointed to Cruise as one of its “highest-impact growth initiatives.”

In an apparent effort to maintain its first-mover status Cruise according to reports and former employees’ accounts accelerated too quickly and eschewed safety in the process. Bloomberg reported last week that Vogt allegedly softened safety review metrics in order to expand nationwide more quickly.

Barra said Cruise is undergoing an independent review alongside its plans to relaunch in one unspecified city. That doesn’t answer the question of whether Cruise can regain the public’s trust. Even if California regulators reinstate Cruise’s permit to operate Sevilla and Shipley say the stain of the past few months will still linger."

The parts were discovered during assessment in Texas and Brazil over the past few months and have since been removed from the engines the low-cost carrier’s chief executive Michael O’Leary told Bloomberg News.

It comes as the global aviation industry is grappling with a fake parts scandal that has left airlines and regulators scrambling to assess engines and trace equipment.

Aviation regulators have accused an obscure London company called AOG Technics of supplying thousands of engine parts with faked certification documents for Airbus and Boeing models including older-generation 737s used by Ryanair.

Delta Air Lines American Airlines and Southwest Airlines are among the carriers reportedly that found suspect parts.

The Civil Aviation Authority said in August that it has been investigating the supply of a “large number of suspect unapproved parts” through AOG Technics.

Mr O’Leary said the Irish airline has never conducted business directly with AOG receiving the component for two engines instead via third parties.

He added the carrier remains “largely unaffected” overall by the scandal.

Airlines were told to check their stocks of spare engine parts after reports around AOG started circulating earlier this year according to Mr O’Leary.

The discovery of so-called fake parts comes after Ryanair was forced to make changes to its winter schedule after Boeing delayed deliveries of aircraft.

The setback prompted Mr O’Leary to say he could scrap future orders if the US aviation giant continued to miss delivery targets.

In October he said: “It is frustrating because the demand for travel is very strong and we think there are a lot of competitors who are going to be grounding their aircraft.”

The company said to be at the centre of the scandal AOG Technics has been accused by US engine giant General Electric and its French business partner Safran of large-scale fraud that they allege has led to fake or old parts being falsely installed into more than a hundred engines.

The airline’s CEO Michael O’Leary revealed that these suspect parts were found during assessments conducted in Texas and Brazil.

These findings come amidst a broader issue in the aviation industry regarding counterfeit parts supplied by a company called AOG Technics affecting various airlines and regulators worldwide.

AOG Technics has been accused of providing thousands of engine parts with falsified certification documents for Airbus and Boeing models including older-generation 737-800s used by Ryanair. Although Ryanair claims it never directly conducted business with AOG and received these components through intermediaries the airline removed the suspect parts from the engines.

Other airlines such as Delta Air Lines American Airlines and Southwest Airlines also reportedly found similar suspect parts. This discovery adds to Ryanair’s challenges following Boeing’s delays in aircraft deliveries leading to adjustments in their winter schedule. O’Leary even mentioned the possibility of cancelling future orders if Boeing continued to miss delivery targets.

AOG Technics the company at the heart of the controversy faces allegations of large-scale fraud from major engine manufacturers General Electric and Safran. AOG’s founder Jose Zamora Yrala denies these accusations as he battles the claims against his company.

Ryanair despite being affected by these discoveries maintains it is mostly unaffected overall by the scandal.

We also streamlined our order processing to handle overseas shipments and maintain a larger stock of critical items for quicker repairs” said Wan Hazran.

“Additionally we have launched the Proton Operational Excellence (POE) programme. This is to level up our dealer operation management capability. In this programme the dealer will be evaluated based on six focus areas which are performance customer satisfaction parts management customer management manpower and compliance” he added.

“With this platform the dealer will be evaluated to deliver the best customer satisfaction. This has been a challenge for us to give our best commitment in our ability to address all the challenges promptly and professionally. In this case we are improving our aftersales especially for parts supply and so far I believe there are not much issues on part supply. This is our commitment to all Proton customers that we are improving to be the best in aftersales” Wan Hazran ended.

The issue of spare parts availability was widely reported over the past two years with customers having to wait a long time to get their vehicles repaired or serviced – the matter even caught the interest of the transport ministry in 2022.

In the time since reports of Proton’s lack of spare parts availability surfaced the carmaker has worked hard to address the issue by requiring its dealers to have a minimum number of months holding stock of fast-moving parts – this was announced in March last year.

The POE programme mentioned by Wan Hazran was launched later on in November 2022 for better aftersales excellence and in February this year Proton launched a new regional parts centre (also mentioned by Wan Hazran) in Kuching to reduce lead time for parts in East Malaysia by 30%.

The parts were discovered during maintenance checks in Texas and Brazil during the past few months.

Major US carriers Delta Air Lines American Airlines and Southwest Airlines have also found suspect parts in their planes.

Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary said the bogus components came from the British supplier AOG Technics which is not one of Ryanair’s approved suppliers.

Regulators have been alerted to fake parts found in Boeing and Airbus planes this year and investigators have allegedly traced the supplies back to AOG Technics. Aviation watchdogs in the UK US and Europe have accused the company of supplying engine parts with faked certification documents raising concerns over safety.

Mr O’Leary called for tighter control of third-party jet engine suppliers. US engine maker CFM International has taken legal action against AOG Technics after its CFM56 model – the world’s most widely used jet engine – was allegedly affected by the scandal.

The Civil Aviation Authority Britain’s watchdog has issued a safety notice to airlines and said it was ‘investigating the supply of a large number of suspect unapproved parts’ that could it said be traced back to AOG Technics.

The EU Aviation Safety Agency said in August it was examining reports of parts with suspected falsified documents while the US Federal Aviation Administration has warned airlines about the scandal. The US Justice Department is said to be in the early stages of a probe.

AOG Technics did not respond to a request for comment last night."
GILD,Gilead Sciences,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9naWxlYWQtc2NpZW5jZXMtaW5jLW5hc2RhcS1naWxkLTE0MDAxMjI3Mi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Gilead Sciences Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GILD) ROE Of 26% Impressive?,"While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip) this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. We'll use ROE to examine Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) by way of a worked example.

Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.

Check out our latest analysis for Gilead Sciences

How Is ROE Calculated?

The formula for return on equity is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So based on the above formula the ROE for Gilead Sciences is:

26% = US$5.8b ÷ US$22b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).

The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity the company generated $0.26 in profit.

Does Gilead Sciences Have A Good Return On Equity?

Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below Gilead Sciences has a higher ROE than the average (17%) in the Biotechs industry.

That's what we like to see. Bear in mind a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Gilead Sciences by visiting our risks dashboard for free on our platform here.

How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?

Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings) issuing new shares or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options the ROE will reflect this use of cash for growth. In the latter case the debt used for growth will improve returns but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather metaphorically speaking.

Combining Gilead Sciences' Debt And Its 26% Return On Equity

It's worth noting the high use of debt by Gilead Sciences leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.12. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily because credit markets do change over time.

Summary

Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal a higher ROE is better.

Having said that while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price must be considered too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.

Those new cancers could result in “serious outcomes including hospitalization and death” the FDA stated while adding that “the overall benefits of these products [CAR-T therapies] continue to outweigh their potential risks for their approved uses.”

At issue are cases of T-cell malignancies including CAR-positive lymphoma in patients who received treatment with BCMA- or CD19-directed autologous CAR-T immunotherapies.

The FDA said it had received 19 reports of new blood cancers in patients receiving CAR-T treatments for various cancers in the six years since the first two such therapies were approved—Kymriah® (tisagenlecleucel) marketed by Novartis (NVS) and approved in August 2017; and Yescarta® (axicabtagene ciloleucel) approved four months later and marketed by the Kite Pharma subsidiary of Gilead Sciences (GILD).

Of the 19 reports cited by the agency 12 were cases of T-cell lymphoma reported by patients using the FDA Adverse Events Reporting System (FAERS). Other cases came to the FDA’s attention through clinical trials.

The news was enough to send shares falling on Tuesday morning for some CAR-T drug developers—notably those with such treatments in their pipelines or smaller biotechs. Among pipeline companies Autolus Therapeutics (AUTL) shares took the biggest tumble nosediving 35% from Monday’s close of $4.78 to $3.11 at 12 p.m. before finishing the day at $4.55 only a 5% single day drop. But shares skidded another 10% Wednesday to $4.08 before partially rising 5% to $4.27 Thursday as of 11:35 a.m.

Faring better was Arcellx (ACLX) whose shares slid 8% from its Monday close of $53.21 to $49.01 at 12 p.m. before finishing Tuesday down 4% at $51.10. Arcellx lost another 1% Wednesday before upticking 3% to $52.20 as of 11:35 a.m.

Among approved CAR-T therapy developers Legend fell 7% from Monday’s close of $61.56 to $57.42 as of 12:30 p.m. before rising again to $59.99 a 3% one-day decline.

Giants hardly budge

Significantly J&J and other biopharma giants with approved CAR-T treatments hardly budged:

BMS declined just 0.3% from $49.02 at Monday’s close to $48.85 at 3:30 p.m. finishing the day 1% higher at $48.92.

from $49.02 at Monday’s close to $48.85 at 3:30 p.m. finishing the day at $48.92. Gilead dipped 0.8% from $74.92 Monday to $74.30 at 1:30 p.m. before inching up 0.2% to finish at $74.51.

from $74.92 Monday to $74.30 at 1:30 p.m. before to finish at $74.51. J&J also slid 0.3% from $151.28 to $150.88 at the start of trading Tuesday then rallied to end the day up 0.5% at $151.63.

from $151.28 to $150.88 at the start of trading Tuesday then rallied to end the day at $151.63. Novartis fell 1% from $97.74 to $96.67 at the start of Tuesday trading but finished up 0.3% to an even $97.

All five makers of approved CAR-T therapies didn’t budge much Wednesday closing anywhere from down 1% (Arcellx) to up 1% (Gilead).

Kymriah and Yescarta are two of six CAR-T cancer immunotherapies approved by the FDA. The other four are Abecma® (idecabtagene vicleucel) marketed by Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS; stock ticker BMY); Breyanzi® (lisocabtagene maraleucel) also marketed by BMS; Carvykti™ (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) marketed by Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)’s Janssen Biotech and Legend Biotech (LEGN); and Tecartus® (brexucabtagene autoleucel) marketed by Gilead.

$2.766 billion and growing

Revenues for the approved CAR-T treatments reached a combined $2.766 billion in the first nine months of this year with most of them therapies growing significantly year-over-year.

During January-September 2023 Gilead generated the most in CAR-T sales reporting $1.13 billion for its blockbuster Yescarta (up 37% from $823 million a year earlier) and another $272 million for Tecartus (up 25% from $217 million).

Next highest was BMS with $372 million for Abecma (up 41% from $263 million) and $263 million for Breyanzi (up 107% from $127 million) then Novartis with $388 million from Kymriah (down 2% from $397 million). Following closely is J&J’s $341 million from Carvykti (more than quadruple zooming 332% from $79 million—not counting Legend’s $152 million in Q3 net trade sales plus a $131.2 million increase in collaboration revenue due to increased revenue from Carvykti sales).

Baird senior research analysts Brian P. Skorney and Jack K. Allen and colleagues said they expected only a limited impact on the commercial use of CAR-T therapies in later lines of treatment given the desperation of patients and physicians in severe refractory B-cell malignancies as well as the FDA’s affirmation of a favorable risk/benefit profile.

But the growth strategies for CAR-T therapies generally involve label expansion into earlier lines of treatment according to Skorney and Allen—such as Yescarta’s effort to add an indication for second-line diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

“T-cell malignancies tend to be rapidly progressing cancers with few treatment options. Thus we believe this update may impact the therapeutic index calculation for regulators and prescribers when it comes to earlier lines of treatment and less aggressive forms of B-cell malignancies (e.g. CLL follicular lymphoma)” Skorney and Allen observed. “While this dynamic could limit the commercial potential of CAR-T products in earlier line indications given the substantial number of unknowns here it is difficult to quantify the potential effect.”

“Substantial hurdle” for autoimmunity

They added that the potential for T-cell malignancy a rare but highly fatal side effect “is likely to present a substantial hurdle for expansion into autoimmune indications where the expected tolerance for safety events is expected to be substantially diminished relative to oncology indications.”

That explains according to the analysts why immunology CAR-T cell therapy developer Cabaletta Bio (CABA) plummeted 27% on Tuesday from $18.70 to $13.69. Since then Cabaletta has risen 17% to $13.88 on Wednesday and $16.05 on Thursday.

“Development focus may shift to increase attention on T-cell malignancy rates” Skorney and Allen forecasted. “As a product of this investigation and any subsequent regulatory action we expect that biotechs focused on the cell therapy space are going to heighten their focus on T-cell-related adverse events going forward. Although the mechanism behind the induced malignancies appears to be uncertain currently we expect this side effect may become a larger focus for biotechs with commercialized cell therapies and those currently in the development stage.”

Of the 19 cases that sparked the FDA investigation 12 were T-cell related malignancies. That number contrasts with the 46 total CAR-T related cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 60 of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) reported to FAERS John Newman PhD an analyst with Canaccord Genuity wrote Wednesday in one research note.

“Ultimately we expect FDA to conclude that the risk of CAR-T cells becoming or causing T-cell cancers is low and manageable but we await the conclusion of FDA’s investigation” Newman predicted in a second note to investors. “We suspect FDA will better quantify the risk of serious outcomes after T-cell cancers following CAR-T therapy and then update product labels accordingly.

He cited the fact all CAR-T therapies already have a class warning in place for the potential of developing secondary malignancies.

“Importantly if FDA has serious concerns they could have halted ongoing CAR-T trials and/or halted treatment of patients with approved CAR-Ts” Newman added. “The fact that they did neither suggests overall risk is manageable in our view.

More than half of the 12 T-cell malignancy cases (seven) were from patients treated with Kymriah. Another three were treated with Yescarta and one each with Breyanzi and Carvykti. No cases arose from Abecma and Tecartus patients.

“Patients and clinical trial participants receiving treatment with these products should be monitored life-long for new malignancies” the FDA advised.

However Newman cautioned: “Importantly we do not know the total number of Carvykti and Abecma patients treated. We also do not have T-cell malignancy data on any CAR-T products still in clinical studies.”

Global Finance: Why form strategic relationships with technology partners?

Mark Frey: We have several technology partners across our business some of which are service providers for our infrastructure needs and some that directly support our commercial organization and how we attract and create value for clients. In both categories we see it as mission critical to have true transparency and alignment in what we aim to achieve and how that partner contributes to value creation. Suppose the partner is aligned in how we define our immediate and longer-term goals; that takes us to how we can generate mutual value in terms of the commercial aspects of our relationship. Ideally we build models with partners where they benefit from our success and the more value we can derive from their capability in the marketplace the more we can generate economics they can share in. Our view is that technology and commercial partnerships work best when we are completely aligned in terms of what we’re trying to achieve and how we’ll share in the value generated.

GF: How are fintechs helping small and midsize enterprises manage foreign exchange risks?

Frey: The fintech sector has successfully improved access to financial products and services by leveraging client-centric technologies. In the B2B space there are a significant number of customer segments that have experienced a material improvement in access to financial services especially risk-management services because fintechs have taken capability down-market to small businesses and consumers in addition to building sector-specific solutions for particular industry verticals that have previously had difficulty either accessing or customizing solutions for their specific use cases. Fintechs have been successful in this democratization by leveraging technology and sector-specific applications that customize generic financial services and products to the needs of an industrial sector or segment of customers. Fintechs by definition can be more targeted in their go-to-market strategies than the big banks and often pick particular segments of the economy in which they can develop a competitive advantage. In building and deploying innovative technologies in this targeted way fintechs like us have made it economically viable to service specific segments with tailored product offerings that big banks which appeal to a broad-based audience simply can’t do at scale.

GF: How have you created a seamless FX trading solution?

Frey: When we think of FX trading and risk management we focus on organizations that move money across borders at scale in terms of absolute currency volume and the number of payments. Our focus then is to help deliver risk-management pretrade planning budgeting and strategy tools that can ultimately be executed and turned into payments to vendors or accessed in terms of incoming accounts receivable solutions. By focusing on both the FX risk-management strategy and how those FX risks can be broken down into the payments at a line-item level we have been able to create value for our clients by allowing them to streamline their planning and budgeting process while also ensuring operational efficiency in terms of actually moving or receiving FX currency. We provide tools and analysis that help clients manage their currency risk while assisting them to move money across borders at scale with precision and efficiency. We’ve focused our technology on the intersection of these two areas—leveraging technology to provide insights and reporting that leads to more timely and effective risk-management decisions with a platform that automates processes regarding the movement of funds.

GF: What are your predictions for cross-border payments and currency risks in 2024?

Frey: Regarding the big macro picture we expect that currency markets will be more volatile in the future than they have been in the past. Whether from escalating geopolitical tensions diverging interest-rate expectations per currency or a historically strong USD we expect volatility to rebound from a somewhat subdued period. The world will also get smaller and businesses will continue to look beyond their borders for expansion opportunities thereby driving cross-border payment and FX trading volumes higher in the years ahead.

According to a recent report in The Economic Times the RBI is now in talks with its counterparts in the US and Hong Kong besides the Society for Worldwide InterBank Financial Communications (Swift) the global financial messaging system on the prospects of launching digital cross-border settlements. The goal is to make global payments faster and cheaper for both individuals and companies.

This is not just forward-looking move but a logical one too especially since India appears to have done the hard yards on launching a central bank digital currency or CBDC. With a robust domestic payments system in place to help people move money instantly and cheaply the attraction of a CBDC for resident Indians is limited.

Where India’s CBDC holds considerable promise is in cross-border payments. For individuals and companies into global trade and services moving funds across countries is not only costly but also painfully slow. To make cross-border payments they must use the Swift platform which relays financial messages between banks. Since both banks must approve the transfer it isn't completed instantly as with UPI or even within a short time as with the National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) system.

Over time there has been a growing feeling that Swift’s transaction costs are far too high. A CBDC could address this problem as the transaction be settled primarily between two central banks with an intermediary bank involved only at the end of the transaction.

In the wake of economic sanctions against Russia including the freezing of its central bank’s assets there have been informal talks among a few countries about working on an alternative system for cross-border payments. Though there hasn't been much headway on the matter one option would be to enter into bilateral agreements to obviate this.

Since a CBDC opens up the possibility of eliminating an intermediary while ensuring lower transaction costs it could serve as the Swift alternative that countries have been looking for. The main draw of course is the difference it will make to the millions of people living abroad who remit funds to their families back home and to multinational companies.

Exciting as this sounds though it brings with it multiple challenges. These include deciding the exchange rate for cross-border transactions bilateral agreements between countries and the speed at which various countries launch CBDCs. India has already launched a CBDC pilot. The volume of transactions critical to a full-fledged launch aren't sizable yet. This may be partly due to the popularity of UPI.

Then there are counterparties. The US which has also started work on a CBDC may not be in a hurry to do so and would prefer to get the process right. The UK has also signaled that the earliest unveiling if the project is operationally and technically feasible would probably be in the second half of this decade.

What all this also shows is that since few countries have the equivalent of a UPI there is a great window of opportunity to take this payment platform global. If other countries adopted India’s public digital infrastructure large swathes of the global economy could speed up their adoption of CBDCs for cross-border transactions not involving Swift.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiIWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhd24uY29tL25ld3MvMTc5NDI0NNIBJWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhd24uY29tL25ld3MvYW1wLzE3OTQyNDQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Zindigi and Visa forge strategic partnership elevating payment solutions,"A strategic partnership between Visa and Zindigi - Powered by JS Bank aims to promote financial inclusion and digital transformation facilitating digital payments across the merchant network in Pakistan.

Should Investors Follow His Lead?,"Berkshire Hathaway trimmed several longtime holdings in the third quarter including this stock it has held since 2001.

Warren Buffett's track record of success is undeniable. Since becoming chief executive officer of Berkshire Hathaway in 1965 Buffett and his team have produced 20% returns compounded annually. In other words if you invested $1000 in Berkshire Hathaway when Buffett took the reins and let it grow over time you would have nearly $3.8 million today!

Buffett and his team's long track record of investing success is a big reason investors eagerly await Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly form 13-F. The Securities and Exchange Commission legally requires this filing from institutional investors which discloses their quarterly investing activities.

Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller in the third quarter trimming $7 billion while buying $1.7 billion in stocks. Globe Life (GL) was one stock Berkshire reduced significantly from its holdings selling 1.7 million shares or 67% of its total stake. Globe Life is one of the longest-held stocks in Berkshire's portfolio which it first bought in 2001. Should investors follow Buffett's lead?

Berkshire Hathaway has held Globe Life through challenging times

Globe Life is a holding company for a group of insurance companies that serve lower-middle to middle-income households in the U.S. It sells life and supplemental insurance with policies covering cancer intensive care and supplemental Medicare. It also has an investment portfolio mainly fixed-income assets earning interest income.

Berkshire Hathaway has owned stock in Globe Life since 2001 (known as Torchmark until 2019) and held it through a challenging time for life insurers during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020 and 2021 Globe Life had $207 million in COVID-related claims costs with the bulk ($140 million) coming in 2021. As a result its life insurance underwriting margin narrowed by 8% while its net operating income fell by 4%.

Last year things improved for life insurers as COVID-related claims costs fell. Globe Life's related claims costs fell to $49 million during the year its life insurance underwriting margin jumped 23% and net operating income improved by 14%.

Buffett and his team have trimmed insurance stocks from Berkshire's portfolio in recent quarters

Buffett and his team at Berkshire held more than 6.3 million shares of Globe Life or about $756 million coming into this year. The conglomerate has since reduced its position over the past two quarters and now owns just 831014 or about 13% of its original stake.

While Berkshire didn't disclose why it sold its stake in the insurer we can look at the conglomerate's other selling decisions to glean some insight into potential reasons. In addition to Globe Life Berkshire sold some of its stake in the specialty insurer Markel and the insurance broker Aon. The move comes after it sold its remaining position in the insurance broker Marsh & McLennan which it held for a few years.

It's possible that Berkshire may not see as much upside for insurers including life insurers like Globe Life which have seen their stocks blast higher in the past couple of years as pandemic-related claims subside. Since its pandemic-era low Globe Life stock has rallied more than 110% as conditions in the life insurance market normalize.

However Globe Life isn't the only long-term holding Berkshire Hathaway sold in the third quarter. Buffett and his team eliminated their stakes in General Motors United Parcel Service Mondelez International Procter & Gamble and Johnson & Johnson -- all of which had been in Berkshire's portfolio for a decade or more. After the sales Berkshire Hathaway had a record $157 billion cash stockpile at the end of the third quarter.

Investors shouldn't be too concerned about Berkshire's selling

Despite Berkshire's selling Globe Life continues to post solid results. Through the first three quarters of this year revenue and net income were up 3.6% and 6.7% from last year respectively and it continues to post solid results in both its life and health businesses. The company continues to generate strong cash flow earning $14.60 in free cash flow per share during the past 12 months.

It should also continue to benefit from higher interest rates on its investment portfolio. Last year it saw the investment yield on its fixed maturity portfolio increase for the first time since 2008 and it should continue to benefit from tailwinds from the higher-for-longer interest rates. For that reason Globe Life investors shouldn't be too concerned with Berkshire's recent sale of the life insurer's shares.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vYXJ0cy9ib29rcy9hcnRpY2xlLWEtbGlmZS1zdXJyb3VuZGVkLWJ5LWJvb2tzLWlzLXRoZS1vbmx5LXdheS10by1saXZlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,An ode to a bookshelf: A life surrounded by stories is the only way to live,"Open this photo in gallery: Author Dawn Promislow writes ""Every room in my house except for the bathroom has books in it.""Oleksiy Mark/Getty Images/iStockphoto

My house has more books in it than it has cups or plates or forks and spoons or ornaments or pictures or towels and sheets or even clothes. Sometimes when I visit another house where there are few books or no books the state of my book-filled house seems to me strange and eccentric or odd at least. On the other hand I feel that living with many books around is the only way to live. I exaggerate – but not really.

Every room in my house except for the bathroom has books in it. Some of the bookshelves are makeshift and plain – a couple were castoffs found on the curb – but two of them are beautiful and dark wood and old. I would love more bookshelves and beautiful ones but I hardly have room. And I live with other people after all.

We asked three Canadian illustrators to draw their own bookcases and tell us a little bit about why their shelves reflect them

My husband has never said he appreciates living with books everywhere but I know that he does. I have known this about him since the first time he came to my apartment on Shallmar Boulevard in Toronto when I was 27 and he saw the huge white bookshelf filled with books. I knew by instinct that he loved all those books piled there as much as I did. That was 36 years ago and I was right in my instinct.

There is another person who is tied tightly in my mind with my books and that is my mother. This story – the story of my bookshelves – begins with my mother or come to think of it with my grandmother but more about that later.

My books are almost all fiction. I never really thought about that until now when writing this essay because I took for granted that the most magical and wonderful thing one can read is fiction and I imagined that everyone must feel the same.

Books we're reading and loving this week: Globe staffers and readers share their book picks

But as I cast my eyes over a bookshelf in my hallway I see non-fiction also: The History of Nantucket: County Island and Town; The English: A Portrait of a People; We Were Eight Years in Power by Ta Nehisi-Coates. Celtic Myths and Legends. The Japanese Mind. And so on.

I have a large number of reference books: English dictionaries many and French-English ones; Hebrew-English ones Yiddish-English ones and a single Afrikaans-English one. Several atlases of the world. The Canadian Oxford School Atlas third edition is there; it looks very worn and I think one of my children had it in grade three.

There are books about writing and writing style and works of literary criticism. Aspects of Macbeth. Seven Types of Ambiguity.

I have books about art and painting quite a few. One of them Impressionists and Impressionism is a large and lustrous coffee-table book with colour plates. It’s so large it fits on only one of the bookshelves the one with freakishly tall shelves.

As it turns out its size is apt for the space – the great and large space – this book holds in my mind. At the front of the book is my mother’s handwriting with the following inscription:

21.2.77

To dearest Dawn

Wishing you a very happy 17th birthday.

Tons of love

Mom and Dad

Which tells you something about how my mother fits into this story the story of my bookshelves. She is the beginning of the story as I’ve already said.

Books gift guide 2023: The best reads for everyone on your list

There are here and there on my shelves books in Hebrew. All of them are old and worn but they glint with the allure of things mysterious yet deeply familiar. They are prayer books that my husband brought with him from his childhood or prayer books that I have kept from my grandparents. In one my grandfather has inscribed:

To dear Zelma with love from Jack

18 September 1952.

It was a gift for Rosh Hashanah the New Year’s prayer book to my grandmother. It’s a small feminine-looking book with a mother-of-pearl cover iridescent. I’ve never seen another like it. I’d call it alluring in a sexual way were that not an odd way to describe a prayer book.

I can read Hebrew and scanning my shelves I feel a secret pleasure reading the Hebrew titles. Perhaps the pleasure is secret because I have absorbed as if by osmosis and in spite of myself a fear about being Jewish. Can this be true?

I feel the pleasure to be secret in any case. It is secret and that’s that. (Although I’ve told you now.)

And speaking of Hebrew: I own every single work of Amos Oz most of them novels. But in English; I read them in English. I adore the work of Amos Oz. I once lent six of his books all at once to a friend and regretted it instantly. I’ve not got them back yet because I keep forgetting to ask her.

And this is part of having bookshelves of books isn’t it that one feels compelled to recommend books to other people; compelled to press upon other people books one has loved. In this way books are about love about reaching the hearts of other people and telling them something – and love always comes into that doesn’t it?

Over the course of my life I have lived on three continents. The books I acquired in my first life in South Africa were taken with me to London England to my second life where they gathered more books unto themselves and were then taken to Toronto to my third life. I have never thrown away a book on any of these journeys or at the beginning or end of these journeys. Although I’ve lent books I’ve never given a book away. Or sold one. This is quite true. I am unable to get rid of a book.

I have duplicates of books; I keep them. I have different editions of the same book; I buy them on purpose. But I have exact duplicates of some books. I realize here that this is eccentric. Impractical certainly.

Speaking of impractical. I am quite disorganized by which I mean I don’t care much about order. So my books are not in any order. This makes it difficult to find a particular book at any one time and so I spend (waste) quite a bit of time looking for one book or another. On the other hand I don’t consider that a waste of time. Looking at my books looking through my books is never a waste of time because I find it deeply comforting. And here we come to the crux of the matter: comforting.

When I sit in a room a room in my house I always have a view of a shelf of books. Casting my eyes over such a shelf I feel comforted and energized at the same time. I think it is because of books’ inexhaustibility. I will never be bored because I always have a book to pick up.

My mother loved books and read books because her mother – my grandmother – loved books. My grandmother read novels. At the end of her life she was in a retirement home on Don Mills Road in Toronto and I would visit to find her waiting for me in the lobby a hardcover book open on her lap. She was fastidious about using bookmarks. She would be reading.

And perhaps the most beautiful bookshelf in my house is one that belonged to my grandmother. She used it not as a bookshelf but as a cabinet for ornaments china and glass ornaments. No matter. She is the one who read and loved books. I should add that this cabinet – this bookshelf – lived in my grandmother’s house in a small town in the Orange Free State province in the middle of the veld in South Africa. So it has travelled quite a way.

My mother for her part was a librarian and a collector of antiquarian books and of all books. A couple of my bookshelves are filled with antiquarian books that she gave me. The shelves are wedged where there’s room so they’re easy to miss in my house and antiquarian books are most often dun-coloured and faded with time: a dusty navy a deep worn green. I love them unreasonably.

I have an idea that my books are a bulwark against some great loss that looms behind me in my mind. Behind me? Or in front of me? I’m not sure. It’s a sense of loss of impending or past loss that I live with every day.

Perhaps the books might act as an insurance or protection of some kind. My rational mind knows there can be no insurance against loss; yet one tries one tries to build a defence book by book bookshelf by bookshelf.

I never imagined or dreamed that I myself would write a book.

It was relatively late in my life (in my forties) when I realized that stories I was writing were publishable. The stories became my first book my short story collection published in 2010. And now in 2023 I have two books that I’ve written that are on bookshelves on my bookshelves. But they are also on bookshelves all over: in book stores in public libraries and on other people’s home bookshelves. This seems to me beyond miraculous.

I do believe that books carry everything by which I mean they carry our heritage they carry our ideas they carry who we are. They are us. This is why I cannot get rid of a book because it feels like a death to get rid of a book. I know and realize that these feelings I have verge on the irrational but I own them (the feelings; the books).

In honor of the 250th anniversary of Phillis Wheatley ’s poetry collection “Poems on Various Subjects Religious and Moral” the fifth annual Pierce Performance at the Boston Public Library will center on the first published Black American poet’s life poetry and legacy . The free event hosted by the Associates of the Boston Public Library on Dec. 4 in the library’s Rabb Hall will feature writers and artists Ade Solanke Porsha Olayiwola Meredith Bergmann and others to highlight Wheatley’s work preserved in the library’s Rare Books Department .

The first scene is based on Wheatley’s poem “To S. M. A Young African Painter On Seeing His Works” and imagines an encounter between Wheatley and Scipio Moorhead a young enslaved painter on the eve of her departure to London. The second scene imagines Wheatley almost a decade after the publication of her poetry collection and focuses on the poet as a wife and a mother mourning the loss of her two children.

“In spite of all the trauma of being kidnapped and being brought to America through the horrendous Middle Passage I just still find it astonishing that she was able to reorganize gather commit and develop herself to the point where she could write what was then the most revered art form in the world: poetry” Solanke said.

Lisa Rafferty a playwright director producer and professor at Bridgewater State University will moderate a discussion with Solanke after the scenes are performed. Meredith Bergmann the sculptor of the Boston Women’s Memorial and Kyera Singleton the Royall House Museum’s executive director will also join the panel.

“We’ll be talking about the intersection of art and theater and history particularly women’s history” said Rafferty. “I think it’s going to be a very dynamic very vibrant evening.”

To conclude the program Porsha Olayiwola  the City of Boston’s poet laureate will perform one of Wheatley’s poems as well as read some of her own Wheatley-inspired work.

“That’s what makes Phillis Wheatley Peters so relevant even 250 years later” said Vidisha Agarwalla communications and operations specialist at the Associates of the Boston Public Library. “That there are still Black women who are having their intelligence questioned their credibility or credentials questioned by the quote unquote professionals around them.”

“There were many people who actually did believe at that time that Africans couldn’t be taught to read and write. So I always say Phillis emancipated a lot of Europeans from their mistakes” Solanke said. “There’s so much human potential for peace … I really do believe we can create a better world. And I think her story is inspiring because it gives us a sense of the potential human beings have to overcome the worst that life can throw at us.”

After a dismal 2023 next year will be ""the year of the bond"" predicted Lindsay Rosner head of multisector fixed income investing at the money manager. ""Fixed income is a great place to be"" she said in an interview with CNBC. The investment firm recently released its outlook for 2024 and called the recent run of negative fixed income returns in response to ""an inflation and policy shock"" an anomaly and not the trend. ""Following a reset higher in bond yields the age of 'There Is No Alternative' (TINA) to equities or other risk assets has ended. We believe we are now in the early phases of 'There Are Reasonable Alternatives' (TARA)"" Goldman wrote. Bond prices tumbled after the Federal Reserve started hiking interest rates in early 2022. Since prices move inversely to yields that has provided an opportunity for investors to snap up additional income. Investors are now earning yields of 4% to 6% by buying bonds from high-quality companies twice the 2009 to 2019 average according to Goldman. More recently the tide has started to turn with Treasury yields falling in November and prices moving higher as traders grew increasingly confident the Fed is done raising rates to contain inflation. Goldman shares that belief. That means the risks fixed-income investors faced from duration  spread widening or defaults  are less of an issue Rosner explained. ""Duration was really painful over the past 18 months and truly the entire hiking cycle"" she said. ""We have gone to the other side of it and we are now in a very comfortable position from a duration perspective"" She also believes default rates will be average or lower than average and there won't be a lot of spread widening that will erase the total return calculation. How to play it The ending of the Fed's rate hikes is good news for intermediate-term investment-grade corporate and government credit according to Goldman. The assets have notably outpaced Treasurys on average in the last 12 and 24 months after each of the last four rate-hike cycles the firm wrote in its outlook. With that in mind Rosner believes it's time to move out of cash and short-term assets and start extending duration. Investors should also be thoughtful and remain high quality since rates are expected to remain higher for longer she said. The best way to do that is through active management since there will be very different outcomes depending on the companies and countries and the health of their balance sheets she said. ""Big picture we think you are really paid to be in high quality products — a mix of Treasurys investment grade high-quality structured products"" Rosner said. ""We are at this unique place where you can get real yield in high-quality assets"" she added. ""Given [that] duration can be your friend again things are lining up to put you in a really good position in fixed income."" — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed reporting."

One of the main goals for the Heat was to score as many points as possible as the Pacers have the best offensive rating in the NBA they did just that by scoring a season-high 142 points.

Miami head coach Erik Spoelstra and star Jimmy Butler spoke after the game to talk about the game-plan they had Thursday night. A huge goal was to disrupt dynamic point guard Tyrese Haliburton from setting the pace for Indiana throughout the game. While that wasn't accomplished in the first half the Heat turned it around in the final 24 minutes of regulation as Spoelstra said to ClutchPoints.

“It took us a long time but yeah. They do that to everybody. So it's not exclusive to us and they keep you on your heels. They do everything at full speed their processing speed in particular Halliburton seeing what your coverage is and then what are your weakness is it's impressive” Spoelstra said. “So you have to overcome that with multiple efforts disruption make them miss moments scramble and that's where we're at our best anyways. And you saw a lot of that in the fourth quarter.”

A season-best game for the Heat's Jimmy Butler

While they didn't maintain Haliburton in terms of his statistics as he scored a season-high 44 points and recorded 10 assists. 28 of those points came in the first half when the 23-year old set the pace but on the other side of the coin the Heat had a returning Jimmy Butler who missed the last two games with an ankle injury.

Butler scored a season-high 36 points and collected 10 rebounds in what was a signature aggressive performance from the 34-year old. Spoelstra said that the way Butler played is “part of his genius” and that his performance in the second half guided the rest of the team to the finish line.

“He felt it but you know that's part of his genius. Just whatever the game calls for and we have Bam out we have Tyler out you know there's some different lineups out there. And he just felt it and then settled everybody with just all those attacks. I mean it inspired the whole group and I think that inspired our defense to start making more efforts” Spoelstra said. “You know that third quarter was just really inspiring. Even those rebounds that he was getting in traffic you know just over the top of everybody. And you know the three point plays And once we took the lead I think it just gave the group confidence going into the fourth quarter and then that second unit again just gave us a great boost.”

Besides Miami scoring a season-high 142 points in total 45 of those came in the crucial fourth quarter. It's been a worrisome trend that the Heat play their worst basketball in the final period but they rewrote history Thursday.

Butler likes a faster pace

When the second half came around part of the Heat's halftime adjustments were to create their own pace and force Indiana to play by their rules. They did that and more but it was a new experience for Butler. While they don't usually play at a fast pace like that Butler said he likes the style.

“I mean I can't speak for everybody I speak for myself. I do like it. It's just freeform basketball. You got to make so many reads on the fly. But that's kind of like what today's game is anyways” Butler said. “It shows that we are capable of playing like that but that's definitely not our style of basketball. But a win is a win so I guess we got to start playing faster.”

Butler made nine of his 18 shot attempts but his biggest impact came at the charity stripe where he sunk in 18 of 20 free throws. The Heat's success against the Pacers can also be contributed to five other players besides Butler scoring in double-digits.

Butler gives credit to the Pacers' Haliburton

Haliburton was the obvious target for Miami as Butler acknowledged how impactful of a player he can be. He said to ClutchPoints that there's “nothing” the Pacers guard can't do.

“He be hooping. He plays Incredible basketball and he makes all the right plays over and over and over again. There's nothing that he can't do on the floor. He passes the ball well shoots the three ball well gets to the paint and finishes well” Butler said. “Obviously he's a big reason why they're winning so many games. He's gonna keep doing it man. He's gonna make sure that they continue.”

The three-game losing streak for the Heat is shattered and now they look for two straight wins as they get Indiana again this Saturday. They're currently 11-8 on the season which puts them at sixth in the Eastern Conference moving past the Pacers at seventh.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjMTduZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NyaW1lLzIwMjMvMTIvMDEvYXVkcmFpbi1jb3VudHktdGVlbi1jaGFyZ2VkLXdpdGgtcHJlbWVkaXRhdGVkLW11cmRlci1pbi12YW5kYWxpYS1hcmVhLXNob290aW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Audrain County teen charged with premeditated murder in Vandalia-area shooting,"VANDALIA Mo. (KMIZ)

An Audrain County teen was charged Friday with first-degree murder in the shooting of a man found dead on a county road.

Christopher D. Brickey 18 of Laddonia was charged with armed criminal action as well in the death of a person identified only as a ""victim"" in court documents later identified as Matthew Stewart.

Audrain County Prosecutor Jacob Shellabarger said Friday morning that charges against the suspect could be filed by the end of the day. They appeared in online court records a little after 2:30 p.m.

Shellabarger later identified Stewart in a Facebook post and said that a 17-year-old was also in the custody of juvenile authorities.

A hearing is scheduled for Tuesday morning and Brickey is being held without bond.

A 23-year-old man was found dead with gunshot wounds Thursday afternoon on County Road 556.

The Audrain County Sheriff's Office stated in a Facebook post that an investigation led to ""persons of interest being identified who have been located.""

A bond recommendation document says Brickey and an unnamed co-defendant -- the 17-year-old -- planned the victim's murder. Brickey and the juvenile drove the victim to the murder scene shot the victim then drove away the document says.

They fired multiple shots the document says.

Shellabarger said the motive was robbery -- the robbers wanted the victim's gun -- along with a feud between the victim and a shooter's family member the sheriff's office said Friday in a news release.

Deputies searched Brickey's home in Paris Missouri around noon Friday and found the murder weapon and the gun taken from the victim the release says.

A witness told investigators that Brickey the juvenile and Stewart met for a transaction with the gun and the two took Stewart to ""range test"" the gun according to a probable cause statement. The witness Stewart's roommate later got a call from Stewart saying ""They shot me"" the document says.

Brickey allegedly admitted to shooting Stewart with a .45-caliber handgun along with the juvenile.

(November 30 2023) – Hartford Public Schools is pleased to announce that it is the recipient of a five-year Full-Service Community Schools (FSCS) grant from the U.S. Department of Education for its student-centered approach to deepening support in community schools and its efforts to reimagine education.

The District will receive $2104428 over the next five years with $423190 available in Year 1. The funding will be crucial to supporting a Full-Service Community Schools model at M.D. Fox Elementary School Burr Middle School and Bulkeley High School. Hartford Public Schools staff will work with community partners to enhance the system of student support expand in-school and out-of-school programs and activities increase involvement of families and community and build capacity for collaborative leadership and professional development. Staff will track and evaluate the impact of these services on students at key transition points: preschool to Kindergarten Kindergarten to early elementary elementary to middle school and middle school to high school. The grant also allows for two new programs in career readiness and in crime and violence prevention and intervention.

“For over 13 years Hartford Public Schools has been committed to Full Service Community Schools (FSCS) that provide wraparound supports that help remove barriers to learning and ensure access to opportunities so our students can excel in the classroom and throughout their communities” said Nuchette Black-Burke Chief of Family and Community Partnerships at Hartford Public Schools. “The financial resources provided by the USDE will allow us to continue building on our Community School frame all in service of our students and families. We are honored to have received this grant award and appreciate the USDE for their commitment to Community Schools.”

“These new investments support what I’ve heard from parents and families across the country. Additional funding will deepen community partnerships and connect children and families to vital resources that meet their holistic needs. We know that comprehensive wrap-around approaches—including nutrition assistance; mental health services; early childhood education; and access to high-quality afterschool summer learning and enrichment programs—all are crucial for accelerating our students’ academic success and their recovery from the pandemic by helping them thrive both inside and outside of school” said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona.

Research indicates that positive learning environments where students receive key services—including nutritional dental vision and mental health services—are critical for accelerating academic recovery. Students learn better have increased attendance and are more engaged in their learning environment when their whole needs are met.

As a recipient of this grant Hartford Public Schools is demonstrating its commitment to implementing the four pillars of evidence-based community schools that improve achievement and other outcomes for students: 1) integrated student supports that address out-of-school barriers to learning through partnerships with social and health service agencies and providers; 2) expanded and enriched learning time and opportunities; 3) active family and community engagement; and 4) collaborative leadership and practices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9kYXZpZC1oZW5yeS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD01MzcyOTAzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Henry Obituary (1967 - 2023) - West Hartford CT - Hartford Courant,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/hartfordcourant/name/david-henry-obituary?id=53729034 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9kYXZpZC1oZW5yeS1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD01MzcyOTAzNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd2UtaGEuY29tL3dlc3QtaGFydGZvcmQtZmlyZS1kZXBhcnRtZW50LWV4dGluZ3Vpc2hlcy1ibGF6ZS1pbi1jb21tZXJjaWFsLWJ1aWxkaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,West Hartford Fire Department Extinguishes Blaze in Commercial Building - We-Ha,"A fire in a commercial building late Thursday night was knuckle knocked down by the West Hartford Fire Department.

By Ronni Newton

A small fire in a commercial building in West Hartford was quickly extinguished with no injuries Fire Chief Greg Priest said.

According to Priest dispatchers received an alert at 11:42 p.m. from a fire alarm in a commercial building at 595 Prospect Avenue which is just south of Farmington Avenue.

The first units arrived at 11:47 p.m. and found smoke visible in the rear of a one-story commercial building at which point the call was upgraded to a structure fire Priest said.

Additional units arrived at the scene and Squad 1 entered the building where they found a blaze in the rear of the structure near a heating unit located one the roof.

The deputy chief declared it a working fire and based on the visible conditions all other working units responded.

The fire was quickly knocked down with a single 2½-inch hose line Priest said.

The crews from Engine 4 and Ladder 3 opened the roof to ensure there was no fire extension and crews also searched the building and confirmed it was unoccupied and there were no victims.

The building was ventilated to remove the smoke and the West Hartford Fire Marshal is investigating.

During the short period of time when all five fire companies were on the scene Hartford and UConn Fire Department as well as American Medical Response provided mutual aid.

“As always West Hartford Fire greatly appreciates the assistance of the West Hartford Police dispatchers AMR and our other mutual aid partners from area fire departments” Priest said.

It’s understood that ahead of eOne and Lionsgate combining likely by the final week of December eOne workers have been told who will be welcomed into the Hollywood studio after the close of the sales agreement and which employees will not be taken on by Lionsgate or can continue through a brief transitional period.

In June 2023 eOne cut another 20 percent of its workforce as parent Hasbro looked to reduce overall costs at the toymaker and had put its film and TV unit up for sale. Hasbro acquired the Toronto-based studio in 2019 as part of a $4 billion all-cash transaction and announced its intention to sell eOne in mid-November 2022.

An earlier plan by Hasbro to have eOne expand the toymaker as a media contender with a film and TV unit of its own was overtaken by newly installed CEO Chris Cocks turning the company’s focus to becoming a digital gaming powerhouse after fending off a proxy battle with an activist investor.

Lionsgate eventually stepped forward to acquire certain assets of eOne including a content library of nearly 6500 titles and active productions for non-Hasbro owned IP like the Yellowjackets The Rookie and Naked and Afraid franchises as well as the eOne unscripted business.

The eOne film and TV business being sold also includes Hasbro’s interest in the Canadian film and TV operations of Entertainment One Canada Limited. Hasbro in turn after selling off eOne will focus on branded assets like Peppa Pig Transformers and Dungeons & Dragons as it looks to become a digital games giant.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmFyaWV0eS5jb20vMjAyMy90di9uZXdzL2xpb25zZ2F0ZS1sYXlzLW9mZi1lb25lLWVtcGxveWVlcy1tZXJnZXItY2xvc2UtZGVjZW1iZXItMTIzNTgxNjU2My_SAWhodHRwczovL3ZhcmlldHkuY29tLzIwMjMvdHYvbmV3cy9saW9uc2dhdGUtbGF5cy1vZmYtZW9uZS1lbXBsb3llZXMtbWVyZ2VyLWNsb3NlLWRlY2VtYmVyLTEyMzU4MTY1NjMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lionsgate Lays Off 10% of eOne Employees Ahead of Merger Closing Final Week of December,"Lionsgate has laid off 10% of Entertainment One‘s (eOne) workforce ahead of the closing of the merger between the two companies which is expected to be finalized the last week of December a source tells Variety.

It should be noted that layoffs previously hit eOne in June when then-parent company Hasbro reduced the studio’s staff by 20% amid its preparation to sell the asset — meaning this week’s cuts hit an already depleted group of employees.

In August Lionsgate struck a deal to purchase eOne‘s TV and film operations from Hasbro for $500 million. The sale news came nearly four years to the date when Hasbro announced their intent to acquire eOne in a $3.8 billion deal in August 2019.

Representatives for eOne and Lionsgate did not respond to request for comment on the layoffs Friday.

Popular on Variety

When Hasbro first revealed plans to sell its eOne assets last November the toymaker noted that the sale would include the parts of the indie studio’s TV and film operations “not directly supporting the company’s branded entertainment strategy” and that Hasbro would “maintain the capability to develop and produce animation digital shorts scripted TV and theatrical films for audiences related to core Hasbro IP.”

Popular IP excluded from the deal includes “Peppa Pig” “Transformers” “Dungeons & Dragons” “Magic: The Gathering” “My Little Pony” “Power Rangers” “Play-Doh” and “Clue.” (The pact does include film development rights for “Monopoly.”)

Under Hasbro’s control eOne announced in 2021 it would be laying off 10% of its film and television staff followed by the sale of the studio’s music division to The Blackstone Group for $385 million. By early 2023 Hasbro revealed that it would be laying off some 15% of its global headcount some 1000 positions.

By Foundation Staff

A partnership between HCA Florida Healthcare and St. Petersburg College (SPC) is helping train the area’s future caregivers and combat the state’s nursing shortage.

The College of Nursing at SPC partnered with HCA Florida Healthcare on the Linking Industry to Nursing Education (LINE) grant which incentivizes collaboration between nursing education programs and health care partners in reducing the shortage of nurses in the state. In October the SPC Foundation recognized an $80000 gift from HCA Florida Healthcare at a ceremony held at the Clearwater Campus.

“Estimates are the nursing shortage will grow to 59000 by 2030. Our partnership with St. Petersburg College is an excellent opportunity to change this and help ensure we have the nurses we need to care for our patients in the years ahead” said Leanne Salazar DNP MBA ARNP CENP CPPS CPHQ FNP-BC the Chief Nurse Executive at HCA Healthcare West Florida Division. “St. Petersburg College is a high-quality educator that not only provides well-trained nurses to our local community but also has an impressive pass rate for nursing graduates taking their state license exam. We continue to be excited about this partnership’s future.”

The money awarded through HCA Florida Healthcare provided $30000 in new equipment and supplies in support of SPC’s nursing programs.

The college also awarded 25 students a $2000 scholarship with the remaining funds.

“This scholarship helps students to not have to work or to work less. It can also help buy their books or to do whatever it is they need it to do so they can focus on their studies” said Dr. Leah Olson Academic Program Director at SPC. “Getting a nursing degree is very challenging and the college wants all students to be prepared to take care of people and the community.”

In addition the partnership with HCA Florida Healthcare helped SPC garner an additional $80000 in funding through the Florida Department of Education.

SPC continues to give students access to better jobs and a better future with the help of higher education.

“St. Petersburg College is affordable and accessible and I was able to move forward with my education because of SPC. The College of Nursing has met all my expectations” said Sandra Krause an SPC nursing student and scholarship recipient. “I am currently an LPN which has opened a lot of doors for me but becoming an RN will open a thousand doors for me. This scholarship helped me continue to do right by my family and graduate in December of this year!”

Two other scholarship recipients echoed their classmate's praises about SPC. Both Carol Gauvey and Emily Plante will graduate in May 2024 and become registered nurses thanks to SPC. Gauvey stated that the scholarship gave her the chance to go part-time. This allowed her to spend more time with family and focus on school as she takes classes at night and on the weekend.

Plante goes to class during the week and has been a part of the Titan family since before even setting foot on a college campus. “SPC has given me a lot of opportunities starting in high school with dual admissions enrollment” Plante said. “The college has been alongside me since the beginning of my journey to my nursing degree and I am very grateful for SPC. This scholarship has continued to help me move forward with my degree.”

SPC’s College of Nursing has prepared nurses to meet the demands of the changing health care industry for the past six decades. The partnership with HCA Florida Healthcare is proof of SPC’s commitment to its students and their future success.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vYmF5bmV3czkuY29tL2ZsL3RhbXBhL25ld3MvMjAyMy8xMi8wMS9oY2EtbnVyc2VzLWNhbGwtZm9yLWhlYWx0aC1zeXN0ZW0tdG8tYWRkcmVzcy1zdGFmZmluZ9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HCA nurses call for health system to address staffing,"TAMPA Fla. — Dozens of nurses from around the country gathered in front of HCA Healthcare’s West Florida Division Office to call on the organization to make changes ahead of contract negotiations next year.

What You Need To Know Dozens of nurses from around the country gathered in front of HCA Healthcare’s West Florida Division Office to call on the organization to make changes ahead of contract negotiations next year



The rally was organized by National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United



The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projected an additional 275000 nurses will be needed nationwide between 2020 and 2030



According to the Florida Hospital Association the Sunshine State could see a shortage of 59000 nurses by 2035

When asked what the group’s top three concerns are Valerie Jean a nurse at HCA Florida Fawcett Hospital in Port Charlotte said “Top three is: unsafe staffing unsafe staffing unsafe staffing.”

Lisa Cornelius a registered nurse at Mountain View Hospital in Las Vegas said she’s sometimes tasked with caring for up to twice as many patients as would normally be standard.

“There’s more work expected from us on a regular basis” Cornelius said. “They increase the charting they increase the acuity of care of the patients and they want them in the same unit the whole entire time.”

The rally was organized by National Nurses Organizing Committee/National Nurses United.

“We go into contract negotiations next year and we want to be on the offensive side to make sure that we show that we’re a united front who’s going to put our patients first” said Hannah Drummond chief nurse representative at her hospital in Asheville N.C.

Staffing shortages are not unique to HCA and are being experienced by hospitals nationwide. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projected an additional 275000 nurses will be needed nationwide between 2020 and 2030. According to the Florida Hospital Association the Sunshine State could see a shortage of 59000 nurses by 2035.

“There’s not really a staffing shortage” said Cornelius. “There’s a shortage of nurses who are willing to work under the conditions the way that they are in the hospitals today.”

“In the ER we’re cleaning our own room. I’m my own phlebotomist I’m my own CNA or patient care tech” said Drummond.

Nurses said that means less time given to individual patients.

“We’re all patients. Management’s patients too. So they need to be aware that if they were in a hospital bed they would want the best care possible. The best care possible is not making us work unsafely short staffed” said Jean.

Debra McKell director of media relations for HCA Healthcare’s West Florida Division said in a statement “Today’s small protest by NNU is no different than their protests against countless health systems across the country. We expect that NNU will continue protesting and making unfounded claims about our hospitals and the quality care that we are proud to provide especially as we enter negotiations for a new contract as we will with this labor union next year. We are proud of the excellent care we provide to our patients which includes earning 338 quality achievements for best in specialty for 2024 from Healthgrades placing our facilities among the top of all short-term acute care hospitals evaluated.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vZGVybmhlYWx0aGNhcmUuY29tL21lcmdlcnMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb25zL2hjYS1oZWFsdGhjYXJlLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLWV4cGFuZHMtZnJlZS1zdGFuZGluZy1lci1uZXR3b3Jr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HCA Healthcare expands free-standing ER network,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.modernhealthcare.com/mergers-acquisitions/hca-healthcare-acquisition-expands-free-standing-er-network on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vZGVybmhlYWx0aGNhcmUuY29tL21lcmdlcnMtYWNxdWlzaXRpb25zL2hjYS1oZWFsdGhjYXJlLWFjcXVpc2l0aW9uLWV4cGFuZHMtZnJlZS1zdGFuZGluZy1lci1uZXR3b3Jr0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS8yMDIzLzEyLzAxL21lZGljYWwtY2l0eS1oZWFsdGhjYXJlLWFjcXVpcmVzLXdpc2UtaGVhbHRoLXN5c3RlbS1pbmNyZWFzaW5nLWQtZnctZm9vdHByaW50L9IBmAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWxsYXNuZXdzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS8yMDIzLzEyLzAxL21lZGljYWwtY2l0eS1oZWFsdGhjYXJlLWFjcXVpcmVzLXdpc2UtaGVhbHRoLXN5c3RlbS1pbmNyZWFzaW5nLWQtZnctZm9vdHByaW50Lz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Medical City Healthcare acquires Wise Health System,"Dallas-based Medical City Healthcare has again expanded in North Texas with the purchase of Wise Health System bringing the health system giant to 19 in-patient hospitals.

Three hospitals will undergo rebranding as part of the acquisition: Medical City Decatur formerly Wise Health East and West Campuses; Medical City Argyle formerly Wise Health Surgical Hospital at Argyle; and Medical City Surgical Hospital Alliance formerly Wise Health Surgical Hospital at Parkway.

Wise Health System formerly known as the Decatur Community Hospital is the largest employer in Wise County with more than 1800 workers according to the not-for-profit hospital system. It serves patients in five counties.

Medical City spokesperson Janet St. James said the health system is not releasing financial information on the deal at this time.

The acquisition marks yet another move in Texas for HCA which operates around 50 care sites in the state. The company is also buying bankrupt Trinity Regional Hospital Sachse for $41 million Bloomberg Law reported.

HCA bet big on the Lone Star State’s rapid growth in 2022 announcing the construction of five new hospitals in Texas’ largest regions including Dallas-Fort Worth.

A combined total of 93 hospitals in Texas and Florida represent a majority of HCA’s admissions and revenue according to the company’s latest financial filings. HCA reported a net income of $4.23 billion for the first nine months of 2023 up from $4.19 billion in the same period last year.

In addition to Medical City’s 19 in-patient hospitals the system boasts nearly 60 urgent care facilities 15 ambulatory surgery centers 3951 licensed beds and 18500 employees.

HCA’s latest purchase aligns with the company’s tendency to pick markets with above-average population growth lower unemployment levels and higher-than-average income growth according to a Bloomberg Intelligence report.

Много акции са изоставени и много от тях носят доходност от 6% или повече - включително общо около 40 в индексите S&P 500 и S&P MidCap 400 според данни от S&P Dow Jones Indices.

Финансовото издание Barron's провери дори за по-висока доходност от 7% в S&P 500 и излезе с половин дузина компании.

Цените на акциите на всичките шест компании от този екран са на червено тази година и те се търгуват за 10 пъти прогнозираните печалби за 2023 г. или по-малко. За Boston Properties и Healthpeak Properties са използвани средства от операции мярка за парични потоци използвана от инвестиционни тръстове за недвижими имоти вместо печалба на акция която е по-ниска и за двете компании.

Altria и Walgreens оглавяват списъка с 95% дивидентна доходност а останалите четири са в диапазона от 7%.

Данни: FactSet

Altria чиито акции се понижиха с около 5% тази година до $41 беше депресирана от опасенията за огромен спад в обемите на цигарите които достигнаха 10% през третото тримесечие в сравнение с исторически годишни спадове в диапазона от 4% до 5%.

След отчета за печалбата за третото тримесечие през август анализаторът на Goldman Sachs Бони Херцог написа че има нарастващи притеснения относно способността на Altria ""да компенсира ускоряващия се спад на обема на цигарите с ценообразуването което води до потенциално по-ограничен ръст на печалбите/EPS"".

Достъпността е проблем тъй като пакет Marlboro струва средно 9 долара в САЩ и демографски данни които са наклонени към клиенти с по-ниски доходи. Херцог остава оптимистичен като твърди че доходността и оценката на Altria са привлекателни.

Altria вижда печалба от около $495 на акция тази година което е с 2% повече спрямо 2022 г.

Малко големи компании са толкова ангажирани с дивидентите си колкото Altria. Тя повишава изплащането годишно в продължение на повече от 50 години включително увеличение от 4% до тримесечна ставка от 98 цента на акция през август. Изплаща около 80% от печалбата си под формата на дивиденти.

Walgreens имаше ужасна година. Акциите му са намалели с почти 50% до $20 което го прави най-лошият компонент на Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Компанията рязко намали насоките за печалбите от началото на годината и консенсусът за фискалната 2024 г. (приключваща през август 2024 г.) сега възлиза на около $335 на акция спад от близо $5 на акция в началото на 2023 г. Тя смени своя главен изпълнителен директор след като беше ударена от спад в продажбите свързани с Covid и е изправена пред съмнения относно успеха на стратегията си за диверсификация в медицински практики.

Анализаторът на JP Morgan Лиза Гил надстрои Walgreens до Overweight от Neutral в края на октомври което я направи един от малкото анализатори на улицата с рейтинг за покупка на акциите. Тя харесва новия главен изпълнителен директор на компанията Тим Уентуърт ветеран в здравеопазването който излезе от пенсия за да оглави веригата аптеки. Тя цитира ""управленски екип фокусиран върху здравеопазването"" и ""понижена но надеждна летва"" за финансовите резултати през текущата фискална година.

Безопасен ли е дивидентът? Гил пише че нейните дискусии ""ни карат да вярваме че инвеститорите като цяло очакват намаление на дивидента"". Walgreens каза на своя конферентен разговор през октомври че ""към този момент"" бордът не е направил промяна в политиката си за дивиденти. Като се имат предвид очакванията за намаление действителното намаление може да няма голямо влияние върху акциите.

Verizon Communications се повиши с 20% от най-ниските си нива през октомври до $37 след като отчетът за печалбите на компанията за третото тримесечие предложи известно успокоение относно конкурентната позиция на компанията в безжичния бизнес. Акциите на Verizon носят около 7% дивидентна доходност.

Докато високата доходност показва известна загриженост на инвеститорите относно устойчивостта на дивидентите компанията увеличи тримесечния дивидент с около пени до 665 цента на акция през лятото 17-ата поредна година на увеличаване на изплащанията.

По време на конферентния разговор за печалбите през юли главният изпълнителен директор Ханс Вестберг каза: ""Нашето покритие на дивиденти е много добро. От началото на годината до момента коефициентът на изплащане на дивидент от свободния паричен поток е приблизително 56% което е значително подобрение спрямо преди година.""

KeyCorp беше ударена заедно с други регионални банкови акции тази година но спечели повече от 25% от дъното си до около $12. Анализаторът на KBW Дейвид Конрад подобри акциите до ""Outperform"" от ""Market Perform"" в началото на ноември цитирайки спад в дългосрочните лихвени проценти и ""по този начин подобрена видимост на капитала"". Той има целева цена от $15.

Конрад отбеляза че KeyCorp има повишен коефициент на изплащане на дивиденти от около 70% и по-нисък капиталов коефициент в сравнение с други регионални банки. Компанията остави тримесечното си изплащане непроменено на 205 цента в декларация за дивидент по-рано през ноември.

Boston Properties е един от водещите офис REITs със сгради на ключови пазари като Ню Йорк Бостън и Сан Франциско.

Акциите му са в депресия поради притеснения относно трудните условия в индустрията. Във връзка с публикуването на печалбите си за третото тримесечие тя по същество запази насоките си за 2023 г. относно средствата от операции.

По време на конферентния си разговор нейният главен изпълнителен директор Оуен Томас каза че ""въпреки силното негативно пазарно настроение BXP имаше още едно продуктивно тримесечие с финансови резултати и лизинг над очакванията и стабилен дивидент."" Акциите при скорошни $54 дават доходност от над 7%.

Healthpeak друг REIT който отдава под наем офис пространство на лекарски практики и лабораторно пространство на биотехнологични и други фармацевтични компании. Компанията има сделка за сливане с Physician Realty Trust.

Във връзка с обявяването на тази сделка по-рано през ноември главният изпълнителен директор на компанията Скот Бринкър каза че планира да запази своя годишен дивидент от $120 което осигурява доходност от около 7% при скорошна цена от $1675.

The threat actors are said to be affiliates of numerous ransomware operations including LockerGoga MegaCortex HIVE and Dharma. This cybercriminal operation is said to have led to the loss of hundreds of millions of euros.

The law enforcement operation occurred on November 21st with coordinated raids in 30 locations in Kyiv Cherkasy Rivne and Vinnytsia. As a result of the operation police arrested the group's alleged ringleader and four of his accomplices.

Of particular interest is that Norway was involved in the operation making cybersecurity researchers believe that this affiliate group may have been behind the Norsk Hydro attack which involved the LockerGoga ransomware.

However a threat actor disputed those rumors on the Russian-speaking XSS hacking forum claiming that the affiliate group had nothing to do with the attack. The threat actor further claims to be the one who gave a police drone the finger in the below video of the law enforcement operation.

In other news ransomware attacks have been surging with further information about attacks being disclosed this week.

This includes attacks on the Ethyrial: Echoes of Yore game developer Ardent Health Services Slovenia's largest power provider HSE and a re-encryption of healthcare giant Henry Schein as punishment for allegedly not paying the ransom.

We also learned that the attack on DP World did not involve encryption. However it could have been a ransomware attack that was stopped before encryptors were deployed.

Finally researchers released some interesting information about ransomware including Cactus ransomware exploiting Qlik Sense flaws to breach networks and Black Basta ransomware believed to have made over $100 million.

November 27th 2023

American healthcare company Henry Schein has reported a second cyberattack this month by the BlackCat/ALPHV ransomware gang who also breached their network in October.

A ransomware attack on the ""Ethyrial: Echoes of Yore"" MMORPG last Friday destroyed 17000 player accounts deleting their in-game items and progress in the game.

Ardent Health Services a healthcare provider operating 30 hospitals across six U.S. states disclosed today that its systems were hit by a ransomware attack on Thursday.

Slovenian power company Holding Slovenske Elektrarne (HSE) has suffered a ransomware attack that compromised its systems and encrypted files yet the company says the incident did not disrupt electric power production.

The LostTrust ransomware family has a fairly small victim pool and has compromised victims earlier this year. The encryptor has similar characteristcs to the MetaEncryptor ransomware family including code flow and strings which indicates that the encryptor is a variant from the original MetaEncryptor source.

PCrisk found a new Chaos variant that appends the .MuskOff extension and drops a ransom note named read_it.txt.

November 28th 2023

In cooperation with Europol and Eurojust law enforcement agencies from seven nations have arrested in Ukraine the core members of a ransomware group linked to attacks against organizations in 71 countries.

The Qilin ransomware group has claimed responsibility for a cyber attack on Yanfeng Automotive Interiors (Yanfeng) one of the world's largest automotive parts suppliers.

International logistics giant DP World has confirmed that data was stolen during a cyber attack that disrupted its operations in Australia earlier this month. However the company says no ransomware payloads or encryption was used in the attack.

November 29th 2023

Russia-linked ransomware gang Black Basta has raked in at least $100 million in ransom payments from more than 90 victims since it first surfaced in April 2022 according to joint research from Corvus Insurance and Elliptic.

PCrisk found new STOP ransomware variants that append the .jawr and .jazi extensions.

PCrisk found a new Phobos variant that appends the .LEAKDB extension and drops a ransom notes named info.txt and info.hta.

November 30th 2023

Cactus ransomware has been exploiting critical vulnerabilities in the Qlik Sense data analytics solution to get initial access on corporate networks.

December 1st 2023

About 60 credit unions are dealing with outages due to a ransomware attack on a widely-used technology provider.

PCrisk found a new MedusaLocker variant that appends the .doctorhelp extension and drops a ransom note named How_to_back_files.html.

PCrisk found a new Darhma variant that appends the .intel extension.

QUOTES

NOTES

The Checkers couldn’t find a way to bounce back in their rematch with the defending champs falling 5-2 to Hershey.Unlike last night’s tilt the Checkers took control out of the gates Saturday night - holding the Bears to just five shots in the first period and snaring the lead thanks to a seeing-eye snipe from Uvis Balinskis in his Charlotte debut.Unfortunately for Charlotte the middle frame proved to be all Hershey. The Bears wasted no time drawing the game back even then tacked on two strikes in quick succession later in the period to hold a two-goal advantage heading into the second intermission.That lopsided period would ultimately be the difference. The Bears pushed their lead even further early on in the third but Lucas Carlsson had a rebuttal shortly after - hammering home a point blast to pull within two and put a spark back in the home team. Hershey netminder Clay Stevenson once again frustrated the Checkers though and an empty-net deposit from Ethen Frank for the hat trick sealed Charlotte’s fate.Yesterday I didn’t like the start and being down especially in the first period. I thought there was some good things after that and it continued on to tonight. A good start a 1-0 start so we corrected that mistake. I’d like to get it to 2-0 when we had some chances and didn’t get it to 2-0. They’re Calder Cup champs for a reason. They have experience over there and they’re opportunistic. I thought they were opportunistic. Move on.I thought they were opportunistic. We made a couple of little mistakes. Two of the goals are on our sticks so we want to make sure we correct that. A lot to like from the game. A good building block. We corrected a mistake from the other night. Again it’s early in the season. We want to become a 60-minute hockey team but there’s a process to getting there and getting guys to be able to feel confident scoring goals. I like the competitiveness to be able to score now once they get the confidence you’ll start to see a little more results with regard to scoring goals.I think there’s a lot of really good things and recipes. We have to score some big-time goals at opportunistic times. Again a 1-0 hockey game you want to make it 2-0. We’re not giving up many chances to be quite honest but we have to be able to get the back-breaking goals to make it 2-0. You look at the Cleveland game 1-1 they come down on a 2-on-1 to score and make it 2-1. We have to get that big-time goal at the right time from some of our players.The Checkers went 1-5-0 over their six-game home stand. Prior to that they were 4-1-0 at home with four straight wins … The Checkers have scored two goals or fewer in seven of their last nine games. During that time they have out-shot the opposition eight times and tied once … Carlsson’s goal was his first since scoring a hat trick on Nov. 10 … Balinskis played his first AHL game … Checkers scratches included forwards Riley Bezeau and Brendan Perlini; defensemen Dennis Cesana Matt Kiersted Evan Nause and Will Reilly; and goaltender Mack Guzda.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnNpZGVyLXNlbGwtcHJlc2lkZW50LXUtY29uZmVjdGlvbi0wODA1MTMxOTUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Insider Sell: President U.S. Confection Charles Raup Sells Shares of The Hershey Co (HSY),"Charles Raup President U.S. Confection at The Hershey Company has recently made a significant stock transaction selling 2065 shares of The Hershey Co (NYSE:HSY) on November 29 2023. This move by a key insider has caught the attention of investors and market analysts prompting a closer look at the implications of such insider activity.

Who is Charles Raup of The Hershey Co?

Charles Raup is a prominent figure within The Hershey Company holding the position of President U.S. Confection. In his role Raup is responsible for overseeing the company's confectionery operations within the United States a segment that is critical to Hershey's overall success. His insights into the company's operations and market position make his trading activities particularly noteworthy to investors seeking to understand insider sentiment.

The Hershey Co's Business Description

The Hershey Company known for its iconic Hershey's chocolate bar is a global leader in chocolate and sugar confectionery. Founded in 1894 by Milton S. Hershey the company has grown into a confectionery powerhouse with a wide range of products including chocolates sweets mints and other snacks.

The company's operations span across various geographies with a significant footprint in North America and expanding interests in international markets.

Analysis of Insider Buy/Sell and the Relationship with the Stock Price

Insider trading activities such as those of Charles Raup can provide valuable insights into a company's internal perspective on its stock's valuation. Over the past year Raup has sold a total of 5089 shares and has not made any purchases. This pattern of selling without corresponding buys could signal that insiders including Raup may believe the stock is fully valued or potentially overvalued at current levels.

However it's important to consider the context of these transactions. Insider sells can occur for various reasons including personal financial planning diversification and other non-company related factors. Therefore while insider selling can be a red flag it should not be the sole basis for investment decisions without a comprehensive analysis of the company's fundamentals and market conditions.

The insider transaction history for The Hershey Co shows a trend of more insider sells than buys over the past year with 44 insider sells and no insider buys. This trend could suggest that insiders are taking advantage of the stock's performance to realize gains.

Story continues

On the day of Raup's recent sell shares of The Hershey Co were trading at $188 giving the company a market cap of $38.429 billion. The price-earnings ratio stood at 20.27 slightly above the industry median of 18.99 but below the company's historical median price-earnings ratio. This indicates that while the stock may be trading at a premium compared to the industry it is still below its historical valuation levels.

When examining the relationship between insider trading activity and stock price it's crucial to consider the company's valuation. With a price of $188 and a GuruFocus Value of $249.91 The Hershey Co has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.75 suggesting that the stock is modestly undervalued based on its GF Value.

The GF Value is an intrinsic value estimate that takes into account historical trading multiples a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth and future business performance estimates from Morningstar analysts. The current price-to-GF-Value ratio indicates that despite the insider selling trend the stock may still offer value to potential investors.

Conclusion

Charles Raup's recent sale of 2065 shares of The Hershey Co is a significant insider move that warrants attention. While the insider selling trend over the past year may raise questions about the stock's valuation the modestly undervalued status based on the GF Value suggests that The Hershey Co could still be an attractive investment opportunity. Investors should weigh insider trading patterns alongside a thorough analysis of the company's fundamentals industry trends and broader market conditions before making investment decisions.

As always it is recommended that investors conduct their own due diligence and consider their investment goals and risk tolerance when evaluating the significance of insider trading activities. The actions of insiders like Charles Raup can provide valuable clues but they are just one piece of the larger investment puzzle.

Frank now leads all Bears’ players in goals with 11 after scoring a team-high 30 as a rookie in 2022-23.

The victory gave the Bears a weekend sweep of Charlotte and extended their winning streak to nine games. The Bears are 18-4-0 to start the season — best in the AHL — and they’re on pace to break another team record (quickest Bears team to 20 wins).

Franks’s 1st goal

Frank’s first goal of the night came at the end of the Bears’ penalty kill. Mike Sgarbossa skated the puck up the right wing on a three-on-two rush before passing across to Frank who was at the left circle. Frank’s slapshot beat Checkers goaltender Ludovic Waeber giving the Bears a 2-1 lead.

Frank scored again 3:49 later. Frank caught up with a moving puck after a pass from Vincent Iorio went just wide. He resettled it and fired the puck under the glove of Waeber. The goal put him in the double digits for scoring this season and gave the Bears a 3-1 lead heading into the third.

Here are the video highlights from tonight from the Charlotte Checkers:

Below is the full game recap from the Hershey Bears:

FRANK TURNS TRICK FOR BEARS IN 5-2 WIN OVER CHECKERS Hershey earns ninth consecutive victory (Charlotte NC – Dec. 2 2023) – Ethen Frank scored three goals for his second career hat trick and Clay Stevenson made an AHL career-high 34 saves to pace the Hershey Bears (18-4-0-0) to a 5-2 win over the Charlotte Checkers (10-9-0-0) on Saturday night at Bojangles’ Coliseum. With the victory Hershey swept its third consecutive week of games extending its season-high win streak to nine games and pushed its road win streak to six games. BOX SCORE Uvis Balinskis opened the scoring for the hosts at 6:12 of the first period with a shot from the slot that beat Stevenson to the glove side to give Charlotte a 1-0 lead which the Checkers would preserve heading into the intermission. Aaron Ness took a cross-slot feed from Joe Snively and fired a shot past Ludovic Waeber at 4:41 of the second period to draw Hershey level with his first goal of the campaign. Alex Limoges earned a secondary assist on the goal. After Hardy Häman Aktell skipped the puck along the right-wing boards to Mike Sgarbossa the center broke into the offensive zone and flipped a pass across to the left circle where Frank one-timed his ninth of the season past Waeber at 11:15 to give the Bears a 2-1 lead. Minutes later Frank received a long pass from Vincent Iorio to center ice before flying up the right side and sneaking a shot into the upper-right corner of the Charlotte net to give Hershey a 3-1 edge at 15:04. The Bears extended their lead in the third period as Joe Snively grabbed the puck along the ice in front of the net and potted his seventh of the season at 4:38 from Jimmy Huntington and Limoges. Lucas Carlsson’s shot from the blue line beat a screened Stevenson and pulled the Checkers back to within a pair of goals at 6:41 cutting Hershey’s lead to 4-2. Frank completed his three-goal night with an empty-net power-play tally from Logan Day and Mike Vecchione at 17:57 to seal the game for Hershey. Shots finished 36-21 in favor of the Checkers. Stevenson went 34-for-36 to secure his fourth consecutive victory of the season and his eighth win of the season overall (first among AHL rookies); Waeber stopped 16-of-20 shots in the defeat for Charlotte. Hershey went 1-for-3 on the power play; the Checkers went 0-for-3 with the man advantage.

The pace of discovery in the Stabroek Block has been astounding. There have been 32 major discoveries to date. There are currently 3 projects in production: Liza Phase 1 Liza Phase 2 and Payara. The current daily output is 620000 barrels of oil. There are 2 additional projects approved for production: Yellowtail and Uaru. Plus a third in the approval process named Whiptail. With these 6 projects there is an aim to produce 1.2 million barrels of oil a day by 2027. The six projects that are either producing or will be producing soon have an estimated capital cost of US$55 billion. The government has commissioned 2 audits thus far: the 1999 to 2017 audit which was estimated to cover US$1.7 billion in claimed expenses and the 2018 to 2020 audit that covered US$7.3 billion in claimed expenses. However given that there is a 2-year time-window to audit [Article 23 and Section 1.5 (a) in Annex C of the PSA 2016] it is not clear what is the schedule to audit the remaining at least US$46 billion in expenses (US$55B – US$1.7B – US$7.3B).

To put US$55 billion in perspective before oil production started at the end of 2019 Guyana’s annual national budget was US$2 billion/year. Thus US$55 billion in expenses is more than what Guyana would have spent in the last 27 years combined. Given the astronomical sums involved and the controversies surrounding the 1999 to 2017 audit see here https://www.oggn.org/2023/09/20/gra-is-not-the-competent-authority-to-lead-all-or-any-petroleum-audits/ and the 2018 to 2020 audit see here https://www.oggn.org/2023/11/25/these-findings-justify-a-full-scale-forensic-audit-of-the-2018-2020-accounts-of-exxonmobil-guyana/ one would hope the government could be more transparent with these audits for the public’s benefit. However both the 1999 to 2017 audit which was completed in 2021 and the most recent audit have not been made public by the government. This would naturally raise the question – ‘is the government protecting the oil companies for overbilling Guyana’?

Now let’s look at how the US$55 billion in capital cost is broken down across the 6 projects that are either producing or will soon be in production. The table (below) shows some of the details of these projects. There is a break-even cost per project as stated by one of the Stabroek Block partners i.e. HESS Corporation [in September 2023 before it announced the sale of its interests to Chevron]. One would assume the break-even cost per project would be closely correlated with the capital cost given that it seems from various reports the operational costs may be US$10/barrel. However Uaru which has the same break-even cost as Liza Phase 1 is 37% more expensive in capital cost. Payara is more than double the capital cost per barrel for Liza Phase 1 although the breakeven cost differences between the projects are not that much.

Given the economies of scale and the lessons learnt along the way one would expect that for newer projects the capital cost per barrel would trend downwards. For example all but one of the six floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels were commissioned from the same company SBM Offshore and four are identical in size capacity and design. Hence do the existing audit reports explain this anomaly or will the future US$46 billion plus to be audited tease out what may be going on here? But the Government of Guyana does not have unlimited time to do audits they have to be undertaken within 2 years of the expenses being booked. In Annex ‘C’ Section 1.5 (C) it says “Without prejudice to the finality of matters as described in sub-sections 1.5 (a) and 1.5 (b) all documents referred to in those sub-sections shall be maintained and made available for inspection by the Minister for two (2) years following their date of issue providing however that where issues are outstanding with respect to an audit the Contractor shall maintain documents for a longer period until the issues are resolved.”

In 2018 Dr. Jan Mangal and others using the media raised concerns about the US$4.4 billion in capital cost for Liza Phase 1. As a result that figure was slashed by US$700 million see here https://www.stabroeknews.com/2018/12/16/news/guyana/projected-cost-for-exxons-liza-phase-1-slashed-by-us700m/. After all the revisions Liza Phase 1 went down from US$4.4 billion in capital cost to US$3.5 billion. Thus Liza Phase 1 was inflated by 25%. No reduction has happened with subsequent oil field development projects. One has to wonder given the anomalies in the above table whether a forensic audit of the US$55 billion in capital cost might not uncover significantly inflated numbers. The government should request that Exxon provide more information to explain the discrepancies between the capital cost and break-even cost across the 6 projects. Finally the Government of Guyana needs to demand more oversight in the process leading to the commissioning of new FPSOs.

The explosive suit also outlined a toxic company culture in which management forced employees to fare for themselves and ignore safety rules including multiple 24-hour shifts.

The events are said to have occurred between 2020 and 2022 when Blue Origin was racing to fulfill US government contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars.

Blue Origin's BE-4 explosion this past June was so catastrophic according to leakers who reviewed a video of the accident that it also severely damaged the test stand infrastructure at the company's West Texas facility. Above an earlier more successful BE-4 test firing in Texas

Plaintiff Craig Stoker brought the lawsuit which also alleged wrongful termination that stemmed from his complaints about safety issues.

Stoker managed the Blue Origin BE-4 rocket engine project for two years ending in October 2022 when he was fired without cause.

The BE-4 has been plagued by delays for years.

According to the lawsuit Stoker and others were ordered to withhold information about production and delivery delays from United Launch Alliance whose Vulcan launch vehicle the BE-4 is supposed to fly on.

Stoker's lawsuit alleged that Blue Origin retaliated against him for blowing the whistle on safety issues and the company culture that created them.

He alleged in the lawsuit that then-CEO Robert Smith pushed the team 'to frequently violate safety procedures and processes in order to meet unreasonable deadlines.'

'Then when issues inevitably arose (including those related to safety) Smith would explode' according to the plaintiff Craig Stoker.

One of the $7 million BE-4s exploded in a fireball during a routine test in June of this year adding to the 'frustrating delays' in the engine's development.

'There seems to be a cultural problem there' Stoker's attorney Will Reed told DailyMail.com.

The allegations paint a picture of a company that prized deadlines over employee safety and Stoker was canned for trying to speak up to protect his fellow employees - violating California laws protecting whistleblowers who raise concerns.

Blue Origin did not respond to a request for comment.

Jeff Bezos' rocket company Blue Origin received $500 million from the US Air Force to develop launch systems for national defense missions but delays with the BE-4 rocket engine had been experiencing 'frustrating delays'

Not only were Stoker's complaints swept under the rug the lawsuit alleged but women in leadership also dismissed his concerns and expected him to grin and bear it by his because he was a man the suit claims.

It was filed by the law firm of Shegerian and Associates in the Superior Court of California for Los Angeles County's central district on November 27.

In one of the more shocking allegations Stoker said that one of his fellow Blue Origin employees almost asphyxiated while working beneath an engine nozzle during a nitrogen purge in the summer of 2022.

This process uses nitrogen to clear any residual fuel oxygen or moisture from a rocket engine's fuel lines. Nitrogen gas is nonflammable but it can suffocate people if enough of it fills an enclosed space.

'Despite the fact that industry practice required barriers and notification systems in the areas subject to nitrogen purges to make employees aware of the imminent danger neither of those systems were in place at the time' the lawsuit alleged.

This incident happened not long after Stoker had raised his first concerns with company leadership.

According to the lawsuit Stoker made his initial complaint about safety concerns in a meeting with Linda Covy vice president of the engines business unit and Mary Plunkett senior vice president of human resources in May 2022.

Later that month Stoker emailed Cova and Plunkett 'to reiterate and report other serious concerns related to the behavior of CEO Smith and the ever present hostile work environment that was hampering Blue Origin’s ability to operate safely efficiently or competently' according to the lawsuit.

In the email Stoker complained that rather than moving more quickly due to Smith's urgings he and his leadership team wasted time and energy cleaning up after the CEO.

'We spend significant time smoothing things over building back morale repairing damage stopping people from overreacting to direction to violate policies and procedures and guiding them in making the right decisions' the lawsuit reads.

In early 2023 he also reported that on at least two occasions teams were required to work 24-hour shifts.

The resulting exhaustion and burnout led to mistakes that required additional time and energy to correct he alleged.

Melissa Beatty senior director of human resources at Blue Origin was assigned to lead the investigation into stoker's complaints according to the lawsuit and she met with Stoker in May and June of 2022 to go over his complaints. Since they involved the CEO they were handed over to outside counsel Stoker was reportedly told.

In the time after he made his complaints the company retaliated against him Stoker alleged.

They 'actively sought to embarrass Stoker in front of his peers' by denying him a permanent work station in the company's Los Angeles office he claimed.

Stoker kept complaining about safety problems and the dismissive culture around them until in October 2022 he was told that he was being terminated 'without cause' according to the lawsuit.

Regardless of the company's stated reasoning Stoker's termination had the appearance of retaliation Reed told DailyMail.com.

He received good performance reviews but after he started complaining about the company he was fired without cause.

When he got canned Stoker was informed he had done nothing wrong nor was he being accused of any misconduct. He later received a severance offer that he characterized in the lawsuit as 'crappy.'

'You shouldn't throw away good employees - who try to protect other employees - like trash' said Reed.

This lawsuit isn't the first the world heard of management and leadership issues at Blue Origin.

In October 2021 reports surfaced that the company suffered from a toxic dysfunctional 'bro culture.'

But whereas at that time female employees alleged a toxic environment for women Stoker's suit said it was toxic for men too.

In September of this year Smith stepped down as CEO.

Stoker demanded that Blue Origin pay damages for the total of 12 separate claims the lawsuit contains and he demanded a trial by jury.

Reed did not disclose how much his client was seeking in the lawsuit.

Operator: Pardon me this is the conference operator. The speaker's line has appears to have dropped. Please remain on the line while we rejoin them. Thank you.

Antonio Neri: Eddie can you hear us?

Operator: Yes sir we can hear you now. Thank you.

Antonio Neri: All right thank you. Well thanks Jeff and good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. In fiscal year 2023 HPE delivered record performance against non-GAAP financial metrics by capitalizing on strong momentum across our portfolio. Our steady execution has resulted in higher revenue further gross margin expansion larger operating profit and record-breaking non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. Our growth engines in Intelligent Edge and HPC and AI as well as our HPE GreenLake platform are helping to accelerate our revenue and profit diversification. Importantly HPE has achieved demonstrable success this year in our ongoing portfolio pivot to higher growth higher margin areas aligned to the key market megatrends driving customer demand.

I will focus my commentary today on our full-year fiscal year 2023 results and allow Jeremy to expand on the fourth quarter and segment results. I'm very proud of all that HPE delivered in fiscal year 2023 for our shareholders our customers and our team members. Our performance demonstrates the relevance of our strategy our portfolio differentiation and our strong execution. We delivered extraordinary innovation to customers resulting in share gains in key markets and profitable growth for our company. HPE generated our highest gross margin and highest operating profits since I became CEO and our highest annual revenue in four years. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow were the largest ever in our company's history.

We saw healthy sustained growth in revenue at $29.1 billion for the full-year an increase of 5.5% year-over-year in constant currency a third straight year of revenue [Technical Difficulty] point of our full fiscal year 2023 guidance of 5%. Gross margins exceeded 35%. We also added substantially to our annualized revenue run rate closing fiscal year 2023 with more than $1.3 billion in ARR. That represents a nearly $370 million increase from this time last year. Non-GAAP operating profit margin was up 20 basis points year-over-year to end the year at 10.8%. We have executed well on our addressable market opportunities and exercised prudence with our expenses and obligations. Non-GAAP EPS increased 6.4% year-over-year to $2.15. Improved profitability also means that we have significantly boosted free cash flows which rose by about $400 million this year to $2.2 billion and nearly 25% year-over-year increase.

Both non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow results are record-breaking and well above our fiscal year 2022 sum guidance. In summary HPE delivered an impressive set of results in fiscal year 2023. With the progress we have made this year and are confidence in generating further value for our shareholders we are raising our dividends in 2024. HPE is more relevant than ever to our customers. We have deliberately aligned our strategy over the last few years to significant trends in the market around edge hybrid cloud and AI. These growth engines align to our customers' interests and where they are targeting their IT spend. Even against an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop we saw continued though uneven demand across our HPE portfolio with a significant acceleration in AI orders.

Demand in our AI solutions is exploding. We saw a significant uptick in customer demand in recent quarters for accelerated computing infrastructure and services. In Q4 orders for servers that include accelerated processing units or APUs represented 32% of our total server order mix up more than 250% from the beginning of fiscal year 2023. APUs which includes GPU-based servers orders across our business represented 25% of our total server order mix in fiscal year 2023. Our HPC & AI segment revenue grew 25% year-over-year in fiscal year 2023. We ended this fiscal year with the largest HPC & AI order book on record driven by $3.6 billion in company-wide APU orders. This tops what has been an historically large order book in the third quarter as demand accelerated for our supercomputing and AI solutions.

We anticipate demand next fiscal year will remain very strong. We likely have a large order backlog and the GPU supply is less constrained. Two weeks ago at the Supercomputing Conference we expanded our collaboration with NVIDIA to announce a turnkey pre-configured supercomputing solution for generative AI to streamline the model development process. The new solution speeds up the training and fine-tuning of AI models using [Indiscernible] data sets. Designed for large enterprises research institutions and government organizations it comprises HPE AI software our industry-leading supercomputing and storage solutions. Our HPE Slingshot Interconnect Fabric and HPE services and the Quad NVIDIA Grace Hopper GH200 Superchip. Later this week at HPE Discover Barcelona we will further expand our NVIDIA partnership with new solutions created for enterprise customers.

Also this month the University of Bristol announced that HPE has been selected to deliver the U.K.'s fastest supercomputer thanks to our U.K. government investment of GPB225 million intended to make the nation a world leader in AI. The Japan National Institute of Information and Communications Technology recently turned to HPE Cray XD supercomputers to develop an AI-based multilingual communication tool to process translate and interpret text and images for 17 languages. And we just announced a partnership with Dark Bite a provider of next-generation high-performance computing green data centers to power its AI cloud service with HPE Cray supercomputers and our purpose-built machine learning software suite. With HPE built supercomputers consistently ranked among monthly top 10 within the top 500 most powerful and sustainable supercomputers our clear leadership in this space continues to position us well in the AI market.

Our Intelligent Edge segment was the largest driver of our revenue and profit growth in fiscal year 2023 making up 18% of our overall revenue and 39% of the segment operating profit. Fiscal year 2023 revenue in this segment increased by 45% to $5.2 billion while operating margins expanded more than 1200 basis points year-over-year to 27.3% demonstrating the relevance of our offering and the payoff of investments over time. A critical part of our intelligent edge portfolio in the edge supply portfolio is to continue -- will continue to contribute meaningfully to profitable growth for our shareholders. The compute segment is going through a cyclical period where customers are consuming prior investments making this a price-competitive market for now.

As we prepare to capture a greater share of AI linked inferencing opportunities we saw overall demand improved moderately in the second-half and are encouraged in our outlook for this segment. Customer interest in service with ATUs is growing. We are investing in specialized sales resources that can enhance future growth. We also know we must keep our focus on capturing heavy unit in this business while keeping balancing our operating margin performance. The overall storage market has been sluggish this year. And on our -- even our uneven performance in this segment is in line with most of our peers. However we are encouraged with three quarters of stable demand. We saw sequential improvement in storage revenue in the fourth quarter. We continue to invest in our sales execution capabilities.

We recently deployed a large specialized store sales force including a team devoted to growing our storage IP product mix. We expect our subscription-based offerings and differentiated IP problems like HP Electra will continue to be sources of strong growth to enhance the profitability of this business in the year ahead. We remain focused on advancing our position in Hybrid Cloud. We ended the year with 29000 customers on our HPE GreenLake cloud platform. Customers require a hybrid by design IT estate. They are attracted to our cloud platform because of its experience flexibility and cost. In the fourth quarter we closed our largest HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise deal to-date. In addition we saw more customer demand around our HPE GreenLake SaaS offerings across data protection observability and sustainability services.

Finally our HPE Financial Services segment continues to deliver strategic sustainable solutions for customers accelerating our strategy and helping to expand earnings for our shareholders. Financing volumes rose year-over-year with a major contribution from efforts to boost our other service volumes through HP GreenLake. Fiscal year 2023 was an important year for HP one we advanced our strategy and delivered record financial performance for our shareholders through focused execution and operating discipline. I'm confident in our ability to continue to deliver for our shareholders in fiscal year 2024 and beyond for three main reasons. First the work we have done over the last several years to innovate and invest in the right places places where we have the expertise and the ability to scale has given us a portfolio that I believe stands apart from any other.

Second we have weathered cyclical dynamics well. While others have had much more severe shift to make we have been able to stay the course in bringing our strategy to life because we have made operational improvements and have managed expenses in a disciplined way. And finally we have been bold in undertaking transformation across the company. The changes we have made to our operating model to strengthen capabilities in our growth segment focus on our road maps across the portfolio create new customer experience and reach them in new ways will each pay off next year and beyond. We are set up very well to navigate the current climate with and for our customers and to add significantly to the long-term profitability and value we create for our shareholders.

While headwinds remain in certain segments of the IT market HPE is positioned very well to continue our momentum and we are lesser focused in areas where we know we can do more to improve our performance. I hope you share my optimism in what HP can achieve in the year ahead. Let me now invite Jeremy to discuss the fourth quarter and specific same year results. So Jeremy over to you.

Jeremy Cox: Thank you very much Antonio. We closed FY '23 with another solid performance. Our Q4 results reflect our strategic focus to diversify our business towards higher growth higher margin areas of the market. The company's transformation we have undertaken several years ago to pivot to edge and cloud is paying off. And with AI exploding in 2023 we see several promising indicators as we look further in 2024 and despite some unevenness in some areas of the IT market where we participate. Q4 performance was highlighted by healthy revenues and gross margins. Revenue grew 5% sequentially in constant currency to $7.4 billion. hitting the midpoint of our Q4 revenue guidance range. Year-over-year revenue however was down 6% on a difficult compare to Q4 '22 during which significant order book consumption boosted our results.

Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was 34.8% which was up 170 basis points year-over-year largely due to the increasing contribution of our Intelligent Edge segment. Let me remind you of the deliberate targeted investment decisions we made in Q4 that I flagged to SAM which were funded with the better-than-expected OIE performance in the same period. The impact of this investment along with the strong seasonal growth in HPC and AI resulted in a Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 9.7%. This is down 60 basis points sequentially and 180 basis points year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating margins to quickly be over in Q1 '24. This led to GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.49 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.52 which was at the high end of our Q4 guidance range of $0.48 to $0.52.

Our Q4 free cash flow of $2.3 billion was record-breaking for the company. HPE also delivered an impressive full year performance in FY '23. We delivered revenue growth of 5.5% in constant currency which was at the upper end of our guidance range of 4% to 6%. Currency was a 330 basis point headwind for the year. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $2.15 and was also at the high end of our prior guidance and well above our initial guidance from SAM 2022 $1.96 to $2.04. FY '23 free cash flow of $2.2 billion was well above our guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Let's now turn to our segment results. As a reminder all revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency and I will discuss the segments in our prior structure. The company is now operating according to our new structure.

And as communicated at SAM we plan to file restated historical financials for the new segments well before we report our Q1 '24 results. In Intelligent Edge we grew revenue 40% year-over-year in Q4. Demand in our core product was down sequentially on customer digestion but grew in our software-centric solutions such as our HP Aruba Central cloud management software and in our new TAM opportunities such as our SASE security software suite. Our operating margin of 29.5% was up more than 1600 basis points year-over-year. While very pleased with this performance we continue to expect a mid-20% operating margin over time as communicated at SAM 2023. And finally we're making progress on our order book and expect to be back close to historical normal levels by midyear 2024.

In HPC & AI Q4 revenue grew 38% year-over-year and 41% sequentially. Q4 revenue results included only a modest amount of AI revenue. On a sequential basis the continued strength in AI demand lifted our order book in the HPC & AI segment to more than $3 billion despite our significant revenue growth in the quarter. We continue to expect double-digit revenue growth in the segment over the next three years and we are increasingly confident we will be above trend in FY '24 with GPU supply or gating factor. Our Q4 operating margin was 4.7% up 120 basis points year-over-year and 550 basis points sequentially. While we have much more progress to make this does illustrate the positive benefits of scale. The early stage of the AI market tightness in certain key accelerators and long lead times in this segment means that the HPC & AI margins will fluctuate.

Storage revenues fell 12% year-over-year on a difficult compare but rose 3% sequentially. Storage demand has now been flat to up for three straight quarters. HPE Electra revenue grew over 50% year-over-year and it will remain a robust growth contributor in FY '24 supported by growth in file and object storage. HPE Electra is shifting our mix within storage to higher-margin software subscription revenue which is a key driver of our ARR growth. Q4 storage operating margin of 8.1% was down 730 basis points year-over-year. Headwinds included the deferred revenue impact of the HP Electro subscription software accelerated investment outpacing year-over-year revenue performance and a high mix of third-party products this quarter. Our investments in product portfolio give us confidence storage will make progress through FY '24 toward our long-term operating profit margin target communicated at SAM 2023 of mid-teens.

Compute revenue was down 30% year-over-year on a difficult compare and down 1% sequentially. De elongation and customer digestion we discussed previously continued to be most prevalent in compute. Declining AUPs from a record high in Q1 '23 was also a meaningful driver. However two straight quarters of sequential improvement in demand lends further confidence to our FY '24 outlook. Our full-year operating margin of 13.7% exceeded our target range of 11% to 13% but the operating margin of 9.8% in Q4 was temporarily below the range. Given gross margins remain largely flat sequentially and the sequential demand increases we continue to expect operating margins to be in the target range for FY '24. HPE Financial Services revenues were flat year-over-year and financing volume was $1.5 billion.

Our operating margin of 8.9% was down 220 basis points year-over-year reflecting rapid intra sites that we are offsetting through pricing as well as asset management margins returning to normal as supply challenges ease. Our Q4 loss ratio remained steady at 0.5%. Let's double-click on our portfolio pivot to higher growth higher margin recurring revenue and in particular to Intelligent Edge. Even three years ago the Intelligent Edge segment constituted just 10% of segment revenue. This year it represented 18%. The operating profit trajectory is even more telling. The Intelligent Edge segment contributed approximately 14% of the segment's operating profit three years ago and was nearly 40% in FY '23. In FY '24 we intend to give you a similar view combining our growth pillars of HPC and AI hybrid cloud and intelligent edge segments.

Within that we expect the Intelligent Edge segment growth to moderate in the HPC & AI segment growth to accelerate. Robust demand in our hybrid cloud and as-a-service offerings illustrates the durability of our portfolio shift. ARR exceeded $1.3 billion in Q4. This represented 37% year-over-year growth which is in line with our long-term CAGR target of 35% to 45%. Storage and Intelligent Edge software and services are the fastest-growing components of ARR. We continue to lift HPE GreenLake's value proposition with an increasing mix of higher-margin recurring software and services revenue. Our software and services mix was 68% in the quarter. We expect this mix to increase into the upper 70% range by FY '26. This expansion is driven by the growth of subscription-based software with our products and the increased attach of our HPE operational services which rose double-digits in Q4.

The rising software and services mix is expanding our as-a-service margins. Our as-a-service orders grew 11% year-over-year in Q4 and finished the year up a solid 23% after 68% growth in FY '22. Our cumulative as-a-service TCV has now increased to nearly $13 billion. As ARR is now on a clear path to meaningful scale we will simplify our as-a-service disclosure from ARR as-a-service orders in TCV to only ARR in FY ‘24. The explosion in AI demand is driving robust growth in our APU orders. Total APU orders which include APUs in our compute Cray EX and Cray XD businesses totaled $3.6 billion in FY '23 which is up from the over $3 billion we disclosed at SAM 2023. HPE Cray XD APU orders accelerated in Q3 and in Q4 reaching $2.4 billion for the year.

The impressive APU server demand is also evident in our total server demand. APUs represented 25% of total server order dollars in FY '23 up from 10% in the prior year. We will continue to disclose APU orders. However orders can be easily north of $100 million each therefore orders may be lumpy. But the key point is that we are capturing AI demand now and are well positioned for coming demand across the entire AI life cycle from training to tuning to inferencing. Our strategy is delivering top line growth and gross margin expansion. Despite the challenging macro ongoing product digestion and currency headwinds we still produced one of our highest quarterly revenue figures since 2018 while sustaining our expanded gross margin profile. Our Q4 non-GAAP gross margin rose 170 basis points year-over-year to 34.8%.

And our full year non-GAAP gross margin rose 140 basis points to 35.3%. That's a more than 500 basis point improvement from FY '18. Moving to free cash flow. In Q4 we generated $2.8 billion in cash flow from operations and $2.3 billion in free cash flow. Our $2.2 billion in free cash flow in FY '23 was above the high end of our guidance and up meaningfully from $1.8 billion in FY '22 primarily on improved earnings and net income conversion. We exited FY '23 with a cash conversion cycle of negative four days which exceeded our expectation for neutral we communicated at SAM. Strong working capital management in Q4 and reduced transformation costs in FY '23 drove an improvement in our conversion of non-GAAP net earnings to free cash flow to approximately 80% in FY '23.

Continued progress in FY ‘24 and beyond leads us to expect to reach 90% by FY '26. We reiterate our FY ‘24 free cash flow guidance from SAM of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. And we returned over $1 billion in capital to shareholders in FY ‘23 including $421 million in share repurchases. While certain price and volume parameters of our trading program limited us to below our $500 million target in FY ‘23 we reiterate our goal of returning 65% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders between FY '24 and FY '26. Before we dive into our outlook let me remind you that we will exclude H3C earnings and gain on sale from our non-GAAP results in FY '24 as we noted at SAM. We continue to expect the process to conclude and the receipt of the cash proceeds in the first-half of calendar 2024.

For Q1 we expect revenues in the range of $6.9 billion to $7.3 billion. This incorporates historical seasonality in our overall business including in the HPC & AI segment after its strong Q4. We expect AI revenue acceleration to drive sequential growth in HPC & AI and total HPE revenue in Q2 '24. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.24 and $0.32 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.42 and $0.50. We're reiterating our prior year 2024 guidance of 2% to 4% revenue growth in constant currency. We expect OI&E which as noted excludes HCC going forward to be a headwind of approximately $300 million and our non-GAAP structural tax rate to be 15%. Our full-year GAAP diluted net EPS guidance of $1.81 to $2.01 is $0.02 lower than our prior view as a bit of transformation costs slipped into FY '24.

We are reiterating our full-year non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance of $1.82 to $2.02. We also reiterate free cash flow guidance of between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. We continue to believe our FY '24 performance will be weighted to the second-half of the year as GPU supply improves. We are increasing our dividend by 8% in FY '24 and intend to return 65% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders this year. So to conclude while there continues to be unevenness in some areas of the IT market our investment in growing areas of our portfolio is paying off. We are confident in our ability to continue to capture the AI explosion in demand. AI also opens broader customer discussions about the benefits of AI inferencing at the edge and the need to be hybrid by design.

Our HPE GreenLake Cloud platform our AI native portfolio and our services expertise are perfectly aligned to the needs of our customers that we believe will turn into profitable growth for our shareholders. Now let's open it up for questions.

Each Dec. 4 the humble beloved sweet treat—the cookie—is celebrated for National Cookie Day. And with the holiday season in full swing families are already crafting up delicious seasonal delights—like jelly-filled hertzoggie in South Africa or cinnamon-flavored speculaas in the Netherlands—to leave out for Santa Claus Papa Noel Christkind Sinterklaas and other legendary holiday gift-givers.

Try German Lebkuchen

Gingerbread lovers will delight in traditional German lebkuchen a honey-sweetened cookie that’s a storied part of Germany's Christmas traditions. The history of lebkuchen dates to German monks in the 13th century and has steadily remained a popular snack for the holiday season. Kinder (children) in Southern Germany leave lebkuchen for Christkind the figure they associate with gift-giving during the Christmas season. Christkind is a young angelic figure dressed in a white robe with a radiant appearance who is known to make a gentle knock on the door or ring a bell on Christmas Eve.

Travelers seeking a different type of world-famous cookie during their visit to the bustling German city of Frankfurt should check into DoubleTree by Hilton Frankfurt Niederrad where the region’s many museums walking trails shopping and other attractions are all within easy reach.

Sample South African Hertzoggie

Hertzoggie jelly-filled cookies with a light coconut meringue topping are one of the most popular confections in South Africa. Here children supply their Santa Claus who is often referred to as ""Father Christmas” with hertzoggie to help power this red-suited jolly bearded gift giver with the energy needed to deliver presents throughout the night. The cookies are also enjoyed during South African Christmas gatherings which often include outdoor braais (barbecues) and the singing of carols.

Visitors to the dynamic port city of Cape Town can enjoy a cocktail with their cookies at the estreet bar at DoubleTree by Hilton Cape Town - Upper Eastside. Located near the base of Table Mountain with views of Devil's Peak the hotel is a short walk from local attractions and offers a free shuttle to the waterfront.

Delight in Dutch Speculaas

Speculaas uniquely cinnamon-spiced biscuits that originated in the Netherlands make for a delightful treat to enjoy with coffee. Made with intricate imprints or designs Dutch speculaas are traditionally associated with the celebration of Sinterklaas based on the historical figure of Saint Nicholas during his feast day on Dec. 6. Sinterklaas is an elderly man with a long white beard who wears a red bishop's robe who is believed to leave gifts in shoes or stockings along with poems often written in a humorous or teasing style.

To sample speculaas visit charming Amsterdam and explore the city on foot by bike or by tram during a stay at DoubleTree by Hilton Amsterdam Centraal Station. Here hungry adventure seekers can snack on sweet treats while enjoying canal views through floor-to-ceiling windows and city panoramas at the Rooftop Bar LuminAir.

Feast on Peruvian Alfajores

In Peru alfajores are popular confections made from two delicate and crumbly cookies sandwiched together with a rich and creamy dulce de leche caramel filling. These delicious delights are generally relatively small making them a perfect bite-sized holiday treat to leave out for Papa Noel which translates into “Santa Claus” in Spanish. Local bakeries often dust alfajores with a coating of snow-white powdered sugar giving these treats a wintery look that’s perfect for seasonal snacking during a South American holiday getaway.

For a warm-weather oceanside retreat consider booking a room at the waterfront DoubleTree Resort by Hilton Hotel Paracas - Peru which faces Paracas Bay and is located five minutes from the town center. Located next to the Paracas National Reserve the hotel boasts a scenic pool that makes for the perfect spot to enjoy a sweet treat.

Snack on Scottish Shortbread

Scottish shortbread is an iconic Scottish dessert that has been enjoyed for centuries. Known for its rich buttery and crumbly texture as well as its simple yet indulgent flavor this classic treat is particularly popular during the holiday season and is an integral part of Scottish culinary traditions. Scottish children leave out these snacks for Father Christmas who like in many parts of the world travels in a sleigh pulled by reindeer to deliver presents each Christmas Eve.

Visitors can shop for shortbread along Edinburgh’s famed Royal Mile which is easily accessed from the historic DoubleTree by Hilton Edinburgh City Centre built in 1892. Guests can grab a complimentary cookie before heading out to explore nearby Edinburgh Castle Princess Street shopping the Grassmarket and Edinburgh Old Town.

Kuri kinton is a traditional Japanese confection that’s enjoyed during the New Year's holiday season. Made from sweet chestnuts and sugar the name ""kuri kinton"" roughly translates to ""chestnut gold mash"" due to its shiny appearance which many believe resembles a pile of gold. People eat kuri kinton on New Year’s believing it may increase financial luck wealth and fortune.

After snacking on kuri kinton savor a warm cookie upon check-in at DoubleTree by Hilton Kyoto Higashiyama. A celebration of Kyoto culture the hotel is located just across the Gojo Ohashi Bridge near Kyoto Station and UNESCO World Heritage sites.

Enjoy Austrian Linzer Cookies

Linzer cookies are a popular and classic Austrian dessert made from a buttery and crumbly almond-based dough that’s filled with raspberry or blackcurrant jam. Charming in appearance these cookies have a small decorative cutout in the center that allows the jam to peek through and create a colorful contrast. But while good girls and boys may leave cookies out for Saint Nicholas naughty kinder may find themselves visited by the menacing Krampus a horned anthropomorphic figure with hooves fur and a long pointed tongue who makes his appearance on Krampusnacht celebrated on Dec. 5.

To savor the best of Austria stay near Vienna’s stunning Schönbrunn Palace which is just a five-minute walk from DoubleTree by Hilton Vienna Schonbrunn. Here travelers of all ages are rewarded with warm cookies after a day full of exploration through the sparkling “City of Music.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvc3BpdGFsaXR5bmV0Lm9yZy9uZXdzLzQxMTkzODIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Curio Collection by Hilton Marks 150-Hotel Achievement: A Year of Remarkable Worldwide Growth,"Curio Collection by Hilton a global portfolio of handpicked hotels that immerse guests in one-of-a-kind moments in the world’s most sought-after destinations is recognizing a robust year of openings that have paved the way for the brand to reach its 150th opening milestone by the end of 2023.

Ananti Inc. will end its six-year-long partnership with Hilton Hotels & Resorts by removing the global hotel giant's nameplate from its luxury seaside hotel in Busan. It will independently operate it starting next year.The South Korean hospitality company that operates multiple hotels resorts and golf courses across the country announced on Thursday that it will rebrand Ananti Hilton Busan as Ananti At Busan Cove.The new name will be applied starting January 2024.The split comes six years after the hotel opened in 2017 as Hilton Busan in the country’s second-largest city under a partnership contract between Ananti and Hilton Hotels & Resorts.The alliance allowed the flagship upscale hotel brand of global hospitality giant Hilton to fully manage the hotel in Busan with its own operation system and managers.However the Korean hotel and resort company has gradually lessened its reliance on the global hospitality juggernaut in recent years after gaining confidence in the management and operation of hotels and resorts under its own marquee 'Ananti At' in other parts of Korea.In 2022 the hotel changed its name to Ananti Hilton Busan after taking over the hotel management rights and since then has only been sharing Hilton’s brand and global booking system.By dropping Hilton from its name Ananti will sever its ties with Hilton in the hotel business meaning it will stop using Hilton’s global booking system and member loyalty program starting next year.Even without the Hilton brand and operation system Ananti expects its hotel in Busan to thrive under its independent booking and membership systems which have already been rolled out to Ananti At Gangnam which opened in Seoul in June 2022.Ananti has succeeded in attracting overseas travelers to the hotel in Seoul without Hilton’s booking system. Foreign guests accounted for nearly half of all guests this year the company said.To lure even more guests from abroad Ananti will introduce a new hotel website that is supported in multiple languages including English Japanese and Chinese.In April it also revamped its own member rewards program dubbed Ananti Culture Club which includes the mileage program RIM all separate from Hilton’s. Through the membership programs guests are able to enjoy various perks and privileges.

Founded in 1987 Ananti operates hotels resorts and golf courses across Korea including Ananti At Busan Cove Ananti At Gangnam Ananti Namhae and Ananti Club Jeju.It once operated The Ananti Kumgang Mountain in North Korea but pulled the plug on the golf resort in the hermit kingdom in April last year amid a lagging recovery in inter-Korean relations.The company earned 129.6 billion won ($100 million) in gross profit last year on the back of the booming hotel business in Korea.It is expected to report better earnings this year after raking in 108 billion won in the first three quarters.Mi-Kyoung Lee at capital@hankyung.com Sookyung Seo edited this article.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmhvc3BpdGFsaXR5bmV0Lm9yZy9uZXdzLzQxMTkzODEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Hilton Reveals 2023 CEO Light & Warmth Award Winners,"Hilton (NYSE: HLT) announced today the recipients of its 2023 CEO Light & Warmth Award recognizing 15 individuals and two teams from Hilton-branded hotels.

GE HealthCare and Hologic have used a radiology meeting to push their artificial intelligence capabilities this week presenting technologies designed to improve diagnostic workflows.

BTIG analysts spoke to both companies at the Radiological Society of North America’s annual meeting. The analysts said that GE HealthCare management believes AI can help clinicians and radiologists do their jobs better which is important due to the “ongoing shortage of radiologists and the high rates of burn out.”

The analysts also shared an upbeat update from GE HealthCare which said hospitals have become more optimistic on capital budgets for next year and there is no lingering impact from China’s anti-corruption campaign.

Dive Insight:

GE HealthCare and Hologic have both invested in AI to enhance their offerings to radiologists in recent years. In February GE HealthCare disclosed an agreement to buy Caption Health a provider of AI that assists in conducting ultrasound scans in a deal later revealed to be worth $127 million upfront. The BTIG analysts shared their thoughts on the technology after visiting GE HealthCare’s booth at the event.

“We saw the power of Caption Health and the value additive features it offers on cardiac ultrasound applications. Within 6 months of the acquisition [GE HealthCare] has integrated Caption Health's technology into their own ultrasound equipment” the analysts wrote in a note to investors. “The features are primarily used in ERs but we would expect to see the features move to other ultrasound areas over time.”

GE HealthCare’s management identified four applications for AI in radiology: improved image quality enhanced user capabilities and efficiency diagnosis and quality control. The technology could boost productivity according to the analysts particularly in ultrasound.

Hologic used the event to promote its Genius AI Detection 2.0 solution deep-learning technology for flagging potential breast cancer cases. The company has linked the technology to a more than 70% reduction in false-positive markings per case compared to its own ImageChecker CAD solution.

“Version 1.0 used machine learning algorithms back in 2003 but it had to teach the software what to look for” the BTIG analysts wrote. “Today with Version 2.0 deep-learning capabilities allow fellowship trained radiologists to enter and mark up a few mammography images and the software can learn just from looking at prior data and the software goes pixel by pixel.”

Story continues

Away from AI GE HealthCare provided a broader update on some of the macroeconomic forces that will shape its financial results and those of its peers in the coming quarters. The company’s internal survey data suggests hospitals are becoming more optimistic about their capital budgets a change that could drive purchases of imaging equipment and management was encouraged by a recent trip to China.

GE HealthCare grew revenue year over year by 5% to $4.8 billion in the third quarter despite hospitals operating with more constrained budgets and China’s anti-corruption campaign.

HD,Home Depot,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vZGVybnJldGFpbC5jby9tYXJrZXRpbmcvaG93LWhvbWUtZGVwb3QtaXMtZXhwZXJpbWVudGluZy13aXRoLXNob3BwYWJsZS10di1jb250ZW50LW9uLXZpemlvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Home Depot is experimenting with shoppable TV content on Vizio,"Home Depot is experimenting with whether it can get TV viewers to buy items via a QR code with a shoppable miniseries.

In a partnership with home entertainment brand Vizio “Merry & Bright” is a branded content series currently featured in the rotating collection displayed on a Vizio viewer’s home screen. Hosted by Jordin Sparks of “American Idol” fame the series has the vibe of a home makeover show with a narrative arc around a family whose home gets a holiday makeover using Home Depot merchandise. But the shoppable element comes in the form of QR codes flashed on the screen that bring the user to Home Depot’s Christmas decoration pages.

Christine Reed Home Depot’s director of media said that “Merry & Bright” is the retailer’s opportunity to test an area of marketing that’s yet to become mainstream despite heavy interest from agencies and brands.

“Using a TV as a shoppable medium is a new behavior for customers” Reed told Modern Retail. “We think it is the future we want to lean into that.”

Insider Intelligence found in an April survey that about 57% of ad agency professionals think shoppable TV is “the next frontier” more so than increased personalization or omnichannel ad tracking. Additionally a survey from Samsung Ads and Kerv Interactive found that a quarter of smart TV viewers are already actively shopping while watching TV.

The series is an example of a larger interplay between streaming TV services and brands where shoppable content is becoming a bigger part of campaigns. Amazon is pitching its streaming opportunities to brands and experimenting; more recently it showcased shoppable QR codes during an NFL game for its Black Friday deals. Meanwhile Roku is focused on using shoppable content — like its Action Ads offering — to lure more DTC brands into its growing ad business.

With the series about halfway through — it started Nov. 1 and will air through the end of December — it’s too soon to say how it’s performed. It’s also unclear if the long-form video will end up performing better than shorter 15 or 30 second ad spots that use QR codes. But the series appears to be performing on par with other content on the platform so far; Vizio says the conversion rate has been slightly higher than other home screen hero videos which see an average click-through-rate of .6%.

While Reed said that there could be future shoppable videos she said the biggest focus is learning how to “flatten the funnel” or drive awareness of product with an easy way to make purchases. That requires a mix of storytelling and product descriptions to ensure the viewer doesn’t feel like they’re being hawked merchandise.

“We want to make sure that we’re showing up in an unobtrusive and really authentic way” Reed siad.

For Vizio “Merry & Bright” is part of a new content strategy said its vp of branded content and sales strategy Katlyn Wilson. In addition to focusing on stronger storytelling and creating opportunities for consumer engagement Vizio recently overhauled its operating system to better use ACR (automatic content recognition) data to help improve recommendations. Wilson said that this allows for better targeting of who to display “Merry & Bright” when they turn on their television.

“We know what our viewers are engaging with and the kind of content that they enjoy so we can better target on the front end the type of consumer who we think will best benefit from this type of content” Wilson said. “It’s just a lot more thoughtful deployed as opposed to just kind of running on a network and then hoping that the right viewer finds it.”

In addition to Vizio and Home Depot’s teams putting together the project it was produced by Turn Card Content and created with marketers from OMD’s The Content Collective. The shows were slated to be about 10 minutes each — long enough for a story to unfold and to include some meaty tips for the DIY-er but not a large time commitment. And the QR codes were chosen to flash in the lower third of the screen so they weren’t obtrusive.

“That’s one of the benefits of this new medium is we make the rules and we can decide what best serves the needs of the Home Depot and the partnership” Wilson said.

Liz Kressel founder and CEO of Lizard Strategies said that brands of all sizes are experimenting with shoppable TV content. But the area is still growing and as many firms trim their ad budgets something experimental isn’t always prioritized. Further it has to be executed in a way that makes sense for the viewer to interact with.

“You can’t assume a shopper will pause to grab their phone and scan it” Kressel said. “Or that they’ll rewind the show if they don’t get to scan in time before the code disappears.”

In the case of “Merry & Bright” Kressel said the QR codes that appeared on screen weren’t necessarily on screen long enough for someone to grab their phone if it wasn’t already with them. The destinations also could’ve had more specificity or provided additional engagement opportunities she said like unique product pages discount codes or an email capture like decorating tips.

But this isn’t the first time that Home Depot has toyed around with a new medium to attract and retain customers.

(NASDAQ:COST) is well known for being a global retail giant with a huge moat. The late Charlie Munger (Trades Portfolio) often proclaimed his love for the company: I love everything about Costco. I'm total addict and I'm never going to sell a share. In the U.S. retail chains like The Home Depot Inc.(NYSE:HD) and Floor & Decor Holdings Inc. (NYSE:FND) have copied its business model.

Although these three retailers share similar business models their outcomes and operational efficiencies vary with Costco leading in efficiency followed by Home Depot and then Floor & Decor.

The volume company not a margin company

Costco's business model focuses on generating high sales volumes rather than maximizing profit margins on individual products. Craig Jelinek Costco's CEO also explained the essence of the business: We are the volume company not a margin company.

Shopping at Costco requires a membership. The company offers high-quality products at exceptional prices fostering a loyal customer base that drives substantial traffic and volume. This high traffic grants it significant leverage in negotiations with suppliers. Munger once commented that Costco does not hold investments in inventory. Instead the company delays payment to suppliers until after it has received payment for the products scheduling supplier payments only once the items are slated for sale. This purchasing power enables the retailer to obtain top-quality products at the lowest costs from suppliers further enhancing the value offered to its members.

Costco has the most efficient operations

When examining operating efficiency Costco distinctly outperforms the other two retailers showcasing superior operating performance and efficiency. Over the past decade it has maintained a stunningly high inventory turnover rate with its average days inventory outstanding consistently ranging between 28 and 32 days. In contrast Home Depot exhibits a significantly higher DIO with an average of 65 to 82 days. The most pronounced difference is seen in Floor & Decor which takes the longest time to turn inventory into sales ranging from 152 to 187 daysabout five to six times slower than Costco.

Costco Home Depot and Floor & Decor: Diverging Outcomes From a Similar Model

Regarding the efficiency of collecting payments post-sale Costco again emerged as the leader. Since 2012 its days sales outstanding have been impressively brief ranging from just three to four days. Home Depot follows albeit with a slightly higher DSO of 5.5 to eight days. Although Floor & Decor outperformed Home Depot in 2013 with a marginally lower DSO it has consistently taken the longest to collect payment for its sales from 2014 through 2022 with a DSO in the range of seven to 13 days.

Costco Home Depot and Floor & Decor: Diverging Outcomes From a Similar Model

In terms of supplier payments Floor & Decor has the capacity to delay payments to its suppliers the longest while Costco stands out for paying its suppliers the soonest. This approach aligns logically with Costco's ability to receive payments from sales much more quickly than both Home Depot and Floor & Decor facilitating its faster payment cycle to suppliers.

The cash conversion cycle is an integral metric that combines all three aforementioned efficiency ratios. It is a crucial metric that measures the time a company takes to convert its investments in inventory receivables and other resources into cash flows from sales. Costco's CCC is particularly impressive thanks to its low days sales outstanding and high inventory turnover. This efficiency has not only been consistently remarkable but has also improved over time. Between 2012 and 2019 its CCC remained within a strikingly short range of three to seven days. In 2021 Costco achieved a negative CCC indicating its operations were essentially financed by its vendors. Home Depot while efficient ranks second with a CCC of 31 to 48 days. In stark contrast Floor & Decor's CCC is considerably higher ranging from 75 to 120 days demonstrating a much slower conversion of resources to cash compared to Costco.

Costco Home Depot and Floor & Decor: Diverging Outcomes From a Similar Model

Home Depot has the highest profitability ratios

Due to its low-price strategy Costco has the lowest profit margin among the three companies. Its net margin ranged from just 1.8% to 2.6% while Floor & Decor's profit margin was slightly higher. Home Depot leads in terms of profitability starting with a 6% profit margin in 2012 and gradually climbing to nearly 10.9% at the time of this writing.

In the realm of return on invested capital Home Depot again stands out. Its return on invested capital increased from 19.8% in 2014 reaching a peak of 40.28% in 2018 before stabilizing at 34.34% in 2022. Costco ranks second with a 14.65% return on invested capital while Floor & Decor trails with a significantly lower return on invested capital of only 9.74% in 2022.

Costco Home Depot and Floor & Decor: Diverging Outcomes From a Similar Model

Costco is the highest valued among the three

From 2013 to 2018 the valuations of Home Depot and Costco were quite similar with their Ebitda multiples hovering around 11 times to 16 times. Subsequently however their valuations began to diverge. Costco's multiples increased surpassing those of Home Depot whose Ebitda multiples were more stable. During the past decade Costco's highest Ebitda multiple nearly reached 30 times while Home Depot's peak was at only 19.4. In contrast Floor & Decor has the most fluctuating multiples ranging broadly from 13.2 to as high as 43.

At the time of writing Costco holds the highest valuation with an enterprise value/Ebitda multiple of nearly 21.82. Floor & Decor follows valued slightly lower at 21.65 while Home Depot has the most modest valuation among the three with an enterprise value/Ebitda ratio of only 14.34.

Costco Home Depot and Floor & Decor: Diverging Outcomes From a Similar Model

Key takeaway

Costco has crafted a unique business model that prioritizes volume over margins cultivating an impressive efficiency in inventory turnover and a quick cash conversion cycle. This model not only ensures a consistent flow of high-quality products at competitive prices but also fortifies the company's financial health and customer loyalty. While Home Depot and Floor & Decor have attempted to replicate Costco's successful strategy their outcomes vary significantly. Home Depot though trailing behind in operational efficiency excels in profitability and return on invested capital. Floor & Decor meanwhile faces challenges in inventory turnover and cash conversion reflecting the diverse challenges inherent in the retail sector. Among the three Costco with its excellecent in operating efficiency and Home Depot with the highest margin and return invested on capital seem to fit well in long-term investors' portfolios.

US-based industrial conglomerate Honeywell said the Chinese renewable energy sector's rapidly growing momentum and future growth potential have persuaded it to deepen its cooperation in the country in order to continue promoting the application of its technologies in carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) and hydrogen.

As China goes full throttle on its energy transition with the aim of becoming carbon-neutral before 2060 Honeywell is anticipating more growth as well as local partnership opportunities in China said Liu Maoshu vice-president and general manager of Honeywell Performance Materials and Technologies Asia-Pacific a strategic business group of the global parent company.

China's energy transition is expected to provide massive opportunities for global energy corporations like Honeywell Liu said on the sidelines of the first China International Supply Chain Expo in Beijing on Tuesday.

Honeywell is optimistic about the opportunities brought by the development prospects of China's energy aviation building and petrochemical sectors. There is inherent potential for technological innovation and applications which these sectors have sought to harness in recent years he said adding Honeywell will continue tapping the CCUS sector in China given its massive market potential.

According to the latest China-US statement on enhancing climate cooperation the two countries aim to advance at least five large-scale cooperative CCUS projects each by 2030 including from industrial and energy sources. This is where Honeywell sees huge potential and plans to continue promoting the application of its technologies in China to tap the potential with local partners Liu said.

""Our CCUS solutions are already under commercial application in China and we are looking forward to more cooperation with Chinese partners in the years to come.""

Luo Zuoxian head of intelligence and research at the Sinopec Economics and Development Research Institute said ""Fossil fuels will still be playing a key role in both developing and developed countries in the years to come. As renewable energy still cannot replace the traditional fuel in the short term CCUS offers a way to reduce emissions from sectors that are hard to decarbonize.""

According to a report released by Shell China with an estimated 2400 gigatons in storage capacity has significant geological potential for storing carbon second only to the United States.

Honeywell has signed an agreement with Sennics Co Ltd a subsidiary of Sinochem International Corp to provide processing technologies and services to Sennics' coal hydrogenation and CCUS projects. The two sides will jointly push forward the commercialization of CCUS and coal hydrogenation in China.

""The surging demand for CCUS in China provides Honeywell with a substantial opportunity to grow its energy transition and sustainability business. We firmly believe that this will further help integrate and scale up our growing low-carbon energy offerings in the country"" said Liu.

The best smart thermostats you can buy today:

1. Tado Wireless Smart Thermostat V3+

Stuff Verdict An excellent app and smart radiator values make this the best smart thermostat system you can buy Pros Well-designed simple to use app

Multiroom temp monitoring Cons Lots of plastic

Subscription required to unlock all features

We think the third version of Tado’s Wireless Smart Thermostat is the best smart thermostat out there at the moment. It offers everything in home heating from wired and wireless thermostats to smart radiator valves and even air conditioning control. Our pick of the bunch is the Wireless Smart Thermostat V3+ though.

The Wireless Smart Thermostat V3+ offers ease and accessibility and accommodates a wide range of heating systems. Its geofencing feature will heat your home before you arrive and the app will monitor your heating system for problems and informs on how to solve them independently. It also needs very little DIY skills to get up and running saving money on hidden installation fees.

2. Nest Learning Thermostat (4th Generation)

Stuff Verdict Nest Learning Thermostat is the original smart thermostat and still the most stylish but it misses some key features Pros Stunning design

Plays very nicely with Google Assistant Cons No heating zones

Installation requires professional really

Nest’s learning thermostat is probably the device that made smart thermostats popular. Google claims the Nest will lower energy bills by up to 16% and it’ll look stunning while doing so.

It’s also a smart and intuitive bit of kit. It gets to know how hot or cold you like your living room turns itself down when you’re away and learns how draughty your home is. Bath lovers can also control the boiler through the Nest app and will also show you how much energy you use every day.

3. Hive Thermostat Mini

Stuff Verdict We love this compact and affordable smart thermostat from Hive Pros Affordable

East to use Cons It’s not the smartest thermostat around

Building a whole home system can get expensive

The Hive Thermostat Mini is a favourite amongst the forgetful and those looking to control their energy bills. It can be controlled on a device through the Hive app or by voice and it will alert you should you pop out for the night only to think ‘have I left the heating on?’

The mini can control up to 6 heating zones in your home the same as the more expensive Hive Thermostat and has a frost protection feature which protects your pipes from freezing in winter. It’s also pretty sleek or as sleek as an at-home thermostat can possibly be at least.

Hive is also currently offering 10% off its Thermostat when you subscribe to Hive Heating Plus which keeps track of household carbon emissions and daily weekly and monthly energy insights.

4) Honeywell Evohome

Stuff Verdict The Evohome is like a compact home hub that can control up to 12 heating zones Pros Large screen makes it easy to use

Zonal control and underfloor heating Cons Cheap design

Lacks some smart features

The Honeywell Evohome does everything you’d expect from a smart meter. It’s easy to use can be controlled through an app and can link to Google Home and Alexa. Where the Honeywell Evohome excels though is in its home zoning.

Its smart zoning capabilities mean you only need to heat the areas you’re using whether you want a toasty dining room or a cool bedroom. The Evohome can create up to 12 heating zones and adapts to radiators underfloor heating and stored or shared hot water.

5) Wunda WundaSmart

Stuff Verdict If you have a mansion that needs heating the UndaSmart has support for 30 rooms and 50 radiators Pros Support for large number of rooms

Simple e-ink display Cons Expensive

Professional installation required

Where most smart thermometers offer zoning features WundaSmart takes it to the next level. The WundaSmart supports up to 30 rooms and 50 radiators. This is likely more than enough for the typical non-palatial palace-dwelling person.

The Wunda app is also quick and easy to get to know allowing you to schedule when to heat the house or to boost individual zones. It will also detect when windows are open.

As we turn the page to fiscal 2024 there is urgency across the organization to improve our business. And as we outlined at our recent Investor Day we have identified a clear realistic and achievable path to return the business to its historical earnings trajectory. Our focus going forward is clear: first restore sustainable and dependable bottom-line growth from our current business; second drive savings by minimizing complexity and reducing costs; and third capture incremental value from our investments. Our first milestone will be our performance in fiscal 2024 which is expected to be an investment year for the company. As with any year success will be predicated on how we execute against our strategy. First we must drive focus and growth in our Retail business our nearly $8 billion powerhouse of leading brands talented people and strong capabilities.

Our Retail team has made tremendous progress implementing the Go Forward structure which involved combining seven retail businesses and standing up our Brand Fuel center of excellence. Importantly the Retail team now operates with a single vision and clear strategic focus. We expect this team to win with our consumers and our customers better allocate our resources to drive profitable growth and improve the margin structure of the business. Second we must continue to expand our leadership position in Foodservice. This business has emerged from the pandemic stronger and again delivered excellent results in fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2024 we expect continued growth in Foodservice. We are confident that we can accelerate growth in the key categories of bacon pepperoni prepared proteins and turkey.

Also we can establish a digital leadership position in the industry and expand our presence in the C-Store channel. Third we must aggressively develop our global presence which starts with reigniting growth in our international business. Fiscal 2023 was a particularly challenging year for our international business due to softness in China weak commodity markets and higher-than-expected elasticities on our branded export business. While results in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 are assumed to remain challenged we anticipate a steady recovery beginning in the second quarter. In fiscal 2024 we expect to benefit from more normalized shipments of SPAM to the Philippines and easing of headwinds in our commodity businesses and recovery in China.

As the near-term headwinds abate we anticipate this business to resume delivering accelerated growth. Fourth we must execute our enterprise-wide entertaining and snacking vision by unlocking the power of our brands across the channels where we compete. We are positioned to win in this on-trend category with brands such as Planters Corn Nuts Hormel pepperoni Columbus and Hormel Gatherings. We have been pleased with the momentum we have built in the back half of the year for the Planters business. Data for the latest quarter shows accelerating dollar and unit sales in addition to share household penetration and distribution gains. Much of this momentum is being driven by innovation. Our new flavored cashews line is meeting or exceeding expectations in the marketplace over-indexing with millennial consumers growing household penetration and introducing new consumers to the category.

To capitalize on this success we are launching another flavored cashew variety in fiscal 2024 in addition to a slate of new to market innovations. We have aggressive plans to keep the momentum going for our Planters snack nuts business in fiscal 2024 led by further innovation new distribution brand investments and effective promotional support. We continue to do our part as the category leader to support the Planters and Corn Nuts brands to drive growth for our business the category and for our customers. Fifth we must future-fit our One Supply Chain which means reducing costs and minimizing complexity while investing in long-term growth. We recently announced that we are converting the Barron Wisconsin plant which currently operates turkey harvest and value-added production lines into a value-added facility to support growth across our broader portfolio.

Harvest operations are expected to cease during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. These actions at the Barron facility are consistent with the goals we laid out in late 2021 when we first announced transformational efforts at Jennie-O Turkey Store. We are committed to building a more demand-oriented and optimized turkey portfolio that is better aligned to the changing needs of our customers consumers and operators. The actions at the Barron plant further right-size our turkey supply chain supporting consistent top-line growth improved profitability and decreased exposure to commodity volatility. We are also committed to optimizing the Jennie-O Turkey Store System including freeing up plant space to support growth across the broader Hormel Foods portfolio.

The Barron plant is expected to support high demand and high growth product lines across all areas of the organization. Lastly we are committed to integrating the turkey business into the broader organization to drive efficiencies and growth. Our Retail Foodservice and International segments have been directly supporting the turkey business for a year and we anticipate this continued collaboration to drive long-term growth for the Jennie-O brand and across our entire turkey portfolio. Finally we must transform and modernize our company which is a critical piece to our projected growth over the next three years. At our recent Investor Day we detailed our plans to transform and modernize the organization. Over the next three years we expect to invest approximately $250 million in implementation personnel and project costs including investments in capital expenditures and technology.

We expect around one-third of this investment to be made in fiscal 2024 resulting in a modest benefit to net earnings for the year. Looking to the out-years we are targeting $200 million-plus in operating income growth by fiscal 2026 from the transformation and modernization initiative across the supply chain and portfolio optimization. To be clear we expect a modest benefit to net earnings in 2024 which has been factored into our outlook. We expect benefits to accelerate in fiscal 2025. We expect to achieve our target in fiscal 2026. And we expect this initiative to provide significant residual benefit in fiscal years 2027 and beyond. Through transformational work we expect to build significant capabilities for the future. This is truly exciting work for the organization.

Before I provide further color on our fiscal 2024 outlook I want to briefly detail how we finished fiscal 2023. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $3.2 billion and diluted net earnings per share were $0.36. Excluding the impact of non-cash impairments and investments in transformation and modernization adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $0.42. As expected our Foodservice segment finished the year strong while the risks we identified heading into the quarter including pricing headwinds in turkey lower retail volumes and continued pressures in our International business negatively impacted results. These results were in-line with the low-end of our revenue and adjusted diluted net earnings per share expectations. Turning to our outlook.

For fiscal 2024 we expect to drive modest volume and net sales growth for the full year. This growth is expected to come from our key categories supported by higher brand investments and innovation. In Retail we expect higher net sales across many of our verticals including bacon convenient meals and proteins global flavors emerging brands and snacking and entertaining. We have embedded in our outlook targeted pricing actions a step-up in innovation and higher brand support to drive volume and improved mix. In Foodservice we are anticipating broad volume growth led by turkey pepperoni and bacon. In addition to higher volumes net sales are expected to benefit from higher raw material input markets. In our International business we expect net sales increases to be driven by the branded export business led by SPAM and Skippy and improvement in both the Retail and Foodservice channels in China.

From a bottom-line perspective we expect growth from the Foodservice and International businesses and expect a decline in our Retail segment. While the Retail segment is expected to benefit from sales growth and improved mix we do not anticipate this growth to overcome the significant headwind from the rapid decline in the commodity whole turkey market. For context whole turkey prices began calendar year 2023 at all-time highs and have since fallen below the five-year average. We are closely monitoring sell-through of whole turkeys this holiday season as well as any potential supply impacts from HPAI which has again affected flocks this fall. These are very unusual market dynamics which has added additional risk and uncertainty to our outlook.

Given these factors in turkey we have included in our outlook meaningfully lower market pricing on our high-volume whole turkey business. Similar to the dynamics we experienced in the fourth quarter we expect earnings to decline in the first half of the year due to the impact from lower turkey markets lower volumes in the Retail segment and continued softness in our China business. We expect these pressures to have the greatest impact in the first quarter. Taking all these factors into account we expect net sales growth of 1% to 3% diluted net earnings per share to be $1.43 to $1.57 and adjusted diluted net earnings per share to be $1.51 to $1.65. And we expect a modest benefit to net earnings from our transformation and modernization initiative.

As I alluded to earlier we have embarked on an initiative to return the business to its historical earnings trajectory and deliver on the commitment we made at our Investor Day. To reiterate the key elements of this initiative in fiscal 2024 we expect a year of investment which assumes: underlying growth across many parts of our current business offset by a significant headwind from turkey; higher salaries and normalized employee-related expenses; the impact from our new labor agreement; and higher support for our leading brands. It also assumes investments into our transformation and modernization initiative resulting in a modest benefit to the year and it assumes capturing incremental value from Planters our turkey business integration Go Forward and the investments we've made in additional capacity.

In fiscal 2025 we expect to accelerate growth which assumes strength from the underlying business significant benefits from supply chain savings and portfolio optimization and further strategic value capture. In fiscal 2026 we expect to deliver at least $250 million in operating income growth. As we begin 2024 we remain focused on our strategic priorities executing our transformation and modernization initiative fueling our innovation pipeline and exiting the year with momentum in our business segments. I remain confident that we have the right brands strategy people and culture to deliver on our commitment to improve our business and drive long-term shareholder returns and growth. In closing I want to recognize all the hard work carried out by our team in what was a challenging year.

We successfully completed a very large reorganization made progress addressing near-term challenges facing the business and accelerated the transformational work that will better position the company for future success. At this time I will turn the call over to Jacinth Smiley to discuss detailed financial information related to fiscal 2023 and added color on key drivers to our outlook.

Jacinth Smiley: Thank you Jim. Good morning everyone. Full year net sales were $12.1 billion the second highest net sales achievement in our history. We also delivered $2 billion in gross profit for the year. Full year selling general and administrative expenses increased compared to last year primarily due to an adverse arbitration ruling. On an adjusted basis selling general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales finished comparable to the prior year at 7.1%. Advertising investments for the fiscal 2023 year were $160 million compared to $157 million last year. We have planned another increase in advertising investments in fiscal 2024 as we continue to support our leading brands in the marketplace. For fiscal 2023 equity in earnings of affiliates increased due to significantly higher results from MegaMex Foods.

Operating income for fiscal 2023 was $1.1 billion and adjusted operating income was $1.2 billion. Operating margin and adjusted operating margins were 8.9% and 9.8% respectively. The tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 21.8% marginally higher than last year. The effective rate for fiscal 2024 is expected to be 21% to 23%. For the full year diluted net earnings per share were $1.45. Excluding the impacts of an adverse arbitration ruling non-cash impairments and investments in our transformation and monetization initiative adjusted diluted net earnings per share were $1.61. We remain committed to dividend growth investing in our business and maintaining an investment-grade rating. Our consistent cash flows of more than $1 billion in fiscal 2023 and a disciplined financial strategy directly support these commitments.

In fiscal 2023 we returned a record $593 million to our shareholders in the form of dividends including payment of our 381st consecutive quarterly dividend effective November 15th. We also recently announced an increase in the annual dividend of 3% to $1.13 per share for fiscal 2024. This year will be a remarkable 58th consecutive year of dividend increases. We invested $270 million in capital projects during fiscal 2023 supporting growth for SPAM and for Retail and Foodservice pepperoni. We are investing $280 million in capital projects for fiscal 2024 which includes investments in our Barron facility investments supporting our transformation and modernization initiative and to support high demand Planters items. While 2023 was a challenging year for the company our strong financial position allowed us to continue sharing our successes which included recognizing our team members for the 85th consecutive year through our annual profit sharing program.

We ended the year with $3.3 billion of debt and over $750 million in cash and short-term securities. We remain in-line with our stated goal of 1.5 times to 2 times net debt to EBITDA. Before turning to our outlook I would like to highlight the progress we made during the year reducing inventory. As we committed to earlier in the year we achieved our days sales in inventory target of less than 60 days for the quarter and drove a sequential reduction in dollars of both finished goods and total inventory. Inventories finished the year at $1.7 billion a decrease of $36 million from the beginning of the year. We enter fiscal 2024 with responsible levels of inventory to support and achieve our targeted fill rates with ample production capacity to grow the businesses.

While Jim covered many of the puts and takes embedded in our fiscal 2024 outlook I want to provide additional color around our investments in the business and assumptions on key raw material markets. We are investing for growth in fiscal 2024. Specifically we will be investing in end-to-end planning capabilities infrastructure and software to further our data and analytics capabilities a modernization of our order-to-cash system and incremental headcount to support the plan buy make and move workstreams across our supply chain. We anticipate about one-third of the total investment to be recorded in fiscal 2024. About $0.08 EPS is expected to be one-time with the rest capitalized or included in the ongoing cost structure of the business.

Shifting to the cost environment our fiscal 2024 outlook assumes pork input cost to be higher than last year and to remain above the five-year average. The USDA is projecting modestly higher production and higher exports in 2024. Additionally cold storage levels for pork have trended lower year-over-year and compared to these historical averages which we expect to be supportive of pork markets. Of note these costs are expected to continue to be a headwind in fiscal 2024 as the industry cycles through lower supplies. Turkey sales and volumes continued to recover in the fourth quarter as we grew turkey volumes in each of our segments. The investments behind our value-added turkey portfolio and lean ground business are working with ground volume and dollar sales outpacing the category for the latest four- and 13-week periods.

Turkey markets continued to move lower during the fourth quarter pressuring prices across our channels. We have assumed prices will remain depressed in our fiscal 2024 outlook. We do expect to partially offset these pricing headwinds with lower feed costs. HPAI has reemerged again this fall creating another unusual event affecting our vertically integrated supply chain. At the present time we do not expect supply impacts to the degree we experienced in the first half of fiscal 2023. The situation remains fluid and the risk of additional cases creates a heightened level of uncertainty in the outlook of our turkey business. In closing I too want to recognize the dedication and hard work of over 20000 employees across our great company. In so many ways our team rose to the challenges thrown at them while continuing to deliver safe and trusted products to our customers consumers and operators.

As Jim noted I am proud to confirm that we officially achieved our safest year in the history of the company a testament to all team members who uphold our Safety First culture and keep it at the forefront of our business. This is a key part of the continued success of the company one that can never be taken lightly. At this time I'll turn the call over to the operator for the question-and-answer portion of the call.

After opening the day at $31.55 per share the stock price fell nearly 4.5% to close the day at $30.46 per share. The company was challenged on a variety of fronts throughout the fiscal year that ended Oct. 29 most notably by a decrease in consumer spending volatility in the turkey market and an expected recovery in China.

“… Our results did not meet our expectations” said James P. Snee chairman president and chief executive officer during a Nov. 29 conference call to discuss fiscal 2023 results. “As we turn the page to fiscal 2024 there is urgency across the organization to improve our business.”

Net income for the fiscal year was $793.6 million equal to $1.45 per share on the common stock and down from $1 billion or $1.82 per share the year before.

Sales fell to $12.1 billion from $12.5 billion in fiscal 2022.

In the company’s Retail business unit its largest sales fell 3% to $7.8 billion from $8 billion the year before. Retail volume sold fell 5.9 % to 3 billion lbs from 3.3 billion lbs and segment profit plummeted 20% to $578 million from $722 million the year prior.

In the Foodservice segment sales fell 1.4% to $3.6 billion from $3.7 billion and volume was flat at 1 billion lbs. International segment sales fell 7.5% to $722 million from $779 million the year before while volumes were flat. The International business unit’s profit fell 48.7% to $55 million from $108 million the year before.

Management did not spend much time during the Nov. 29 conference call looking back. Rather the focus was on fiscal 2024 and what the company needs to do to improve results.

“Turning to our outlook for fiscal 2024 we expect to drive modest volume and net sales growth for the full year” Snee said. “This growth is expected to come from our key categories supported by higher brand investments and innovation. In Retail we expect higher net sales across many of our verticals including bacon convenient meals and proteins global flavors emerging brands and snacking and entertaining. We have embedded in our outlook targeted pricing actions a step-up innovation and higher brand support to drive volume and improve mix.”

Management also expects “broad volume growth” in Foodservice let by turkey pepperoni and bacon. In the International segment increases in exports of Skippy and SPAM is anticipated as well as improvement in both the retail and foodservice channels in China.

“From a bottom-line perspective we expect growth from the Foodservice and International businesses and expect a decline in our Retail segment” Snee said. “While the Retail segment is expected to benefit from sales growth and improved mix we do not anticipate this growth to overcome the significant headwind from the rapid decline in the commodity whole turkey market.”

Snee noted that when 2023 started whole-turkey prices were at all-time highs but have since fallen below the five-year average.

“We are closely monitoring sell through of whole turkeys this holiday season as well as any potential supply impacts from HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) which has again affected flocks this fall” he said. “These are very unusual market dynamics which has added additional risk and uncertainty to our outlook.”

He also mentioned a shift of operations decided on earlier this year as part of the company’s strategy moving forward specifically transitioning its Barron Wis. turkey harvesting plant to a dedicated value-added facility.

“Harvest operations are expected to cease during the second quarter of fiscal 2024. These actions at the Barron facility are consistent with the goals we laid out in late 2021 and when we first announced transformational efforts at Jennie-O Turkey Store” Snee said.

The company also is assuming pork input costs will be higher in fiscal 2024 and remain above the five-year average.

“These costs are expected to continue to be a headwind in fiscal 2024 as the industry cycles through lower supplies” said Jacinthe C. Smiley chief financial officer.

The company is forecasting its branded export business will grow beyond the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and that business in China will improve.

“ … It’s early in (fiscal) 2024 but we are seeing some moderate improvement across foodservice and retail (in China)” Snee said. “But we're expecting that to accelerate as we move throughout the year.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RidXNpbmVzc25ld3MubmV0L2FydGljbGVzLzIzMDA4LWxvbmd0aW1lLWhvcm1lbC1leGVjLWpvaW5zLW9yZ2FuaWMtdmFsbGV5LWFzLWNlb9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Longtime Hormel exec joins Organic Valley as CEO,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/23008-longtime-hormel-exec-joins-organic-valley-as-ceo on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RidXNpbmVzc25ld3MubmV0L2FydGljbGVzLzIzMDA4LWxvbmd0aW1lLWhvcm1lbC1leGVjLWpvaW5zLW9yZ2FuaWMtdmFsbGV5LWFzLWNlb9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZHZhbnRhZ2VuZXdzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2dyYW5pdGUtY2l0eS1uYW1lcy1uZXctc2Nob29sLXN1cGVyaW50ZW5kZW50L2FydGljbGVfNzkxMTdjZjgtOTA3NS0xMWVlLThjMjAtOGYzNzVkMzllNzZiLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Granite City names new school superintendent | Local News | advantagenews.com,"Alton IL (62002)

The ""ER"" star discussed the perceived lack of support for Israel in its war against Hamas on a Nov. 20 of ""The Back Room With Andy Ostroy"" which went viral on social media this week.

""It’s those kids who are spewing this antisemitic hate that have no idea if they stepped foot in an Islamic country"" Margulies said. ""These people who want us to call them they/them or whatever they want us to call them ... It’s those people that will be the first people beheaded and their heads played with a soccer ball. Like a soccer ball on the field.""



Margulies also discussed a Columbia University organization's recent exclusion of Jewish students from a film night. The actress claimed she was ""more offended by it as a lesbian than I am as a Jew.""

""I want to say to them ‘you f---ing idiots you don’t exist [to Hamas]. You’re even lower than the Jews [to Hamas]'"" she said of the event's organizers. ""'A. You’re Black. B. You’re gay. And you’re turning your back against the people who support you because Jews they rally around everybody.”

Margulies argued the Black community may have been ""brainwashed"" to hate Jewish people despite their support for the civil rights movement.

""The Jews were the ones that walked side by side with the Blacks to fight for their rights. And now the Black community isn’t embracing us and saying we stand with you the way you stood with us?"" the star of ""The Good Wife"" said. ""Jews died for their cause. Where’s the history lesson in that? Who’s teaching these kids?”

The actress also called out young progressives' alleged hypocrisy. She cited the recent t of Osama bin Laden's ""Letter to America"" which justified the 9/11 attacks on TikTok.

""These kids are calling Jews colonialists. If you’re going with that argument kids then get the f--k out of America"" Margulies stated. ""Because you were not here first. Native Americans were here first and you owe them a big f---ing apology.”

""I guess that's what’s happening to the crazy people out there who are getting their news from TikTok which in my estimation — after this whole Osama bin Laden letter — should be banned. TikTok should be banned"" she continued.

Margulies's sentiments stand in contrast to those of other celebrities. Actress Susan Sarandon was dropped by her talent agency last month for antisemitism in the U.S. arguing Jewish people are ""getting a taste of what it feels like to be Muslim.""

The National Desk (TND) reached out to Margulies's publicist for comment but did not immediately receive a response."

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

article 5 Min Read Host Awaits Return of Consistent Hotel Demand in Maui None of Host Hotels & Resorts' three Maui resorts were damaged by the August wildfires but a significant number of bookings were canceled for the fourth quarter. Dan Kubacki Social

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

HWM,Howmet Aerospace,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9ob3dtZXQtcHJvdGVjdGlvbi1mLTM1LXByb2dyYW0tMDEyMjAwNTMyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Howmet's Protection of the F-35 Program Despite Lockheed Martin's Actions,"PITTSBURGH December 02 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Howmet Aerospace (NYSE:HWM) wishes to briefly comment on the lawsuit filed by Lockheed Martin yesterday concerning the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program (the ""F-35 Program""). Contrary to the allegations in Lockheed Martin’s complaint Howmet takes its contractual and regulatory obligations seriously and believes it has complied with those obligations in all material respects.

Howmet has been a proud supplier to Lockheed Martin and other entities that participate in the F-35 Program for decades. Howmet supplies titanium ingot billet sheet and plate (the ""Products"") to Lockheed Martin and other customers that also serve as suppliers to Lockheed Martin (collectively and including Lockheed Martin the ""Customers""). The Products are made by mixing titanium sponge and titanium scrap metal that is reverted back to Howmet by its Customers to recycle into new Product.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in early 2022 dramatically reduced global titanium sponge supply. As a result Howmet’s titanium sponge suppliers drastically increased their prices contrary to their agreements with Howmet.

At the same time further exacerbating the situation Lockheed Martin permitted Customers to sell their revert scrap metal to third parties rather than provide it to Howmet as contractually required. This allowed the Customers to profit from highly inflated prices on the open market.

Despite these significant challenges Howmet continued to purchase titanium sponge and titanium scrap metal on the open market in order to supply the F-35 Program and our Customers including Lockheed Martin.

Since 2022 Howmet has been transparent with Lockheed Martin about these challenges and has acted in good faith to attempt to reach a reasonable resolution for the benefit and long-term health of the F-35 Program. While such discussions were still ongoing Lockheed Martin unfortunately chose to file a meritless lawsuit seeking to compel Howmet to continue to supply Product at prices that no longer reflect commercial reality and on terms that Howmet believes it is not contractually obligated to provide. Howmet looks forward to defending itself vigorously in court against Lockheed Martin’s claims. In the meantime Howmet remains open to discussing a reasonable resolution.

The withholding of materials “threatens substantial delays” in the company’s construction and deliveries of the fighter jets according to the lawsuit.

The suit filed in a U.S. District Court in Fort Worth on Nov. 30 is against Howmet Aerospace Inc. Headquartered in Pittsburgh Howmet Aerospace manufactures titanium sheets plates bars and ingots that are used to construct aircrafts for companies. Howmet has supplied the materials for Lockheed for about 20 years according to the lawsuit.

F-35s are assembled in Fort Worth and the Department of Defense plans to procure about 2500 F-35s over the program’s life cycle according to previous reporting. The company relies on more than 1000 subcontractors across the country to build the F-35 which requires thousands of parts.

Howmet started communicating about the higher costs of obtaining titanium raw materials in late 2022 and requested Lockheed to renegotiate its contract.

But Lockheed said it couldn’t change without “appropriate documentation” since the contract is with the U.S. Department of Defense. Lockheed alleges Howmet did not provide the necessary documentation to alter the contract.

On Nov. 22 Howmet allegedly communicated to Lockheed that it would stop supplying the materials at the prices in the subcontract and “demanded that Lockheed Martin and those other subcontractors agree to a massive price increase.” The lawsuit says Howmet allegedly failed to deliver titanium materials used for manufacturing the F-35 and Lockheed argues Howmet is breaching the subcontract.



“Howmet has stated unequivocally that it will no longer perform its obligations under the subcontract and will continue to breach them unless Lockheed Martin and/or the other Lockheed Martin subcontractors agree to negotiate and substantially increase the prices specified in the subcontract” the lawsuit states. “Even though the subcontract states that even if there are disputes between the parties while those disputes are being discussed or resolved Howmet ‘shall diligently proceed with the performance of this Contract as directed by Lockheed Martin.’”

Lockheed is trying to force Howmet to deliver the materials under the contract or a monetary award from damages according to the lawsuit.

In a company statement Howmet denied Lockheed’s allegation and said it takes its contract obligations seriously and believes it has fulfilled its obligations.



“Howmet looks forward to defending itself vigorously in court against Lockheed Martin’s claims. In the meantime Howmet remains open to discussing a reasonable resolution” the company states.



In a statement to the Fort Worth Report a Lockheed Martin spokesperson said the company does not comment on pending litigation. The company did not respond to questions about whether the withheld parts would delay F-35 deliveries.

Lockheed Martin delayed the date for the newest version of the F-35 due to software issues in September. The company previously told the Fort Worth Report it will continue to produce 156 jets per year. Countries such as the Czech Republic are ordering the jets. According to a Lockheed Martin fact sheet the company has delivered more than 975 of the jets as of Nov. 1.

In times of war investors' thoughts naturally may turn to defense stocks. Continuing wars in Ukraine and Israel and Gaza along with various simmering geopolitical hotspots around the world could mean increased revenues for U.S. defense contractors enhancing the allure of stocks in the aerospace and defense category. Though aerospace and defense funds understandably haven't done well in this year's faltering market some individual stocks have posted substantial gains. And now that the overall market has started moving upward in recent weeks this could be an advantageous time for investors to consider the category. Government sales account for varying amounts of revenues received by aerospace/defense companies — from 100% down to 30% or less in some cases.

Diversified revenue creates a 'sweet spot'

As the label aerospace and defense implies many such companies have civilian business from jetliner manufacturers and airlines so the current boom in commercial aviation is a positive for them. This diversification currently puts them in a sweet spot. Though U.S. defense spending on contractors has been pared back a bit over last couple years some aerospace and defense firms continue to benefit from total contract spending that increased markedly in 2017-2020 from $373.5 billion to $448.9 billion rising with the total defense budget.

U.S. support in what's turning out to be a long war in Ukraine will likely push overall contractor spending higher benefitting aerospace and defense companies. In this era of high-tech warfare when strategic military engagement is more about digital systems and aerial weapons than boots on the ground aerospace and defense companies are advantageously positioned. Lucrative products include fighter jets helicopters parts for them avionics products missile guidance system drones and anti-drone technology and support services.

Lesser-known companies have key market positions

Publicly traded companies in this category with relatively low downside risk (based on various fundamental metrics) and good growth projections include some familiar names of large companies including General Dynamics  Lockheed Martin and Northrup Grumman . Yet standing out from such behemoths are some lesser known and/or smaller companies whose key market positions and robust growth projections may signal greater potential for investors. Among them are these six: TransDigm Group Inc. (TDG) Projected average annual earnings growth over five years according to FactSet: 26%

Market cap: $48 billion (as of mid-November) TransDigm designs and manufactures original aircraft parts for manufacturers and aftermarket replacement parts for operators of commercial and military aircraft. Most of its revenue is from civilian aviation sources. The company is benefiting from the integration of global economies which is spurring jetliner fleet additions and from pricing power as the sole supplier of some items. Though its trailing 12-month price/earnings ratio is high at 47 this multiple has been pushed up by stock price growth of about 15% over the past six months as of mid-November. Parsons Corp. (PSN) Projected five-year annual earnings growth: 13%.

Market cap: $6.5 billion. This global technology company gets most of its revenue from federal agencies both defense and civilian. Parsons Corp. clients include the U.S. Department of Defense the Missile Defense Agency the State Department Department of Homeland Security the Department of Energy and the Federal Aviation Administration. Products and services include items to counter unmanned air systems and gear for national security bio-surveillance space launches border security rail design/control and infrastructure engineering. The stock prices has increased about 36% over the past six months bringing the trailing P/E up to 48.

Born on August 4 1956 in Cold Spring Harbor New York Whitman attended the Cold Spring Harbor High School before enrolling at Princeton University where she earned a bachelor's degree in economics. Following this she obtained an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1979.

Whitman began her career in brand management at Procter & Gamble following which she joined Bain & Company as a consultant. She then took on executive roles at various firms including The Walt Disney Company where she was Senior Vice President of Marketing and Hasbro where she oversaw the global management and marketing of the Playskool and Mr. Potato Head brands.

In 1998 Whitman joined eBay a then-fledgling online auction platform as its President and CEO. Under her stewardship eBay grew from a company with 30 employees and US$4m in annual revenue to a global enterprise employing 15000 people with almost US$8bn in revenue by the time she stepped down in 2008. She was instrumental in launching initiatives like ‘Buy it Now’ and led the company through its initial public offering (IPO) in 1998.

“The challenge at eBay was how to keep up with a 70% compound monthly growth rate” Whitman said in a 2016 interview with Harvard Business Review. “But the principles of leadership were the same: clear strategy well communicated well metricked. Celebrate the victories and hold people including yourself accountable for results. When you’re the CEO of a 30-person company that grows to 15000 people as eBay did you have to keep reinventing yourself as the company scales.”

After leaving eBay Whitman ventured into politics running as a Republican candidate for the Governor of California in 2010 but was defeated by Jerry Brown. She returned to the business arena in 2011 as the CEO of Hewlett-Packard. At HP she faced the enormous task of reviving the struggling tech giant. She initiated significant restructuring including the decision to split the firm into two separate companies: HP Inc focused on printers and personal computers and Hewlett Packard Enterprise focused on servers storage and networking.

“The biggest challenge facing the company was that it had too many CEOs in too short a period of time” Whitman said. “I was the third CEO in as many years. That is really tough on a company. And the three CEOs had quite different strategies. When you make changes at the centre they get amplified on the ground in Singapore or Berlin or Rio. The company was not sure what its strategy was and therefore it was difficult for everyone to execute.”

After stepping down as the CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise in 2018 Whitman's next venture was Quibi a short-form streaming platform created by Jeffrey Katzenberg. Launched in April 2020 the platform aimed to revolutionise mobile-first entertainment but struggled to gain traction. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and lacklustre performance Quibi shut down just six months after its launch.

Whitman has been recognised numerous times for her contributions to business. She has been featured on Forbes' list of The World's 100 Most Powerful Women multiple times and has received several honorary degrees.

Whitman was confirmed in a unanimous vote by the U.S. Senate as the 18th United States Ambassador to Kenya on July 14 2022. “The U.S.-Kenya partnership is strong built on sixty years of shared values and interests” she wrote in an official post. “Our partnership has enhanced security increased prosperity and improved the lives of Kenyans and Americans.

“Since I arrived in Kenya my team and I have been laser-focused on strengthening the U.S.-Kenya trade and investment relationship in coordination with the Kenyan government.”

Whitman is married to Dr Griffith Harsh a neurosurgeon. They have two grown sons and two grandchildren.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9ocC1zbWFydC10YW5rLTUxMDEtcmV2aWV3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP Smart Tank 5101 review: when paper jams hurt,"Digital Trends may earn a commission when you buy through links on our site. Why trust us?

HP Smart Tank 5101 MSRP $250.00 Score Details “The HP Smart Tank 5101 has its strengths but suffers from software issues and cost-cutting measures.” Pros Extremely low cost per page

Two-year supply of ink included

Photo prints look good on plain paper

Scanner is fast with good quality

Optical character recognition works reliably Cons Tiny icon LCD and buttons are confusing

Faint lines in glossy prints

Paper jams are difficult to clear

HP’s Smart Tank 5101 is a compact all-in-one printer that comes with enough ink to last for a year or longer. That’s the great thing about tank printers — They eliminate the ongoing need to order new cartridges. Since the Smart Tank 5101 includes a scanner it can serve multiple purposes for your home office including copying scanning and printing.

HP is a reliable brand but not all printers are equal. You want a tried-and-true printer that’s not too expensive to run and that’s compatible with all your devices. And in my testing the Smart Tank 5101 just has a few too many problems compared to the competition.

Design

HP’s Smart Tank 5101 is a nice-looking printer. The off-white sides and gray lid have nicely rounded corners. At the lower left four translucent windows show the levels for the black cyan magenta and yellow inks. Like most tank printers the color doesn’t show through but HP added a color stripe to each tank that matches the color inside. It’s a nice touch for visual confirmation of which ink is low on the rare occasion that happens.

The output bin is in the front and a clever rotating arm unfolds to catch your prints. A 100-sheet paper tray is in the back extending the depth of the printer.

With all trays open the HP Smart Tank 5101 has a footprint of 17.1 inches wide by 22.9 inches deep. There’s no automatic document feeder (ADF) and the height is a short 11 inches even with paper in the tray. If you need to copy multipage documents you should check out our list of the best all-in-one printers.

The display is a bit unusual. It’s a 1.2-inch icon display which is exactly what it sounds like. It’s not terribly useful to see icons on an LCD when there are also icons in LED lights and buttons below that screen. The lack of information is disheartening when problems arise.

Printing performance

The Smart Tank 5101 has surprisingly good photo print quality on plain paper as HP claims. That’s important if you want low-cost color. Even if ink is inexpensive the cost of letter-size glossy photo paper is about 20 cents per sheet.

The crisp quality and brightness that you get with photo paper are worth the expense for your best pictures but everyday photos and documents will be much more affordable if you can print them on plain paper.

It’s no surprise that the HP Smart Tank 5101 prints bright sharp pictures on photo paper though colors are a bit muted. It can’t match the dynamic range of a six-color printer like the Epson EcoTank 8500 but HP designed the Smart Tank 5101 to fill the needs of families.

Borderless printing works well but I can notice faint lines in the glossy prints if I look closely. That could be due to a bad paper jam I experienced on the first print. Clearing this paper jam required an unusual and significant amount of effort including disconnecting the printheads and flipping the printer on its face to pull paper from a bottom hatch. After running printhead alignment several times the lines persisted.

Printing black-and-white documents and labels is quick. HP rates the Smart Tank 5101 at 12 pages per minute (ppm) for monochrome but it slows to 5 ppm (12 seconds per page) for an average color document.

That’s slower than most budget printers and HP’s prices are in the low to midrange. For example Brother’s inexpensive tank-like MFC-J1205W printer averages a speedy 9 ppm for color documents.

Special features

The HP Smart Tank 5101 is an all-in-one so it includes scanning and copying functions. It takes some time to figure out how to copy. I’d develop muscle memory for the controls after some time but the printer’s control panel is unintuitive.

Copying works well in most cases. The scanner is fast and has good quality. When making multiple copies of the same original you can output 10 ppm in monochrome and 2 ppm in color.

Most documents have margins and scan well. When I tried a handwritten page that went right to the edge the scan cut off the right edge. I tried again aligning it carefully but the side was missing again. Canon’s PIXMA G4270 MegaTank seems more reliable but it had a similar problem when copying documents with narrow margins. I think a full-page scanner should copy the entire page.

HP’s software includes options for multi-photo scanning and optical character recognition. OCR works well suggesting the HP Smart app has been improved since I reviewed the HP Envy Inspire 7955e which suffered from some software issues. The multi-photo scan seems to be unreliable however. It failed to recognize separate pictures when scanning.

Software and compatibility

Since the Smart Tank 5101 lacks a proper screen setup is best done with the HP Smart app. Make sure you are logged into a network that supports 2.4GHz since the printer requires that. It took me a couple of tries before getting connected but it wasn’t too fussy.

HP includes four full bottles of ink with the Smart Tank 5101 and I was prepared to spend a few minutes waiting for them to drain into their respective chambers. But in just a few seconds each big bottle was finished. Despite the free-flowing ink there were no spills. HP designed the bottles and tanks very well.

Printheads need to be installed which is a quick but unusual step for a tank printer. Next I started printhead alignment which was refreshingly simple. HP simplifies the process by printing a single sheet that I transfer to the scanner for automatic adjustment. In theory this sounds good but I did have an issue with faint lines.

With an inkjet printer I usually start testing with a photo from my iPhone. I immediately experienced a problem. The HP Smart app didn’t show the proper paper sizes. There was no option to choose letter-size paper and it defaulted to 3.5 x 5 photo paper. The size options contained A4 and a few other European paper sizes.

I’m in Canada so perhaps that was part of the problem but we use the same paper as the U.S. I’ve tested plenty of HP printers without encountering this problem. After a few days HP support got back to me with a solution. In Settings > Language & Region >Measurement System choose US instead of Metric.

Everything worked normally from my Windows PC Mac and Android phone.

Initial cost vs. long-term value

The HP Smart Tank 5101 is inexpensive for an inkjet tank printer. Still $250 might seem expensive compared to inkjets that sell for about $100. However the cost disappears over time. This is for two reasons.

First HP includes four full bottles of ink providing 6000 monochrome pages and 8000 color pages. HP estimates this will last for up to two years. I didn’t see the level drop despite voluminous printing. Second the cost of ink is incredibly low.

While cartridge-based printers like Epson’s Expression Premium XP-7100 have a cost-per-page (cpp) as high as 16 cents just for the ink the Smart Tank 5101 averages just six-tenths of a cent per color document. Black-and-white pages cost about half that.

Considering I enjoyed decent photo quality while using plain paper the HP Smart Tank 5101 offers remarkably low running costs for color as well as black-and-white.

Is this the printer for you?

The HP Smart Tank 5101 is a printer with lots of potential. Unfortunately faint lines on photo prints the tiny icon display and the awkward troubleshooting method are holding it back.

HP quickly offered a solution for the paper size mismatch. The alignment issue could be more difficult. If it’s just a matter of correcting software calibration that problem could disappear. If it’s the result of damage caused while clearing a paper jam that’s unfortunate because jams happen sometimes.

If you can find the Smart Tank 5101 on discount it might do you well enough but there are better more affordable all-one-printers out there that could offer more value.

Antonio Neri: Thanks Jeff and good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. In fiscal year…

Operator: Pardon me this is the conference operator. The speaker's line has appears to have dropped. Please remain on the line while we rejoin them. Thank you.

Antonio Neri: Eddie can you hear us?

Operator: Yes sir we can hear you now. Thank you.

Antonio Neri: All right thank you. Well thanks Jeff and good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. In fiscal year 2023 HPE delivered record performance against non-GAAP financial metrics by capitalizing on strong momentum across our portfolio. Our steady execution has resulted in higher revenue further gross margin expansion larger operating profit and record-breaking non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow. Our growth engines in Intelligent Edge and HPC and AI as well as our HPE GreenLake platform are helping to accelerate our revenue and profit diversification. Importantly HPE has achieved demonstrable success this year in our ongoing portfolio pivot to higher growth higher margin areas aligned to the key market megatrends driving customer demand.

I will focus my commentary today on our full-year fiscal year 2023 results and allow Jeremy to expand on the fourth quarter and segment results. I'm very proud of all that HPE delivered in fiscal year 2023 for our shareholders our customers and our team members. Our performance demonstrates the relevance of our strategy our portfolio differentiation and our strong execution. We delivered extraordinary innovation to customers resulting in share gains in key markets and profitable growth for our company. HPE generated our highest gross margin and highest operating profits since I became CEO and our highest annual revenue in four years. Non-GAAP diluted net earnings per share and free cash flow were the largest ever in our company's history.

We saw healthy sustained growth in revenue at $29.1 billion for the full-year an increase of 5.5% year-over-year in constant currency a third straight year of revenue [Technical Difficulty] point of our full fiscal year 2023 guidance of 5%. Gross margins exceeded 35%. We also added substantially to our annualized revenue run rate closing fiscal year 2023 with more than $1.3 billion in ARR. That represents a nearly $370 million increase from this time last year. Non-GAAP operating profit margin was up 20 basis points year-over-year to end the year at 10.8%. We have executed well on our addressable market opportunities and exercised prudence with our expenses and obligations. Non-GAAP EPS increased 6.4% year-over-year to $2.15. Improved profitability also means that we have significantly boosted free cash flows which rose by about $400 million this year to $2.2 billion and nearly 25% year-over-year increase.

Both non-GAAP EPS and free cash flow results are record-breaking and well above our fiscal year 2022 sum guidance. In summary HPE delivered an impressive set of results in fiscal year 2023. With the progress we have made this year and are confidence in generating further value for our shareholders we are raising our dividends in 2024. HPE is more relevant than ever to our customers. We have deliberately aligned our strategy over the last few years to significant trends in the market around edge hybrid cloud and AI. These growth engines align to our customers' interests and where they are targeting their IT spend. Even against an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop we saw continued though uneven demand across our HPE portfolio with a significant acceleration in AI orders.

Demand in our AI solutions is exploding. We saw a significant uptick in customer demand in recent quarters for accelerated computing infrastructure and services. In Q4 orders for servers that include accelerated processing units or APUs represented 32% of our total server order mix up more than 250% from the beginning of fiscal year 2023. APUs which includes GPU-based servers orders across our business represented 25% of our total server order mix in fiscal year 2023. Our HPC & AI segment revenue grew 25% year-over-year in fiscal year 2023. We ended this fiscal year with the largest HPC & AI order book on record driven by $3.6 billion in company-wide APU orders. This tops what has been an historically large order book in the third quarter as demand accelerated for our supercomputing and AI solutions.

We anticipate demand next fiscal year will remain very strong. We likely have a large order backlog and the GPU supply is less constrained. Two weeks ago at the Supercomputing Conference we expanded our collaboration with NVIDIA to announce a turnkey pre-configured supercomputing solution for generative AI to streamline the model development process. The new solution speeds up the training and fine-tuning of AI models using [Indiscernible] data sets. Designed for large enterprises research institutions and government organizations it comprises HPE AI software our industry-leading supercomputing and storage solutions. Our HPE Slingshot Interconnect Fabric and HPE services and the Quad NVIDIA Grace Hopper GH200 Superchip. Later this week at HPE Discover Barcelona we will further expand our NVIDIA partnership with new solutions created for enterprise customers.

Also this month the University of Bristol announced that HPE has been selected to deliver the U.K.'s fastest supercomputer thanks to our U.K. government investment of GPB225 million intended to make the nation a world leader in AI. The Japan National Institute of Information and Communications Technology recently turned to HPE Cray XD supercomputers to develop an AI-based multilingual communication tool to process translate and interpret text and images for 17 languages. And we just announced a partnership with Dark Bite a provider of next-generation high-performance computing green data centers to power its AI cloud service with HPE Cray supercomputers and our purpose-built machine learning software suite. With HPE built supercomputers consistently ranked among monthly top 10 within the top 500 most powerful and sustainable supercomputers our clear leadership in this space continues to position us well in the AI market.

Our Intelligent Edge segment was the largest driver of our revenue and profit growth in fiscal year 2023 making up 18% of our overall revenue and 39% of the segment operating profit. Fiscal year 2023 revenue in this segment increased by 45% to $5.2 billion while operating margins expanded more than 1200 basis points year-over-year to 27.3% demonstrating the relevance of our offering and the payoff of investments over time. A critical part of our intelligent edge portfolio in the edge supply portfolio is to continue -- will continue to contribute meaningfully to profitable growth for our shareholders. The compute segment is going through a cyclical period where customers are consuming prior investments making this a price-competitive market for now.

As we prepare to capture a greater share of AI linked inferencing opportunities we saw overall demand improved moderately in the second-half and are encouraged in our outlook for this segment. Customer interest in service with ATUs is growing. We are investing in specialized sales resources that can enhance future growth. We also know we must keep our focus on capturing heavy unit in this business while keeping balancing our operating margin performance. The overall storage market has been sluggish this year. And on our -- even our uneven performance in this segment is in line with most of our peers. However we are encouraged with three quarters of stable demand. We saw sequential improvement in storage revenue in the fourth quarter. We continue to invest in our sales execution capabilities.

We recently deployed a large specialized store sales force including a team devoted to growing our storage IP product mix. We expect our subscription-based offerings and differentiated IP problems like HP Electra will continue to be sources of strong growth to enhance the profitability of this business in the year ahead. We remain focused on advancing our position in Hybrid Cloud. We ended the year with 29000 customers on our HPE GreenLake cloud platform. Customers require a hybrid by design IT estate. They are attracted to our cloud platform because of its experience flexibility and cost. In the fourth quarter we closed our largest HPE GreenLake for private cloud enterprise deal to-date. In addition we saw more customer demand around our HPE GreenLake SaaS offerings across data protection observability and sustainability services.

Finally our HPE Financial Services segment continues to deliver strategic sustainable solutions for customers accelerating our strategy and helping to expand earnings for our shareholders. Financing volumes rose year-over-year with a major contribution from efforts to boost our other service volumes through HP GreenLake. Fiscal year 2023 was an important year for HP one we advanced our strategy and delivered record financial performance for our shareholders through focused execution and operating discipline. I'm confident in our ability to continue to deliver for our shareholders in fiscal year 2024 and beyond for three main reasons. First the work we have done over the last several years to innovate and invest in the right places places where we have the expertise and the ability to scale has given us a portfolio that I believe stands apart from any other.

Second we have weathered cyclical dynamics well. While others have had much more severe shift to make we have been able to stay the course in bringing our strategy to life because we have made operational improvements and have managed expenses in a disciplined way. And finally we have been bold in undertaking transformation across the company. The changes we have made to our operating model to strengthen capabilities in our growth segment focus on our road maps across the portfolio create new customer experience and reach them in new ways will each pay off next year and beyond. We are set up very well to navigate the current climate with and for our customers and to add significantly to the long-term profitability and value we create for our shareholders.

While headwinds remain in certain segments of the IT market HPE is positioned very well to continue our momentum and we are lesser focused in areas where we know we can do more to improve our performance. I hope you share my optimism in what HP can achieve in the year ahead. Let me now invite Jeremy to discuss the fourth quarter and specific same year results. So Jeremy over to you.

Jeremy Cox: Thank you very much Antonio. We closed FY '23 with another solid performance. Our Q4 results reflect our strategic focus to diversify our business towards higher growth higher margin areas of the market. The company's transformation we have undertaken several years ago to pivot to edge and cloud is paying off. And with AI exploding in 2023 we see several promising indicators as we look further in 2024 and despite some unevenness in some areas of the IT market where we participate. Q4 performance was highlighted by healthy revenues and gross margins. Revenue grew 5% sequentially in constant currency to $7.4 billion. hitting the midpoint of our Q4 revenue guidance range. Year-over-year revenue however was down 6% on a difficult compare to Q4 '22 during which significant order book consumption boosted our results.

Q4 non-GAAP gross margin was 34.8% which was up 170 basis points year-over-year largely due to the increasing contribution of our Intelligent Edge segment. Let me remind you of the deliberate targeted investment decisions we made in Q4 that I flagged to SAM which were funded with the better-than-expected OIE performance in the same period. The impact of this investment along with the strong seasonal growth in HPC and AI resulted in a Q4 non-GAAP operating margin of 9.7%. This is down 60 basis points sequentially and 180 basis points year-over-year. We expect non-GAAP operating margins to quickly be over in Q1 '24. This led to GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.49 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to $0.52 which was at the high end of our Q4 guidance range of $0.48 to $0.52.

Our Q4 free cash flow of $2.3 billion was record-breaking for the company. HPE also delivered an impressive full year performance in FY '23. We delivered revenue growth of 5.5% in constant currency which was at the upper end of our guidance range of 4% to 6%. Currency was a 330 basis point headwind for the year. Non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $2.15 and was also at the high end of our prior guidance and well above our initial guidance from SAM 2022 $1.96 to $2.04. FY '23 free cash flow of $2.2 billion was well above our guidance of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. Let's now turn to our segment results. As a reminder all revenue growth rates on this slide are in constant currency and I will discuss the segments in our prior structure. The company is now operating according to our new structure.

And as communicated at SAM we plan to file restated historical financials for the new segments well before we report our Q1 '24 results. In Intelligent Edge we grew revenue 40% year-over-year in Q4. Demand in our core product was down sequentially on customer digestion but grew in our software-centric solutions such as our HP Aruba Central cloud management software and in our new TAM opportunities such as our SASE security software suite. Our operating margin of 29.5% was up more than 1600 basis points year-over-year. While very pleased with this performance we continue to expect a mid-20% operating margin over time as communicated at SAM 2023. And finally we're making progress on our order book and expect to be back close to historical normal levels by midyear 2024.

In HPC & AI Q4 revenue grew 38% year-over-year and 41% sequentially. Q4 revenue results included only a modest amount of AI revenue. On a sequential basis the continued strength in AI demand lifted our order book in the HPC & AI segment to more than $3 billion despite our significant revenue growth in the quarter. We continue to expect double-digit revenue growth in the segment over the next three years and we are increasingly confident we will be above trend in FY '24 with GPU supply or gating factor. Our Q4 operating margin was 4.7% up 120 basis points year-over-year and 550 basis points sequentially. While we have much more progress to make this does illustrate the positive benefits of scale. The early stage of the AI market tightness in certain key accelerators and long lead times in this segment means that the HPC & AI margins will fluctuate.

Storage revenues fell 12% year-over-year on a difficult compare but rose 3% sequentially. Storage demand has now been flat to up for three straight quarters. HPE Electra revenue grew over 50% year-over-year and it will remain a robust growth contributor in FY '24 supported by growth in file and object storage. HPE Electra is shifting our mix within storage to higher-margin software subscription revenue which is a key driver of our ARR growth. Q4 storage operating margin of 8.1% was down 730 basis points year-over-year. Headwinds included the deferred revenue impact of the HP Electro subscription software accelerated investment outpacing year-over-year revenue performance and a high mix of third-party products this quarter. Our investments in product portfolio give us confidence storage will make progress through FY '24 toward our long-term operating profit margin target communicated at SAM 2023 of mid-teens.

Compute revenue was down 30% year-over-year on a difficult compare and down 1% sequentially. De elongation and customer digestion we discussed previously continued to be most prevalent in compute. Declining AUPs from a record high in Q1 '23 was also a meaningful driver. However two straight quarters of sequential improvement in demand lends further confidence to our FY '24 outlook. Our full-year operating margin of 13.7% exceeded our target range of 11% to 13% but the operating margin of 9.8% in Q4 was temporarily below the range. Given gross margins remain largely flat sequentially and the sequential demand increases we continue to expect operating margins to be in the target range for FY '24. HPE Financial Services revenues were flat year-over-year and financing volume was $1.5 billion.

Our operating margin of 8.9% was down 220 basis points year-over-year reflecting rapid intra sites that we are offsetting through pricing as well as asset management margins returning to normal as supply challenges ease. Our Q4 loss ratio remained steady at 0.5%. Let's double-click on our portfolio pivot to higher growth higher margin recurring revenue and in particular to Intelligent Edge. Even three years ago the Intelligent Edge segment constituted just 10% of segment revenue. This year it represented 18%. The operating profit trajectory is even more telling. The Intelligent Edge segment contributed approximately 14% of the segment's operating profit three years ago and was nearly 40% in FY '23. In FY '24 we intend to give you a similar view combining our growth pillars of HPC and AI hybrid cloud and intelligent edge segments.

Within that we expect the Intelligent Edge segment growth to moderate in the HPC & AI segment growth to accelerate. Robust demand in our hybrid cloud and as-a-service offerings illustrates the durability of our portfolio shift. ARR exceeded $1.3 billion in Q4. This represented 37% year-over-year growth which is in line with our long-term CAGR target of 35% to 45%. Storage and Intelligent Edge software and services are the fastest-growing components of ARR. We continue to lift HPE GreenLake's value proposition with an increasing mix of higher-margin recurring software and services revenue. Our software and services mix was 68% in the quarter. We expect this mix to increase into the upper 70% range by FY '26. This expansion is driven by the growth of subscription-based software with our products and the increased attach of our HPE operational services which rose double-digits in Q4.

The rising software and services mix is expanding our as-a-service margins. Our as-a-service orders grew 11% year-over-year in Q4 and finished the year up a solid 23% after 68% growth in FY '22. Our cumulative as-a-service TCV has now increased to nearly $13 billion. As ARR is now on a clear path to meaningful scale we will simplify our as-a-service disclosure from ARR as-a-service orders in TCV to only ARR in FY ‘24. The explosion in AI demand is driving robust growth in our APU orders. Total APU orders which include APUs in our compute Cray EX and Cray XD businesses totaled $3.6 billion in FY '23 which is up from the over $3 billion we disclosed at SAM 2023. HPE Cray XD APU orders accelerated in Q3 and in Q4 reaching $2.4 billion for the year.

The impressive APU server demand is also evident in our total server demand. APUs represented 25% of total server order dollars in FY '23 up from 10% in the prior year. We will continue to disclose APU orders. However orders can be easily north of $100 million each therefore orders may be lumpy. But the key point is that we are capturing AI demand now and are well positioned for coming demand across the entire AI life cycle from training to tuning to inferencing. Our strategy is delivering top line growth and gross margin expansion. Despite the challenging macro ongoing product digestion and currency headwinds we still produced one of our highest quarterly revenue figures since 2018 while sustaining our expanded gross margin profile. Our Q4 non-GAAP gross margin rose 170 basis points year-over-year to 34.8%.

And our full year non-GAAP gross margin rose 140 basis points to 35.3%. That's a more than 500 basis point improvement from FY '18. Moving to free cash flow. In Q4 we generated $2.8 billion in cash flow from operations and $2.3 billion in free cash flow. Our $2.2 billion in free cash flow in FY '23 was above the high end of our guidance and up meaningfully from $1.8 billion in FY '22 primarily on improved earnings and net income conversion. We exited FY '23 with a cash conversion cycle of negative four days which exceeded our expectation for neutral we communicated at SAM. Strong working capital management in Q4 and reduced transformation costs in FY '23 drove an improvement in our conversion of non-GAAP net earnings to free cash flow to approximately 80% in FY '23.

Continued progress in FY ‘24 and beyond leads us to expect to reach 90% by FY '26. We reiterate our FY ‘24 free cash flow guidance from SAM of $1.9 billion to $2.1 billion. And we returned over $1 billion in capital to shareholders in FY ‘23 including $421 million in share repurchases. While certain price and volume parameters of our trading program limited us to below our $500 million target in FY ‘23 we reiterate our goal of returning 65% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders between FY '24 and FY '26. Before we dive into our outlook let me remind you that we will exclude H3C earnings and gain on sale from our non-GAAP results in FY '24 as we noted at SAM. We continue to expect the process to conclude and the receipt of the cash proceeds in the first-half of calendar 2024.

For Q1 we expect revenues in the range of $6.9 billion to $7.3 billion. This incorporates historical seasonality in our overall business including in the HPC & AI segment after its strong Q4. We expect AI revenue acceleration to drive sequential growth in HPC & AI and total HPE revenue in Q2 '24. We expect GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.24 and $0.32 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS between $0.42 and $0.50. We're reiterating our prior year 2024 guidance of 2% to 4% revenue growth in constant currency. We expect OI&E which as noted excludes HCC going forward to be a headwind of approximately $300 million and our non-GAAP structural tax rate to be 15%. Our full-year GAAP diluted net EPS guidance of $1.81 to $2.01 is $0.02 lower than our prior view as a bit of transformation costs slipped into FY '24.

We are reiterating our full-year non-GAAP diluted net EPS guidance of $1.82 to $2.02. We also reiterate free cash flow guidance of between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. We continue to believe our FY '24 performance will be weighted to the second-half of the year as GPU supply improves. We are increasing our dividend by 8% in FY '24 and intend to return 65% to 75% of free cash flow to shareholders this year. So to conclude while there continues to be unevenness in some areas of the IT market our investment in growing areas of our portfolio is paying off. We are confident in our ability to continue to capture the AI explosion in demand. AI also opens broader customer discussions about the benefits of AI inferencing at the edge and the need to be hybrid by design.

Our HPE GreenLake Cloud platform our AI native portfolio and our services expertise are perfectly aligned to the needs of our customers that we believe will turn into profitable growth for our shareholders. Now let's open it up for questions.

The market was expecting more after Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices Inc (NASDAQ: AMD) gave a glimmer of hope that recovery is picking up just in head of the holidays. Its results mirror PC market trends its rival HP Inc (NYSE: HPQ) reflected when it guided for a weaker-than-expected first-quarter profit due to a slow PC market recovery and weak demand in China. Upon the report Dell shares went down 4% after the bell.

Third Quarter Highlights

Revenue for the quarter ended on November 3rd Dell reported sequentially flat revenue that dropped 12% YoY to $22.25 billion with earnings of $1.01 billion. Operating income amounted to nearly $1.5 million while non-GAAP operating income amounted to $2 billion. With a profit of $1.36 per share adjusted earnings amounted to $1.88 per share.

Dell’s client solutions group that is home to its consumer and enterprise PC business reported revenue dropped 11% YoY to $12.28 billion. However servers and networking business revenue reported a sequential revenue rise of 9% sequentially on the back of fueled interest in genAI.

PC Market Recovery Is Picking Up But Slowly...

Last month research firm Gartner reported that Dell posted a six consecutive decline in PC shipments from July to September due to weak spending by its essential enterprise customer base that resulted from a sluggish economy. According to the research firm global third quarter PC shipments declined 9% with Dell ranking third behind Lenovo Group Limited (OTC: LNVGY) and HP but coming ahead of Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). Another research firm Canalys provided an optimistic outlook of PC market thriving on the back of AI boost. Canalys expects the adoption of AI-powered PCs to accelerate from 2025 onwards with these revolutionary devices making about 60% of all PCs shipped by 2027. Over the next two weeks AMD and Intel will be unveiling their new AI offerings and developments that threaten to trip the AI chip powerhouse Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA). Although Nvidia powered the generative AI revolution with its power chips this market is still in its infancy and AMD and Intel are working hard to catch up. Although Nvidia posted a stellar quarter even the AI chip leader was cautious with its sales guidance that missed lofty numbers that are being whispered throughout Wall Street. With AMD and Intel striking back even Nvidia could trip. Although it is certain that AI will shape the next PC era only time will show exactly how will that look like and if the hype is justified.

Earlier this year a federal judge in Washington state unsealed a whistleblower lawsuit I haven’t been able to stop thinking about. The plaintiff was a nurse practitioner named Maxwell Ollivant who worked from 2019 to 2020 for Optum the physician services subsidiary of the health insurance giant UnitedHealthcare as a primary care practitioner. Ollivant’s patients were nursing home residents insured by a UnitedHealth Medicare Advantage plan. In theory his job was to monitor their symptoms proactively enough to keep them from being admitted to the hospital unnecessarily. In practice many of his patients desperately needed hospitalization: One had a stroke and later gastrointestinal bleeding; another needed a blood transfusion. But Optum bosses according to the lawsuit did everything in their power to stop Ollivant and his colleagues from hospitalizing patients suffering from obvious emergent life-threatening conditions instead directing its employed nurse practitioners to see their “mission” as convincing patients to essentially waive their rights to medical treatment by signing do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders or “comfort care” agreements.

On Tuesday the former Cigna executive turned health care whistleblower Wendell Potter broke the news that his former employer was planning a merger with HMO giant Humana which would create an insurance behemoth with nearly $300 billion in revenue in 2023. Both Cigna and Humana have been under fire recently for alleged efforts to deny reimbursement claims for routine and often urgent medical care. A ProPublica/Capitol Forum investigation earlier this year revealed Cigna was using an algorithm called PXDX to illegally issue blanket denials on hundreds of thousands of claims that would have previously been reviewed by physicians (and in all likelihood approved). Similarly Humana has been under congressional scrutiny over its massive “prior authorization” bureaucracy which requires doctors to obtain up-front permission to treat its Medicare Advantage customers at a rate of 2.8 times per patient per year  the second-highest in the business.

At UnitedHealth which employs or contracts exclusively with 90000 physicians and untold thousands of physician assistants and nurse practitioners like Ollivant bosses can skirt the messiness of prior authorization and denial and the attendant litigation and regulatory scrutiny involved by simply pressuring its clinical workforce to deny care out of the gate. Such are the perks of “vertical integration” through which the country’s largest insurer has turned itself into a one-stop walled garden for health care and increasingly for its denial.

It’s a brilliant business model . UnitedHealth is now the fifth-biggest company in America by revenue with operating income approaching $25 billion and a market capitalization of a half-trillion dollars largely on the strong growth of its Optum medical empire and the one-stop shop for Medicare Advantage patients they serve. And it’s also pretty obviously what Cigna and Humana are hoping to replicate with their merger so long as antitrust authorities don’t get in the way. The two companies are likely betting that whatever resistance Biden’s DOJ exercises to the deal will be undone by a future Trump administration.

THE LAST TIME CIGNA AND HUMANA ATTEMPTED to pull off insurance mega-mergers eight years ago it wasn’t with each other. Cigna proposed to merge with Anthem and Humana with Aetna. In response the Obama Justice Department leaned on UnitedHealth to hand over a large trove of competitive information  which it deployed to successfully argue that the mergers would stifle competition and cause premiums to rise. The mergers were successfully blocked.

In the aftermath Cigna and Aetna agreed to merge with pharmacy benefit managers instead (Express Scripts and CVS Caremark respectively) while Humana teamed up with two private equity firms to buy the then-sprawling senior care empire Kindred Healthcare which Humana had cofounded and spun off decades earlier. The goal of all the transactions was vertical integration. As the business of selling health insurance policies to corporations was perceived as mature and competitive insurers figured they could maximize their profits by insourcing the most profitable segments of the health care supply chain.

This isn’t exactly a new strategy: Humana got its start as a nursing home operator that morphed in the 1980s into an integrated HMO-hospital chain then divested the hospitals to Rick Scott’s Columbia Hospital Corp. in the 1990s and former Cigna executive Robert Patricelli told the Chicago Tribune way back in 1985 that “moving up the ‘food chain’ [of patient services] into ownership of ambulatory care facilities and down in the other direction into ownership of after-care programs” was the “key to survival” in the insurance business.

But positions on the health care food chain are constantly shifting in response to market dynamics and regulator crackdowns. In 2018 Cigna bet big on morphing into a pharma middleman—much it’s worth noting to the chagrin of shareholder Carl Icahn who predicted that its “ridiculous” $67 billion purchase of Express Scripts would go down as one of “the worst acquisitions in corporate history” once the federal government eradicated the PBM business. Humana for its part focused on acquiring assets that would complement its booming Medicare Advantage business.

Regulators displayed little resistance as UnitedHealth rolled up the biggest medical empire of them all.

But only UnitedHealth had the foresight to do something insurance companies had never really done: use its leverage as a dominant payor to thousands of hospitals and medical practices to buy out the practices outright. The move was counterintuitive since individual doctors—especially primary care physicians—have perhaps never sunk as low as they are today on the proverbial “food chain.” But UnitedHealth bought practices primarily as a means of convincing their patients to enroll in their Medicare Advantage plans. Numerous whistleblower lawsuits have alleged that the mechanics by which UnitedHealth induced patients to sign on to its MA plans were illegal violations of anti-kickback statutes but they have done little to slow the dizzying growth of United’s MA business which now insures nearly 30 percent of the nation’s 30.8 million seniors enrolled in Medicare Advantage.

Since 2011 when Optum bought out a massive 2300-physician practice in Southern California called Monarch HealthCare it has rolled up urgent care clinic and surgery center chains massive independent medical practices in Texas New York Massachusetts and Connecticut and a sprawling (and by many accounts dysfunctional) hospital physician staffing firm that was recently the subject of an investigation by The Oregonian. According to a presentation Optum CEO Amar Desai delivered Wednesday to investors United now employs or is “affiliated” with 90000 physicians close to one-tenth of the active physicians in the nation.

Notably while UnitedHealth was crisscrossing the nation on this frenzied clinic shopping spree its lobbyists and lawyers were positioning the insurance behemoth as a watchdog. The company supplied data along with the expertise of its executive Ted Prospect to researchers who published a series of landmark studies on the billing practices of private equity–owned emergency room staffing agencies EmCare and TeamHealth which became the defining health care policy issue of the 2020 election. The company’s legal battles with private equity–backed medical mega-practices from Radiology Partners to American Renal Associates to U.S. Anesthesia Partners brought much-needed public attention and regulatory scrutiny to the scourge of private equity firms using debt financing to roll up vast numbers of specialized medical practices then using their market dominance to gouge patients defraud insurers and shortchange physicians.

But while regulators began flailing around to respond to private equity’s terrifying conquest of health care they displayed little resistance as UnitedHealth rolled up the biggest medical empire of them all. Sadly UnitedHealth’s own incentives could prove substantially more harmful than what it was fighting against.

Maxwell Ollivant’s lawsuit—which he voluntarily dismissed last week after the DOJ declined to intervene—suggests that once it’s absorbed their patients UnitedHealth may not actually need that many physicians. Over the course of his employment Ollivant barely interacted with a single M.D. according to the lawsuit. (A message left with Ollivant’s parents was not returned.) His supervisor was a nurse practitioner as were all the other primary care providers in the Institutional Special Needs program. His interim director of clinical operations was a nurse practitioner his director of medical clinical operations was a physician assistant and two other people with similar titles who coached him in using “patient-tested language” to convince patients identified by Optum’s “mortality risk assessment tool” to lower their “aggressive expectations of care” and accede to signing DNRs were also nurse practitioners.

There is nothing inherently wrong with deploying nurse practitioners to perform duties traditionally done by physicians of course. But it is culturally more difficult for companies like Optum to bully doctors who have invested seven or eight years of their lives (and a half-million dollars) in medical school into abandoning their medical judgment in favor of a profit-maximizing algorithm and I suspect for that reason Optum deliberately keeps physicians away from their sickest patients. A Washington state emergency physician with whom I shared Ollivant’s lawsuit said that while some of its allegations read to him “like some dystopian movie” other details—like the role of emergency room staffing agency TeamHealth which allegedly maintains an agreement to notify Optum before its employees agree to hospitalize any of its Medicare Advantage patients—struck him as plausible.

COULD A MERGED HUMANA-CIGNA EVER HOPE to rival United’s brilliant dystopian business model? Cigna has failed miserably to gain traction in the Medicare Advantage business in which it claims only a 2 percent market share. Recently Cigna agreed to pay the DOJ $172 million and enter into a Corporate Integrity Agreement to settle a whistleblower suit filed by a vendor alleging the company falsely claimed thousands of its Medicare Advantage recipients had complex and obscure illnesses on the basis of little to no legitimate diagnostic evidence in a bid to game the “risk scoring” system that determines the size of the monthly payment insurers receive for a particular patient. In November it reportedly put its Medicare Advantage business up for sale  possibly to avoid the burden of complying with the settlement. But Cigna is a lobbying juggernaut that has successfully fended off meaningful PBM reform despite overwhelming bipartisan support for the cause of ending PBMs altogether.

Humana on the other hand is the second-biggest Medicare Advantage insurer in the nation and the undisputed heavyweight throughout much of the Sun Belt where state regulations are more lax and cash-starved health systems have always been easier for corporations to boss around. The company also just hired former Optum president James Rechtin as its new CEO. And he probably doesn’t need it but a federal antitrust lawsuit filed against Optum last week by a small California hospital system offers something like an instruction manual for exploiting dominant market share to rule over the medical marketplace.

According to the complaint United in 2021 threatened to impose a unilateral 30 percent rate cut on the hospitals unless it agreed to dismantle its affiliated physician practice and cede all its patients to Optum. When the practice refused to play ball United began steering its Medicare Advantage patients to a for-profit hospital ten miles away causing the hospitals’ volumes to plunge by as much as 80 percent in some specialties. As the biggest Medicare Advantage insurer in Virginia Louisiana Mississippi Alabama Kentucky Arkansas the Carolinas and most enviably Florida Humana could similarly move to monopolize medical care in many of those markets. And conveniently Humana earlier this year announced it would be exiting the commercial insurance business entirely meaning it will have no overlapping business lines with Cigna and thus be unlikely to increase the market concentration as gauged by the Herfindahl-Hirschman index a boon with any federal judge in case the DOJ tries to block the merger.

That said far less aggressive antitrust agencies in past presidencies sharply rejected this very bid to whittle down the small group of major U.S. insurance companies; it doesn’t seem like this far more aggressive group at DOJ would suddenly welcome such consolidation. The market certainly seems to believe that the Biden administration will block the merger; the stocks of both Humana and Cigna plunged after the announcement.

But a former antitrust researcher who briefly worked for UnitedHealth speculated that antitrust regulators might be too preoccupied digging into that insurer—whose acquisition of the hospice and home health care provider Amedisys is the subject of a current antitrust probe—to have the bandwidth to block a Cigna-Humana deal. “Without any particular knowledge of the situation I think they’re hoping the DOJ is so unprepared to tackle UnitedHealth that the combined Cigna/Humana might seem appealing to regulators” he said.

And then there’s the possibility that corporate America is betting on a friendlier Trump antitrust regime to replace Biden’s aggressive enforcers Lina Khan and Jonathan Kanter in 2024. Merger reviews often have very long timelines and it’s very possible that there’s a change of power in Washington before any merger resolution is finalized. That’s something to look for in the coming months: Will CEOs begin to make a bet on a Trumpian restoration by divvying up the economy among themselves?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEyLzAxL2NpZ25hLWh1bWFuYS1tZXJnZXItaGVhbHRoLWNvc3RzLWN2c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A rumored merger would create yet another health care titan,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2023/12/01/cigna-humana-merger-health-costs-cvs on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEyLzAxL2NpZ25hLWh1bWFuYS1tZXJnZXItaGVhbHRoLWNvc3RzLWN2c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXh3ZWxsLmFmLm1pbC9OZXdzL0Rpc3BsYXkvQXJ0aWNsZS8zNjAzNzk0LzQybmQtbWVkaWNhbC1ncm91cC1ob2xkcy1vcGVuLWhvdXNlLWZvci1uZXR3b3JrLW1lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtcHJvdmlkZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,42nd Medical Group holds open house for network mental health providers,"The 42nd Medical Group and Humana Military held a Provider Open House on base to strengthen the relationships with local care providers November 8 2023.

The open house provided the opportunity for the medical group to connect with the more than 30 community providers of mental health services to help them understand the base mission the unique challenges faced by military families and how providers can better assist military members retirees and dependents.

As an ambulatory clinic the 42nd Medical Group offers only limited specialty services. To ensure optimal access to all specialty services Humana Military partners with the Department of Defense to administer the TRICARE health program which coordinates access to network services for beneficiaries.

""The medical group directly supports 11000 enrollees and indirectly supports more than 42000 beneficiaries and retirees here. We know how challenging the health insurance and managed care industry has become and we understand how the complexity can affect network providers” said Arthur James Thornton Jr. 42nd MDG TRICARE liaison. ""We are making every effort to build bonds and partnerships to ensure providers realize the value they bring to the treatment team.""

Access to mental health care in the network is key to supporting the beneficiaries at Maxwell.

“Mental illnesses are among the most common health conditions in the United States and we depend on our network partners to provide care to many of our non-Active Duty beneficiaries” said Maj Valeri Bennett 42nd Medical Group Mental Health flight commander. “This event allowed us to build relationships with our community partners and teach them about Maxwell’s mission.”

“While we often think of healthcare in terms of our physical well-being our ability to maintain our mental health goes a long way in ensuring we can maintain strong relationships and a stable positive outlook on life. The military lifestyle with frequent moves and deployments means that the mental health of our families is also tested. Robust community partnerships ensure our families and other beneficiaries have access to these crucial services leading to a stronger military community” said Lt. Col. Anastasia McKoy 42nd Operational Medical Readiness Squadron commander.

This is the Medical Group’s second open house event this year after a successful pediatrics-focused event in the spring. The medical group will continue using these events to open opportunities for network care for all Maxwell-Gunter beneficiaries.

Braelon Allen battled injuries during his three seasons at Wisconsin but the Fond du Lac native hammered opposing defenses while etching himself in the team's record books.

The former four-star prospect as a safety/linebacker who had been preparing to join the Badgers’ defense until his junior year in high school didn't waste much time before solidifying his role as an offensive star at Wisconsin.

With Allen announcing Tuesday that he'll sit out the Badgers' bowl game after helping them regain Paul Bunyan's Axe from rival Minnesota in the regular-season finale here are seven numbers that demonstrate the impact he made in Madison.

Allen finished his Wisconsin career with an average of 5.9 yards per rushing attempt. That places him fifth all-time among Badgers running backs with at least 1000 career rushing yards. While his average fell short of program legends like Melvin Gordon (7.8 yards per carry) Jonathan Taylor (6.7) and James White (6.2) Allen did top the pre-NFL performances of Montee Ball (5.6) and Corey Clement (5.4).

17

It should come as no surprise to those who've watched Allen since his freshman campaign to see the number 17 on this list but in this case it doesn't have anything to do with his age during his first season with the Badgers. Allen posted 165 yards rushing with two scores against the Gophers on Saturday to notch his 17th career game rushing for at least 100 yards and a touchdown. That's the most such performances for any active running back in a Power Five conference according to the university.

35

Allen averaged one touchdown per game over his career at Wisconsin scoring 35 rushing touchdowns while seeing action in 35 of the Badgers' 38 games over three seasons. Allen's total rushing scores fell just outside the program's top 10 coming in at No. 11 overall behind Clement at No. 10 with 36 career rushing touchdowns. Allen also finished 11th all time in total scores by Badgers running backs despite not catching any touchdown passes.

49

Speaking of his limited contribution to Wisconsin's passing game Allen caught just 49 passes over three seasons. After finishing his freshman season with eight catches for 39 yards Allen posted 13 catches for 104 yards as a sophomore and 28 for 132 yards as a junior. Allen's biggest play in the passing game came last season on 39-yard pickup during the Badgers' 35-24 win over visiting Purdue on Oct. 22 2022.

228

Allen had some stellar outings for the Badgers breaking the century mark 20 times but his highest yardage output came during his 10th game when he tallied 228 yards rushing as Wisconsin beat visiting Nebraska 35-28 on Nov. 20 2021. Allen scored three times for the second straight game while playing in front Gordon — one of his childhood idols who was on hand as the Badgers’ honorary captain for the pregame coin toss. He would reach the end zone three times in a game the following season but the win over the Cornhuskers was Allen's only time reaching the 200-yard plateau in a game.

597

Allen may have played a year less than many of Wisconsin's most prolific running backs but it didn't keep him from earning more touches than most with 597 carries over his three seasons. That number stands as the 11th most carries in program history and Allen's workload becomes even more impressive when matched against other three-year players. Only two former Wisconsin running backs John Clay (629 carries over 37 games from 2008-10) and P.J. Hill (770 carries over 37 games from 2006-08) had more rushing attempts than Allen without playing a fourth season.

3494

The largest and arguably most impressive figure highlighting Allen's place in Wisconsin rushing history is his 3494 career rushing yards. Allen moved to ninth on the Badgers' all-time rushing list in his final game with the program passing Clay (3413 career yards) with 165 yards at Minnesota on Saturday. Hill (3942 career yards) is the only three-year running back ahead of Allen who would've needed 215 yards in the upcoming bowl game to tie Billy Marek (3709 yards from 1972-75) at No. 8 in program history.

Forget Taylor Swift though.

Better comparisons for ""Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé"" might be to ""Captain Marvel"" ""Spider-Man"" ""Ant-Man"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy."" This one is a superhero movie all the way.

There are shiny body-enhancing costumes high-flying stunts constant action robotic creatures high-tech gadgets and a climactic finale of the hero riding on screen atop a sparkling horse. There's even an origin story in ""Renaissance"" — a pretty good one too.

Directed by Beyoncé herself and filmed throughout her 56-show Renaissance Tour — alas there doesn't appear to be any footage from July's date at Huntington Bank Stadium in Minneapolis — the movie is about three-quarters a concert film and one-quarter a behind-the-scenes documentary.

The concert scenes are eye-popping and heart-pounding. Granted making Beyoncé look good on camera is probably as easy a job for a filmmaker as making Nazis look bad but the 42-year-old singer absolutely glows and captivates throughout the film.

On top of her natural charisma she goes through a department store's worth of costume changes in the movie — even including different outfits during the same song. That happens thanks to footage from different cities being spliced together. Those sudden changes are a bit disjointed and lessen the ""live"" aspect of the film but you're often too busy marveling at the alternating outfits to care.

The cameras probably could have stayed squarely aimed at Beyoncé for the whole film and no one would have complained but all the other people and scenery shown on screen make it an even better concert movie.

Those extras include scenes showing off dance rehearsals and the technology behind her hi-fi production and the daunting grunt work of the stage crew assembling the massive show. That stage crew by the way was unusually loaded with women.

Best of all — and this is one quality Bey's movie has over Taylor's — audience members are also prominently featured in all the concert scenes. There might not be a more inspiringly diverse crowd than the Beyhive and seeing those fans having the time of their lives together might be an even more beautiful site than the Queen herself.

As for the origin story old footage is dropped in here and there from Beyoncé's childhood in Houston and her early work as a performer. Even sweeter she gives screen time to two of the big things that inspired her ""Renaissance"" album: The LGBTQ ballroom and drag dance community and her late gay uncle and former co-stylist — Uncle Jonny from her song ""Heated.""

Along with new footage of Beyonce with her three kids and husband — daughter Blue Ivy gets way more screen time than Jay-Z another smart move — the non-concert footage actually does serve to explain what's happening onstage. The scenes with Blue Ivy in particular wind up being some of the most poignant in explaining who and what runs Beyoncé's world.

It's all a lot to cram into one film and ultimately the 2-hour 48-minute run time does seem about a half-hour too much. But hey isn't every superhero movie too long these days?

In times of war investors' thoughts naturally may turn to defense stocks. Continuing wars in Ukraine and Israel and Gaza along with various simmering geopolitical hotspots around the world could mean increased revenues for U.S. defense contractors enhancing the allure of stocks in the aerospace and defense category. Though aerospace and defense funds understandably haven't done well in this year's faltering market some individual stocks have posted substantial gains. And now that the overall market has started moving upward in recent weeks this could be an advantageous time for investors to consider the category. Government sales account for varying amounts of revenues received by aerospace/defense companies — from 100% down to 30% or less in some cases.

Diversified revenue creates a 'sweet spot'

As the label aerospace and defense implies many such companies have civilian business from jetliner manufacturers and airlines so the current boom in commercial aviation is a positive for them. This diversification currently puts them in a sweet spot. Though U.S. defense spending on contractors has been pared back a bit over last couple years some aerospace and defense firms continue to benefit from total contract spending that increased markedly in 2017-2020 from $373.5 billion to $448.9 billion rising with the total defense budget.

U.S. support in what's turning out to be a long war in Ukraine will likely push overall contractor spending higher benefitting aerospace and defense companies. In this era of high-tech warfare when strategic military engagement is more about digital systems and aerial weapons than boots on the ground aerospace and defense companies are advantageously positioned. Lucrative products include fighter jets helicopters parts for them avionics products missile guidance system drones and anti-drone technology and support services.

Lesser-known companies have key market positions

Publicly traded companies in this category with relatively low downside risk (based on various fundamental metrics) and good growth projections include some familiar names of large companies including General Dynamics  Lockheed Martin and Northrup Grumman . Yet standing out from such behemoths are some lesser known and/or smaller companies whose key market positions and robust growth projections may signal greater potential for investors. Among them are these six: TransDigm Group Inc. (TDG) Projected average annual earnings growth over five years according to FactSet: 26%

Market cap: $48 billion (as of mid-November) TransDigm designs and manufactures original aircraft parts for manufacturers and aftermarket replacement parts for operators of commercial and military aircraft. Most of its revenue is from civilian aviation sources. The company is benefiting from the integration of global economies which is spurring jetliner fleet additions and from pricing power as the sole supplier of some items. Though its trailing 12-month price/earnings ratio is high at 47 this multiple has been pushed up by stock price growth of about 15% over the past six months as of mid-November. Parsons Corp. (PSN) Projected five-year annual earnings growth: 13%.

Market cap: $6.5 billion. This global technology company gets most of its revenue from federal agencies both defense and civilian. Parsons Corp. clients include the U.S. Department of Defense the Missile Defense Agency the State Department Department of Homeland Security the Department of Energy and the Federal Aviation Administration. Products and services include items to counter unmanned air systems and gear for national security bio-surveillance space launches border security rail design/control and infrastructure engineering. The stock prices has increased about 36% over the past six months bringing the trailing P/E up to 48.

watch now

Howmet Aerospace (HWM) Projected five-year annual earnings growth: about 22%.

Market cap: nearly $19.9 billion. About 30% of Howmet 's revenue is from defense. This is a manufacturer of lightweight jet-engine components aerospace fastening systems titanium aircraft parts and forged wheels. Its largest customers are commercial aircraft and jet engine manufacturers. Thus this stock has more cyclical risk than more military-intensive companies. However Howmet's EBITDA (earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization) is up 16% this year and order-flow momentum is highly positive. Trailing P/E: 31. Curtiss-Wright Corp (CW) Projected five-year annual earnings growth: Data was not available.

Market cap: about $7.8 billion. CW has the best downside-risk/forward-performance metrics of all aerospace/defense stocks. Curtiss-Wright provides engineered products and services for the defense industrial and global power-generation markets. Most defense companies are located in Virgina (near government clients in Washington) but Curtiss-Wright is headquartered in Davidson N.C. Products include throttle-control devices joysticks transmission shifters sensors and electro-mechanical actuation components used in commercial and military aircraft. Pure defense lines include turret-aiming and stabilization items weapons-handling systems communications gear and naval ship items including airlock hatches and products for spent-nuclear-fuel management and propulsion parts. CW also provides services for ship repair and maintenance. Despite a stock price increase of more than 20% over the last six months solid earnings have kept this company's trailing P/E under 23. Woodward Inc. (WWD) Projected five-year annual earnings growth: 13.2%.

Market cap: $7.94 billion. Woodward designs and manufactures mechanical control items for aviation and industry both original equipment sold to manufacturers and replacement parts for operators. Products include fuel pumps metering units valves nozzles motors and sensors. Woodward also makes thrust-reversal systems for military aircraft and helicopters and commercial and private civilian aircraft and flight-deck systems for aircraft carriers. Industrial items include products for gas and steam turbines and compressors. This is another non-D.C. area company located in Fort Collins Colorado. Trailing P/E: about 39 with share price growth of more than 18% over the last six months. Huntington Ingalls Industries (HII) Projected annual five-year earnings growth: 24%.

Market cap: $9.3 billion. A pure defense play Huntington Ingalls Industries is primarily a warship company with a focus on aviation as it builds aircraft carriers. More than 82% of its revenue is from the Navy though it also manufactures and services Coast Guard vessels. Long time frames for producing Naval ships may make HII's revenues more predictable. The company's ultimate product is the 1106-foot nuclear-powered aircraft carrier U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford. The latest in carrier technology this ship can support up to 90 aircraft including F-35s and other fighter jets as well as helicopters and unmanned aerial vehichles (aka drones). In the water since 2013 the Ford was the subject of news coverage in October when the Pentagon deployed it to Mediterranean coast off Israel as a deterrent to Iranian involvement in the Israeli-Hamas conflict. The company is currently touting its status as the manufacturer of ""the Gerald R. Ford class"" of carriers. Trailing P/E: 17.7 even with a stock price increase of about 18% over the past six months.

Brian McDonnell head of the global pension practice at Cambridge Associates says there is a growing realization among employers that defined contribution plans are one tool in the “retirement readiness toolkit” but they transfer a considerable amount of risk to participants.

“I think [plan sponsors] are realizing that part of the reason [defined benefit plans] were around for so long … is that dollar for dollar they are actually a relatively affordable way of providing a relatively high level of retirement security to your employees [and] to your beneficiaries” McDonnell says. “There’s more volatility along the way but certainly I think over most longitudinal periods of looking at what it might cost to sponsor versus the benefit provided I do think they look attractive and they are very competitive.”

McDonnell adds that while IBM may have been uniquely positioned to revert to its cash balance plan as the company’s plan frozen in 2006 is likely now overfunded many more firms may also be in the position of having an overfunded plan as a result of discount rate changes and high interest rates.

John Lowell a partner at October Three Consulting said in a recent webinar hosted by Callan that IBM likely applied the surplus from its frozen plan toward some of its future cash balance accruals.

In addition to reopening the cash balance plan IBM is ending its 5% DC matching contributions and 1% automatic contributions to employees’ 401(k) accounts in favor of an automatic 5% retirement benefit provided to all employees.

“IBM is far from alone in having an overfunded pension plan” McDonnell says. “They’re now in a position to look around and creatively say ‘What are the next steps for our retirement benefit?’”

McDonnell says the mindset of DB plan sponsors over the last 10 to 15 years has likely been focused on terminating the plan and decreasing liability to be least costly to the company. While the percentage of workers covered by a traditional DB plan has been steadily declining over the past 25 years McDonnell argues that there is a compelling case for plan sponsors to reevaluate the benefits these plans can offer.

“I think advice for [plan sponsors] would be to look at [their] defined contribution plan and [ask] ‘How much is it costing per year to remain competitive in the marketplace for talent?’” McDonnell says. “If [they] haven’t thought about [their] defined benefit plan in the past 10 to 15 years other than through this decreasing-of-risk lens [they should] make sure that [they’re] educated around what tools are available for the pension plan today.”

For liability and hedging McDonnell says plan sponsors can think of creative ways to use a certain amount of plan assets to insulate the overall funded status of a plan. Employers can also consider growth assets in which the plan can invest beyond just stocks such as private equity private credit and other diversifying hedge fund-like strategies he argues.

“I think there are a lot of ways to still provide a growth rate that provides an attractive benefit while smoothing the ride along the way” McDonnell says.

In addition McDonnell says the benefit of a cash balance plan for participants is that it typically involves a vesting period of for example five years of service after which a participant’s balance would maintain ownership of their balance whether working at that company or elsewhere.

“You don’t have to work for the company for 20 years” McDonnell says. “Once you accrue [a balance] it is your benefit that will keep growing. More money won’t necessarily be put into it on your behalf if you’re no longer working for the company but you … can accrue a pretty meaningful cash balance.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW0uaWVlZS5vcmcvcXVhbnR1bS1lcnJvci1jb3JyZWN0aW9uLWlibdIBRWh0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW0uaWVlZS5vcmcvYW1wL3F1YW50dW0tZXJyb3ItY29ycmVjdGlvbi1pYm0tMjY2NjM4OTg0Mw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IBM Offers Quantum Error Suppression Out Of The Box,Edd Gent is a freelance science and technology writer based in Bengaluru India.

Code Engine offers apps jobs and (recently function) that you can (or need) to pick from. In this post we provide some discussion points and share tips and tricks on how to work with Code Engine functions.

IBM Cloud Code Engine is a fully managed serverless platform to (not only) run your containerized workloads. It has evolved a lot since March 2021 when I published the blog post “Migrating Cloud Functions Code to Code Engine.” In 2021 there were only Code Engine apps and jobs. Earlier this year Code Engine added support for functions (Functions-as-a-Service or FaaS).

In this post I am going to take a fresh look at that topic and discuss the options on how to move from IBM Cloud Functions to Code Engine.

Utilize Code Engine environment variables.

Apps jobs and functions

IBM Cloud Code Engine features three different ways to run your business logic:

An app is a continuously run process that answers to HTTP requests.

is a continuously run process that answers to HTTP requests. A job runs to handle a task and then terminates.

runs to handle a task and then terminates. A function is a stateless code snippet that is invoked by an HTTP request and after producing a response terminates. Moreover jobs usually run significantly longer than functions (“batch processing”).

There are many more characteristics that help distinguish between apps jobs and functions. In short apps are a good fit if you want to craft a REST API or deploy a web application with backend/frontend functionality. You have full control over the HTTP server and its resources.

Jobs on the other hand are long-running processes that do not require any user interaction. They could be typical batch activities analytics processing or even AI model training.

Lastly functions can react to incoming HTTP requests very quickly. They serve low-latency use cases well like chatbot integrations or webhooks. In contrast to apps you do not and cannot define and configure the HTTP server.

When coming from Cloud Functions you may have experienced that there are many use cases supported by Cloud Functions. Similarly a function may have different attributes that are important depending on the case:

The invocation or start-up time (cold start) might be important leading to an overall short response time.

In other cases the cost (billing) might have been the competitive factor.

The simplicity and agility caused by a function as unit for development and deployment in a DevSecOps process leads some projects to opt for functions.

Often it is a combination of the above that leads to people preferring functions (FaaS) over other runtime or compute options.

From Cloud Functions to Code Engine

When moving from Cloud Functions to Code Engine the following function characteristics need to be taken into account when deciding to on an app a job or a Code Engine function:

Is an http endpoint needed to invoke the code?

Is the processing triggered by an event?

What programming language is used for the existing function and how big are the required libraries?

How long does the processing take what compute resources are needed is parallel processing desired?

The guide Migrating IBM Cloud Functions to Code Engine has a detailed overview with Code Engine app job and function characteristics. They help you to select the best entity for your existing workload. Additionally the current Code Engine function limitations and the general limits and quotas for Code Engine need to be taken into account. The section Migrating IBM Cloud Functions Actions to Code Engine Functions FAQ might help you decide how to migrate.

Tips and tricks for Code Engine functions

The following tips and tricks are based on my experiences with moving existing code from Cloud Functions to Code Engine functions. They help in cutting down deployment cycles by first utilizing local tests to implement similar functionality in combining Code Engine functions and jobs and designing integrated APIs by making use of Code Engine system variables.

Local testing of functions

Apps are regular web applications jobs are like scripts and both can be tested locally in several ways. Because functions are code snippets some wrapper is needed to turn them into programs. The following approach has served me well so far.

With the function code in a subdirectory “func” I utilize either the Python or Node.js wrapper code shown below and place it in the parent directory. There I also maintain files with test configurations as JSON objects similar to what is passed by Code Engine to the function on invocation. For testing I run the wrapper along with the configuration file as parameter. The wrappers for Python and Node.js are shown below:

# syntax: python wrapper.py params.json # import the Code Engine function: func/__main__.py from func.__main__ import main import sys json if __name__ == ""__main__"": # open file read JSON config with open(str(sys.argv[1])) as confFile: params=json.load(confFile) # invoke the CE function and print the result print(main(params))

// syntax: node wrapper.js params.json // require the Code Engine function: func/main.js var func=require('./func/main.js') // read the file with function parameters const fs = require(""fs""); const data = fs.readFileSync(process.argv[2]); // invoke the CE function and log the result console.log(func.main(JSON.parse(data)));

Job-like functions

Sometimes you might need the HTTP endpoint of a function and the possibly longer execution time of a job. In that case create both a function and a job. Then utilize the Code Engine API to create a job run from within the function. In this hybrid approach the function can get called via its HTTP endpoint and it terminates after kicking off the job run. A job could then run up to 24 hours and benefit from the parallel job processing capabilities in Code Engine. You can find a sample implementation of this pattern in the Code Engine code examples.

Environment variables and API design

For designing your API and functions namespace you can utilize Code Engine-injected environment variables like __ce_path and __ce_method . The former holds the path component of the requested URL like “/object” and the latter has the HTTP method like GET or POST. By switching on the supplied values for these variables you can serve multiple API functions from the same Code Engine function. The benefit is a single base URL.

Depending on your project and code management you might even want to combine this approach with separating each API function implementation into its own file—similar to the wrapper approach shown above.

Conclusions

IBM Cloud Functions have many use cases and properties so there is no straightforward mapping to a specific Code Engine entity (i.e. app job or function). By comparing an existing (Cloud Functions) function’s attribute to those of the Code Engine entities you can pick the best fit. In many cases a Code Engine function might be a good choice. For these cases we shared tips and tricks that you can use for your Functions-as-a-Service project with Code Engine.

This year marks the 175th anniversary of International Harvester’s first factory in Chicago and the 150th anniversary of its legendary McCormick Works which was called “the world’s largest farm machine factory.”

For more than 100 years the company was synonymous with manufacturing in the Windy City. Its factories mass-produced millions of threshers tillers tractors and other products that were used by generations of farmers.



Humble Beginnings

After inventing a mechanical reaper in Virginia in the early 1830s Cyrus McCormick set up manufacturing operations in Chicago in the late 1840s to be closer to his customer base of prairie farmers. At the time Chicago was a small town with a population of only 20000.

McCormick secured financial backing from William Ogden the first mayor of Chicago who also built the city’s first railroad the Galena & Chicago Union. McCormick’s younger brother Leander was put in charge of running the fledgling operation.

The company’s first factory was located on the north bank of the main branch of the Chicago River near where the DuSable Bridge crosses Michigan Avenue today in the fashionable Streeterville neighborhood.

The two-story wood-sided building was 100 feet long by 30 feet wide. It featured a 10-horsepower stationary steam engine for driving machinery such as lathes planers and saws. Inside carpenters made wooden frames while other workers forged hammered drilled and riveted metal parts by hand. Within a year the McCormick Reaper and Mower Works employed 33 men including 10 blacksmiths who produced 450 machines.

The McCormick brothers ended up being in the right place at the right time. During the small factory’s first full year of production in 1848 several other momentous events occurred in Chicago. The Galena & Chicago Union began operating; the Illinois & Michigan (I&M) Canal opened linking Lake Michigan with the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers; and the first telegraph line between Chicago and New York City went into operation.

Within two years McCormick was producing 1400 machines annually. A few years later the factory was lengthened from 100 to 190 feet. The company also installed a 30-horsepower steam engine and added a rail spur. Soon more than 200 employees were turning out 40 machines per day and the company occupied more than 100000 square feet of floor space.

The McCormick Reaper Works was considered to be a modern marvel. In the early 1850s the Chicago Daily Journal newspaper profusely described its operation this way:

“An angry whirr a dronish hum a prolonged whistle a shrill buzz and a panting breath—such is the music of the place. You enter—little wheels of steel attached to horizontal upright and oblique shafts are on every hand…Rude pieces of wood [arrive] upon little railways as if drawn thither by some mysterious attraction. [The lathes] touch them and presto grooved scalloped rounded on they go…The saw and the cylinder are the genii of the establishment. They work its wonders and accomplish its drudgery…Below glistering like a knight in armor the engine of 40 horse power works…silently…shafts plunge cylinders revolve bellows heave iron is twisted into screws like wax and saws dash off at the rate of 40 rounds a second.”

Despite that gushing praise McCormick’s early production techniques were somewhat backward and primitive. The company relied heavily on artisanal craft methods and traditional tools used by blacksmiths.

“Leander’s reliance on cast iron and cast malleable iron dictated against the use of drop-forging equipment one of the hallmarks of New England armory practice” says David Hounshell author of From the American System to Mass Production 1800-1932. “Not until the early 1880s is there any mention of drop-forging at the McCormick works.

“McCormick’s machinery [was] entirely different from the highly specialized machine tools that characterize New England armories and the American system of manufacturing” adds Hounshell. “Virtually absent [was] a rigorous gauging system whereby every critical dimension is checked. Completely absent [was] a rational jig and fixture system.”

To keep up with demand and boost productivity the McCormick brothers regularly enlarged and improved their factory which was designed with ready access to water and rail transportation so that mass production could easily tap into mass distribution. The facility was built to control costs and was strategically situated between docks on the Chicago River for receiving raw materials such as lumber and railroad tracks for shipping finished products.

McCormick originally relied on suppliers in New England for parts such as blades and sickles but it gradually developed a network of local Chicago firms for metal castings and other components. In 1849 the company estimated its manufacturing cost to be $55 per machine. However as McCormick grew in size it became more centralized and vertically integrated.

By 1859 when reaper production surpassed 5000 units annually the factory was operating five woodworking shops and a foundry.

Eventually McCormick expanded beyond reapers to include other horse-drawn farm implements such as corn and wheat binders hay and grass rakes and sickle mowers. Most of the devices were made from hundreds of metal and wood parts.

Iron and steel were used for components such as axles cutting blades gears shafts and wheels for durability. Chassis frames and bodies were made out of wood which was readily available in Chicago’s burgeoning lumber district.

To generate demand for its products McCormick pioneered a variety of sales and marketing techniques such as advertising paying on credit and try-before-you-buy tactics. The company also waged a series of drawn-out patent wars with competitors.

The McCormick Reaper and Mower Works was the largest factory in Chicago by 1868. That year the facility turned out more than 9500 machines. Business continued to boom until October 1871 when disaster struck. After a long dry summer and fall Chicago became engulfed in a wild fire that destroyed large swaths of the city including the reaper works.



Bigger and Better But Bitter

After the fire the McCormick Works was built on the Southwest Side of Chicago in the Canalport neighborhood near the eastern terminus of the I&M Canal. When it opened in 1873 the facility was bigger and better than ever. It featured five-story brick buildings and a 300-horsepower steam engine. The 23-acre complex eventually grew into a huge facility covering more than 150 acres with numerous buildings that employed thousands of people.

Because of the new facility McCormick Harvesting Machinery Co.’s production doubled between 1870 and 1880. By 1879 the company was producing 18000 machines a year at an average cost of $29 each. But production techniques remained rather primitive.

“Until about 1880 the McCormick Works in Chicago depended primarily upon blacksmiths skilled machinists and skilled woodworkers to build its reapers” says Hounshell. “From the beginning of the business Cyrus McCormick’s younger brother Leander was responsible for the production of the reaper.

Until the early 1880s McCormick relied heavily on artisanal craft methods and traditional tools used by blacksmiths. Illustration courtesy Wisconsin Historical Society

“Leander whose only experience had been as a country blacksmith from Rockbridge County VA operated the reaper works as though it were a large country blacksmith shop” explains Hounshell. “Rarely did he draw upon the stock knowledge about large-scale manufacture that had developed in New England and even more rarely did he use the special tools devised there or the New England concepts of specialization of machine tools.”

Leander was eventually ousted from the company in 1880 after a bitter fight with his older brother (according to some historians he was jealous of all the praise and attention that Cyrus received as being “the father of modern agriculture” and the person “having done more for agriculture than any living man.”). He was replaced by an engineer who previously worked at the Colt gun factory and the Wilson Sewing Machine Co. in Connecticut.

Lewis Wilkinson convinced upper management that drastic changes in the factory were necessary including the importance of part interchangeability and standardization based on a system of models jigs fixtures and gauges.

“This event brought an end to the blacksmith-machine shop-carpenter shop approach to reaper manufacture and signaled the beginning of production under the American system of manufactures” claims Hounshell.

Wilkinson made numerous changes such as adding a night shift at the McCormick Works to boost productivity and bringing more order and discipline to the factory floor. “For the first time in the company’s records the words ‘gauges’ ‘pattern machines’ and ‘jigs’ consistently appear” says Hounshell.

However all of those changes were not popular with workers which lead to labor unrest and instability.

“Without question there were certain costs to…the institution of a new system of manufacture” notes Hounshell. “Labor problems ranked foremost. The net result of the changes initiated by Wilkinson…was that the company gained increasing control of work processes from skilled workmen….This series of changes in approach to production between 1880 and 1894 which offered a sharp break from the past played a fundamental role in the ‘prelude to Haymarket.’”

In 1880 Cyrus McCormick died and his son Cyrus Jr. took over management of the company. During the next four years the factory became more mechanized and annual production volume rose dramatically from 21555 machines to 54841 units.

“McCormick City” as it was referred to by some locals employed 1400 workers by 1884. The complex also became more vertically integrated producing nearly every part used in its machines including cotter pins nuts and bolts.

Labor unrest reached a boiling point in 1884 as workers staged a bitter strike. Two years later the company installed new pneumatic molding machinery to replace skilled iron molders and their powerful union. However the machines produced poor quality castings and led to a labor revolt including several strikes.

On May 3 1886 a long-simmering strike at the McCormick Works erupted in violence. Police used brutal tactics to defend non-union workers from attacks by strikers as they left the factory. Unfortunately they fired on the crowd killing several people.

That incident led to a large protest rally the next evening in Haymarket Square on the West Side of Chicago. Someone in the mob which included anarchists and socialists threw a home-made bomb that killed eight police officers and injured 60. An undetermined number of bystanders were also killed or injured.

Manufacturing Marvel

After many labor issues were resolved the McCormick Works thrived in the late 19th century. The success of the operation also attracted other farm implement manufacturers to Chicago such as William Deering who eventually set up a huge reaper works of his own along the north branch of the Chicago River. In 1902 Deering merged his company with McCormick and several other rivals to form International Harvester Co.

An article in the September 1915 issue of The Harvester World a company magazine for employees described the McCormick Works as “126 acres of land in the heart of Chicago covered by five-story factory buildings electric power stations forges and foundries…alive with…flying belts whirling pulleys giant wheels and thundering drop hammers. Imagine all this city of steel fire and thunder beating rhythmically with a giant unity and you have a faint picture of the largest farming machine factory on earth.”

By 1920 the McCormick Works was bigger and better than ever. Its 160 acres of multistory buildings were the equivalent of “a one-story building 25-feet wide and 30 miles long” boasted a visitor guidebook from the period that contained 76 pages describing the inner workings of the facility.

“It is now the oldest and largest harvesting machine plant in the world” claimed the publication. “Neither words nor photographs can fully represent so vast an aggregation of factories foundries and workshops. Driven by seven great engines operated by 7000 employees this immense industrial mechanism packs 14000 freight cars with its finished product in a single year.”

In addition to a huge foundry machine shops and assembly lines one of the most impressive features of the McCormick Works was a twine mill that occupied 500000 square feet and produced 30000 tons of material per year. Workers processed it completely from raw fiber into packages of balled twine that was used with wheat binders and other types of farm equipment.

The company eventually became even more vertically integrated. It owned a steel mill on the Southeast Side of Chicago coal mines in Kentucky iron ore mines in Minnesota and forests and sawmills in Missouri. Raw materials were transported by a fleet of ships and several short-line railroads owned by the company.

Vertical integration enabled the company to boast in the mid-1920s that “mowers [will emerge from the factory] three hours and thirty minutes after the pouring of the molds in the foundry.”

To increase throughput the McCormick Works adopted production techniques that were pioneered in the auto industry. For instance it implemented “progressive assembly” processes to make binder frames. The complex also featured a variety of chutes slides and conveyors that processed and fed the 3800 parts needed to assemble a binder.

“You cannot take a dozen steps in the McCormick Works without coming upon some one of the countless huge ungainly looking machines that do their work with the nicety and precision of a high-priced watch” proclaimed an article in the June 1917 edition of The Harvester World.

“At the McCormick Works wherever machines can be made to do the work as well or better and more speedily than men they are used. Where the work is such that it must be done by hand every effort is made to systemize it and eliminate unnecessary steps.

“Progressive frame assembly is carried on within small circular tracks laid on the floor surrounding a space 30 feet in diameter. Each track is covered with small trucks waist high. Binder frames in their very beginning start at one point on this track moving along growing step by step to come off as finished frames when they have completed the circuit.

“The men work inside the circle each one having a certain part to attach. Each man takes the part from a truckload which always stands at hand assembles it and pushes the truck on to the next man. The last man on the circuit hangs the frame up to be carried away by an overhead trolley.”



Tractors and Torpedoes

In the early 1900s engineers at International Harvester began experimenting with internal combustion engines. The company’s first line of tractors appeared in 1908. Its big breakthrough the Titan helped usher in a new era in agriculture.

To meet growing demand a Tractor Works was constructed next to the McCormick Works. More than $1 million was invested in the state-of-the-art facility which even included a test track. By 1910 half of the 4000 gasoline-powered tractors built in the U.S. rolled out of the complex.

A decade later the 49-acre Tractor Works comprised 17 buildings and 850000 square feet of production space. And productivity soared after engineers installed a moving assembly line.

“One-at-a-time days gone at Tractor Works” proclaimed an article in the May 1923 issue of The Harvester World. “Upon the completion a short time ago of the installation of several hundred thousand dollars’ worth of new equipment…of 507-foot and 250-foot progressive assembly conveyor chains and of numerous other innovations and adaptations of personnel and equipment Tractor Works is entering upon another major period of progress in tractor manufacture.

“Every operation every inspection every movement consumes the least time at the least cost without sacrifice of quality or uniformity. Progressive assembly and quantity production in the full sense of the latest engineering practice now entitle Tractor Works to rank among the leaders in this type of quality-quantity manufacturing.”

By the end of the 1920s those investments paid off. International Harvester produced 60 percent of the tractors built in the U.S. including the popular Farmall and McCormick-Deering brands.

An article in the October 1930 issue of The Harvester World described the Tractor Works as a modern marvel of manufacturing. “[After engines are assembled and tested they] finally are lined up to feed the main tractor assembling line. Further along transmission and drive gears which have been developed in a large department of their own are put into position and so on with the other components.

“The massive tractor main frame milled by rotary cutters and drilled and tapped in a remarkable machine operated by one man is the first part hoisted on to the slowly moving assembly track. As it proceeds its components are added to it in order by men who are experts in their particular fitting operations so that each part literally slides into its prescribed location without the smallest hitch.

“When the endless chain conveyor gets as far as the tunnel-like paint booth the tractor is complete except for its wheels. It enters the booth paint is sprayed on by compressed air and when it emerges the separately painted wheels are fitted. The complete tractor then makes a journey through the 35 yards of the drying tunnel at the end of which it receives the ‘pipe tobacco and matches’ of locomotion—petrol oil and water.

“When it is just ready to roll off the production line the engine is started up and as soon as the wheels make traction with the floor the machine is driven away under its own power.”

During World War II the McCormick Works assembled thousands of aerial torpedoes for the U.S. Navy. Photo courtesy Wisconsin Historical Society

During World War II both the Tractor Works and McCormick Works played key roles in the “arsenal of democracy.” The former mass-produced military bulldozers for the U.S. Army while the later made Mark XIII aerial torpedoes for the U.S. Navy.

Each torpedo weighed more than 2000 pounds and was 13 feet long and 22 inches in diameter.

“The torpedo is unlike anything [we have ever] manufactured before” claimed at article in the July 1943 issue of The Harvester World. “We never have built any product where the tolerances throughout are as close as in the torpedo. Indeed few products ever have been built by mass production methods where the precision required was so great.

“The torpedo work is as fine as the finest watch or compass. It would be difficult to name any product in which there are so many small delicate parts which must be machined and finished to such infinite tolerances and adjusted to such close fittings. There are in excess of 1000 parts in the torpedo. In the production of those parts Harvester employees perform between 15000 and 20000 individual separate operations.

“It was realized from the first that many women would have to be used for torpedo work both because women are being called upon to perform more war jobs and because they are more adaptable to many of the operations on the small delicate parts that go in the torpedo.

“Some of the most difficult jobs in torpedo production are the assembly jobs on small parts. Here the problems are very similar to the assembly of a tiny wrist watch calling for patience precision and individual skill. Much of this sort of work must be done under a magnifying glass.

“There are parts where the accuracy must be maintained to 25 ten-thousands of an inch. Some parts are sorted within a limit of 25-millionths of an inch. There are parts which fit so snugly that a particle of dust on them will destroy the accuracy required.”



End of an Era

After World War II International Harvester began to rest on its laurels and failed to keep up with changing market conditions. After a century at the top it lost the coveted No. 1 market share of the farm machinery industry to Deere in 1958 and never recovered.

In 1959 IH decided to close the legendary McCormick Works. An article in the April 19 1959 issue of the Chicago Tribune said that “a number of trends in agriculture and the farm equipment market plus the age and condition of the plant buildings prompted the decision….At the same time the average size of farms has grown creating a need for larger implements. Buildings at the McCormick Works are not suited to production of these bigger units.”

At the time 3800 people were employed at the facility which consisted of 53 buildings spread over 104 acres. Implements made at the site included corn cotton and potato planters; seeders; fertilizer distributors; field harvesters; harrows; and rotary hoes.

“McCormick Works had sprung up during the era of animal-powered faming” explained an article in the June 1961 issue of The Harvester World. “The wooden horse-drawn implements for which it had been designed were doomed with the coming of the tractor.

“In more recent decades the trend toward fewer and larger farms has produced another major change: a swing from single- and two-row implements to eight-row. McCormick’s multistory mill-type buildings were not suited to production of the heavier machines.”

“This plant was the wonder of its day but manufacturing concepts have changed” lamented Mark Keeler vice president of the farm equipment division at International Harvester (IH). “Five-story buildings just don’t lend themselves to efficient production methods.

“A lot of our floors wouldn’t support forklift trucks. Materials had to be hand-trucked into warehouses out of warehouses into boxcars. There was a constant movement of little two-wheel hand trucks into elevators up five floors and back down. And most of the elevators—we had 38—were steam powered and slow.

“Modern material handling was out of the question. We tried everything in our power to keep the plant going but the odds were too great.

In the early 1920s International Harvester adopted moving assembly lines from the auto industry to mass-produce farm tractors. Photo courtesy Wisconsin Historical Society

“Unfortunately the changing nature of the farm implement business and the physical problems of McCormick Works left us no choice. We couldn’t afford to manufacture in an obsolete and high-cost factory like McCormick Works when we have more efficient space at other plants.”

Production was shifted to newer one-story IH facilities in Canton OH; East Moline IL; Hamilton ON; Memphis TN; and Waukesha WI.

Demolition work took several years to complete with the project wrapping up in April 1962. However production continued throughout the decade at the Tractor Works next door. After World War II the facility had stopped producing wheeled row-crop machines and specialized in crawler tractors. By the late 1960s it had become an “obsolete and uneconomic plant” and fell victim to a cost-cutting initiative.

By the time the last machine rolled off the line in 1969 the Tractor Works had assembled more than 3 million vehicles. Production was moved to newer one-story IH facilities in the Chicago suburbs of Libertyville and Melrose Park IL.

During the next decade the grand dame of Chicago manufacturing experienced a downward spiral withering away until finally succumbing to changing business conditions in the wake of a bitter strike in the late 1970s. Remarkably a member of the McCormick family (Brooks McCormick the great grandnephew of Cyrus) was still running the company up until 1980.

The IH construction equipment division was sold to Dresser Industries Inc. in 1982 and the agricultural machinery division was sold to Tenneco Inc. in 1985. The medium- and heavy-duty truck division (created in 1917) was spun off into Navistar International Corp. (acquired by Volkswagen AG’s Traton division in 2021).

Today the IH name lives on as part of the Case IH division of CNH Industrial which was acquired by the forerunner of Stellantis in 1999. The McCormick name was resurrected in 2000 for a popular line of farm tractors that are currently made by an Italian company called ARGO.

The IH tractors and implements that once rolled out of the company’s large factories in Chicago are now highly prized by collectors. Many have been restored to like-new condition and are a popular site at country fairs and vintage vehicle shows.

Diagnostics giant Illumina could seek an outright sale of Grail a cancer detection test manufacturer.

In an interview on 28 November with Evercore ISI Illumina’s CFO Joydeep Goswami revealed that the company plans to file a Form 10 by the end of this year which will allow Illumina to “engage with others who have an interest in grail either through […] a sponsorship and a spend solution or an outright sale”.

Grail has been a thorn in Illumina’s side since the latter acquired it in 2021 in contravention of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and European Commission which has since required the company to be divested. The news that there is outside interest first reported by Endpoints News could help the firm recover some of the credibility that has been lost through a series of legal battles over the past two years.

If Illumina is not able to successfully appeal the divesture order which appears unlikely given the way in which the European Commission responded to Illumina’s initial move it will have to get rid of Grail by October 2024. Goswami downplayed potential scepticism by the market over an asset that has cost the company so much telling his interviewer that “there is interest in what Grail brings to the market what Grail brings in its leadership in the MCED space” though was careful to caveat that he didn’t want to jump the gun on an announcement.

Class action

Illumina’s fortunes are not looking up yet though. Already facing down a lawsuit by activist investor Carl Icahn over the deal three separate law firms encouraged investors to join the suit as lead plaintiffs on 28 November. The firms – Pomerantz LLP Portnoy Law and Bronstein Gewirtz & Grossman – all specialise in class actions on behalf of investors.

This is likely to increase the pressure on Illumina; whether or not these firms are successful in growing the suit the fact that they are putting the call out means that they believe the case has a reasonable chance of success.

Announced last year a five-story 400000-square-foot office and lab building was planned by the biopharmaceutical company to be its fourth building at the Augustine Cut-Off headquarters campus in Wilmington’s Alapocas suburb and be home to upward of 1200 employees.

In a small line in its third quarter Securities and Exchange Commission filing Incyte informed investors that the “closing conditions had not been met and we no longer expect the purchase to move forward.” The company is writing off $5.6 million in expenses related to the failed deal.

The filing was made on Oct. 31 but first reported by Delaware Business Now on Friday.

On Tuesday the company confirmed that its plans for the Friends School campus were dead saying in a statement “Incyte terminated the contract with [Wilmington Friends School] because the New Castle County Board of Adjustments denied the necessary approval of variances which were critical to our ability to move forward with our site plan. We are exploring other options to buy or build additional space in Delaware.”

Reached in October 2019 the sales agreement between Incyte and the Friends School totaled $50 million and figured into the private school’s ability to afford expansion and renovation of its main campus.

Friends aimed to use the proceeds of the sale to consolidate all of its grades into one campus something it hasn’t been able to do since the 1970s when the school acquired the 20-acre Lower School property.

The Lower School campus which houses the school’s pre-K to fifth grade programs off Edgewood Road is located about a quarter mile away from the main campus off Alapocas Drive. The lower school also sits directly adjacent to Incyte’s headquarters the old Wanamaker Building off Augustine Cut-off which it purchased for nearly $80 million in 2016.

The deal had already survived a lawsuit by a neighboring homeowners association that was won in the Court of Chancery but it faced the reality of a difficult hearing for a rezoning of 12 of its acres.

For months neighbors have submitted opposition to New Castle County’s Planning Board voicing concerns over the traffic noise and light pollution potential of the five-story structure and its associated 1200 employees.

After continued outcry last month the county reportedly dropped its plans to include the property in a comprehensive rezoning bill that would have included it with a dozen other properties for a hearing rather on its own.

It’s unclear whether Incyte was still interested in pursuing the project at that point in time though having told investors that it was no longer anticipating buying the land as of Sept. 30.

It’s a blow for Incyte a biopharma company that has become a billion-dollar darling of Delaware that employs hundreds here and 2000 around the globe. It has already fully developed its existing land at its headquarters campus but retains leased space in Chadds Ford Pa. that it had hoped to consolidate to Delaware.

“We want them here in Delaware because this is our home” Incyte Executive Vice President of Human Resources Paula Swain told state planning officials last year. “And so this space will allow us to not only do that but have sufficient growth for the future. We continue to discover and develop drugs and this will really allow us to have a very long runway here.”

Incyte develops drugs primarily in oncology and hematology treatment but much of the company’s success can be pointed to Jakafi its blockbuster small-molecule drug that is used in the treatment of rare bone marrow cancer blood diseases and in certain bone marrow donations.

In the past two years Incyte has won approval for Opzelura a topical cream version of Jakafi to treat eczema and vitiligo. It led to a major investment by Incyte into its inflammatory and dermatological markets.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This new technology is used to ensure an even arrangement of parts in the build space during nesting.

The new nesting function of the renowned 4D_Additive software from CoreTechnologie uses artificial intelligence (AI) for the first time to automate intelligent behavior and machine learning. The new technology simulates certain human decision-making structures based on the programming and by this means the computer independently processes complex tasks in the area of so called nesting.

Optimized Component Nesting

With its new “pack and optimize” strategy the nesting module of the latest 4D_Additive software version is able to ensure both maximum filling of the installation space and even distribution of the mass to be printed thus ensuring the most constant possible slice surfaces. The advanced program uses AI technology and imitates the behavior of an experienced user by automatically filling empty areas in the packaging space after pre-positioning. This has the advantage that even build spaces that are not fully loaded are filled evenly and without so-called heat nests. The printing results are maximally optimized by the even distribution of the components.

Intelligent Additional Functions

In addition to intelligent nesting further functions are available to optimize heat distribution within the components. An analysis to determine so-called massive zones shows problematic areas with large material volumes and displayes these zones graphically in a highly visible manner. These zones then can be hollowed out with a few mouse clicks using the hollow and lattice functions and if necessary reinforced with an internal support structure. To remove powder from the inside of the hollowed parts holes and the appropriate lids can be created automatically.

For the preparation of 3D printing data the 4D_Additive tool has CAD data interfaces for all B-Rep native and standard formats as well as the common 3D printing formats such as STL and 3mf.

Further information on the new 4D_Additive software version is available here.

INTC,Intel,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAyL2ludGVsLXNjb3Jlcy1hLXdpbi13aXRoLWVyaWNzc29uLW5ldHdvcmtpbmctY2hpcHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Scores a Manufacturing Win With Ericsson Networking Chips,"The Intel 4 manufacturing process makes a surprise appearance.

Chip giant Intel (INTC 0.79%) is investing billions of dollars in building its own foundry business. The real payoff won't come until 2025 at the earliest when its Intel 18A process node expected by Intel to be the best in the industry enters full-scale production. In addition to the Intel 18A process the company's foundry arm advertises the cost-effective Intel 16 process for chips that don't need cutting-edge manufacturing tech as well as the upcoming Intel 3 process.

Intel Foundry doesn't appear to offer the Intel 4 process as an option. Intel 4 will be used to manufacture the company's own Meteor Lake laptop chips which are set to launch in December but nothing else on Intel's PC or server roadmaps make use of the process.

It turns out that at least one other product is using Intel 4. Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson announced in November that its latest family of radio-access network chips which are used by communications-service providers are manufactured using the Intel 4 process. It's unclear whether this was a true design win for Intel Foundry given that Intel 4 doesn't seem to be on the menu or if Intel was involved in the design process. Either way it's a win for Intel's manufacturing ambitions.

Just the beginning

While the news that Ericsson was using the Intel 4 process for its RAN chips was a surprise the two companies struck a deal earlier this year to manufacture future Ericsson chips using the Intel 18A process. Under the agreement Intel will manufacture future 5G SoCs for Ericsson using the Intel 18A process and the two companies will collaborate to optimize Intel's latest Xeon server central processing units (CPUs) for Ericsson's Cloud RAN solutions.

The Intel 4 process which the company used to refer to as its 7nm process will be the first from Intel that uses extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography a technology capable of printing much smaller patterns than previous lithography technologies. Intel 3 will be a refined version of Intel 4 bringing improvements in power efficiency.

The Intel 20A and Intel 18A processes introduce additional innovations. Both processes will feature backside-power delivery which moves the wires that deliver power to the chip below the transistor layer. This approach promises to boost performance on top of the performance gain delivered by shrinking the size of the transistors. Intel will be the first manufacturer to use backside-power delivery when the Intel 20A process is ready in 2024. These two processes will also use a new transistor design called RibbonFET.

Assuming Intel can maintain its roadmap and launch these processes on time the company will be in a great position in 2025 to compete for business from leading chip designers. Ericsson is already on board for the Intel 18A process; Intel and Arm are collaborating to optimize Intel 18A for future Arm-based chips; and Intel has announced three unnamed customers for Intel 18A including one that made a large prepayment.

The Ericsson chips manufactured on Intel 4 may not move the needle for Intel's foundry business but they do represent a vote of confidence in the company's ability to deliver process nodes on time for its customers. The real test will be in 2025 and beyond when Intel 18A and future process technologies go toe-to-toe with foundry market leader TSMC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFjZW50ZXJkeW5hbWljcy5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9pbnRlbHMtZ2F1ZGkzLWFpLWFjY2VsZXJhdG9ycy13aWxsLWhhdmUtdHdvLXBoYXNlLWxpcXVpZC1jb29saW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel's Gaudi3 AI accelerators will have two-phase liquid cooling,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/intels-gaudi3-ai-accelerators-will-have-two-phase-liquid-cooling/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhdGFjZW50ZXJkeW5hbWljcy5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9pbnRlbHMtZ2F1ZGkzLWFpLWFjY2VsZXJhdG9ycy13aWxsLWhhdmUtdHdvLXBoYXNlLWxpcXVpZC1jb29saW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEyLzAxL2ludGVsLWhwZS1wcmlvcml0aXplLXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LXByb2Nlc3Nvci1kZXNpZ24tbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1ocGVkaXNjb3Zlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel and HPE prioritize sustainability in processor design and manufacturing,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://siliconangle.com/2023/12/01/intel-hpe-prioritize-sustainability-processor-design-manufacturing-hpediscover/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vc2lsaWNvbmFuZ2xlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEyLzAxL2ludGVsLWhwZS1wcmlvcml0aXplLXN1c3RhaW5hYmlsaXR5LXByb2Nlc3Nvci1kZXNpZ24tbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy1ocGVkaXNjb3Zlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlbHMtbmFzZGFxLWludGMtaW52ZXN0b3JzLXBsZWFzZWQtMTMwMDMxMzE4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel's (NASDAQ:INTC) investors will be pleased with their notable 56% return over the last year,"Passive investing in index funds can generate returns that roughly match the overall market. But one can do better than that by picking better than average stocks (as part of a diversified portfolio). To wit the Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) share price is 52% higher than it was a year ago much better than the market return of around 11% (not including dividends) in the same period. If it can keep that out-performance up over the long term investors will do very well! In contrast the longer term returns are negative since the share price is 14% lower than it was three years ago.

With that in mind it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance or if there are some discrepancies.

Check out our latest analysis for Intel

There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.

Over the last twelve months Intel went from profitable to unprofitable. While some may see this as temporary we're a skeptical bunch and so we're a little surprised to see the share price go up. We might get a clue to explain the share price move by looking to other metrics.

We doubt the modest 1.1% dividend yield is doing much to support the share price. Unfortunately Intel's fell 24% over twelve months. So the fundamental metrics don't provide an obvious explanation for the share price gain.

The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).

It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on Intel

What About Dividends?

As well as measuring the share price return investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Intel the TSR over the last 1 year was 56% which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!

Story continues

A Different Perspective

We're pleased to report that Intel shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 56% over one year. That's including the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 2% over half a decade implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario this may hint at some real business momentum implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Intel better we need to consider many other factors. Even so be aware that Intel is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis  you should know about...

Why Are These the Best Dividend Stocks?

We use forward dividend yield as the metric for the top 10 dividend stocks listed on the NYSE or Nasdaq. Investors prioritizing dividends are looking for a steady income stream alongside the potential for stock price appreciation. However future dividends are not a given even for companies with a good track record. Some considerations to keep in mind:

Dividends are adjusted: During moments of economic uncertainty a company may reduce or cut its dividend payments altogether to preserve capital to weather storms previewed ahead. Alternatively companies may increase their dividend payments in a bullish economic environment to attract investors.

Changes in the percentage yield: These stocks may offer a lower dividend yield when facing different overall market conditions changes in financial stability and adjustments to their market value.

Some dividend yields can mislead: Some dividend-paying companies may increase their dividend yield to attract investors in the short term though higher dividends can be unsustainable. That is why it's important to pay close attention to a company's payout ratio.

How to Pick Dividend Stocks

Investors should pursue companies with robust fundamentals long-term profitability and a sustainable dividend yield that has consistently increased for some years.

How to Find Dividend Stocks

When reviewing dividend-paying companies it is notable that certain sectors such as finance energy and real estate investment trusts typically pay higher dividends than other industries. When picking the right company investors should also pay attention to a company's peers to determine if a dividend yield is out of the ordinary for the sector.

What Should Investors Look For in Dividend Stocks?

Dividend yield: The dividend yield reflects the annual value of dividends received relative to a security's per-share market value. You can calculate this by dividing the annual dividend per share by the current stock price though most brokerage platforms and financial news sites publish such information.

For example if Company ABC issues a dividend of $10 annually with a current share price of $100 it has a dividend yield of 10% ($10 / $100 = 10%). Investors pursuing high-yielding stocks can start by screening for issues with a divided yield above a certain percentage. Keep in mind that dividend yield is only one of many metrics to consider before investing.

Dividend payout ratio (DPR): The DPR gauges how much of a company's earnings are paid to shareholders. Investors calculate the ratio by dividing total dividends by net income. This too can be found on financial sites and other platforms.

For instance if Company ABC reports a net income of $50000 and pays $15000 in annual dividends it would have a DPR of 30% ($15000 / $50000 = 30%). That is the company pays 30% of its earnings to shareholders. Typically a company that issues less than 50% of its net earnings in dividends is considered stable and has the potential for sustainable long-term earnings growth.

Dividend coverage ratio: This measures the number of times a company can pay dividends to its shareholders. Investors calculate the dividend coverage ratio by dividing a company's annual earnings per share by its annual dividend per share.

For example if Company ABC reported $10 million in net income with an annual dividend of $2 million to shareholders it has a dividend coverage ratio of five ($10 million / $2 million). Usually investors see a higher dividend coverage ratio as more favorable.

The Bottom Line

Investors pursuing dividend-paying companies should pay close attention to the overall financial condition of the stock they are planning to invest in. A company may offer a high dividend yield even when financially unstable and it's important not to invest without a proper understanding of the underlying stock.

It is essential to maintain a consistent strategy when going the dividend-payment route. There are advantages including passive income for choosing companies that issue dividends and provide a steady stream of income. Another great aspect of dividend investing is reinvesting dividends paid out by a company using them to buy more shares and taking advantage of compounding returns.

destruction or degradation of basic services infrastructure.

GENEVA (ILO News) – Climate change is multiplying the incidence of child labour particularly in agriculture where 70 per cent of all child labour is found according to a new paper by the International Labour Organization (ILO).The Issue paper on child labour and climate change  is being released as delegates gather to discuss climate action at the COP28 Climate Change Conference and during the 14th annual meeting of the ILO Child Labour Platform (CLP) the leading business initiative to eradicate child labour in supply chains. The paper finds that climate change – and the public and private sector responses to it – is having a profound impact on child labour and on progress towards the 2025 target date for ending all forms of child labour set in the Sustainable Development Goals.Children have been identified as one of the population groups at greatest risk from the systemic shocks caused by climate change. The issue paper analyses existing research and identifies some of the key channels through which climate change and climate change responses are linked to child labour.It finds that increased poverty is probably the most important link between climate change and child labour. The damage caused by climate change is significantly affecting livelihoods and living conditions pushing more people into poverty and degrading the circumstances of those who are already poor and vulnerable. There is evidence that these conditions induce households to rely more on child labour the paper says.Other key impact channels identified in the paper include:The issue paper also finds that policy responses can have an important impact on child labour and there is an urgent need to take child labour into consideration when planning public and private actions to support climate-neutral economies and societies. Above all this means ensuring that climate action is structured to further child labour reduction goals and does not have unintended negative consequences.The paper highlights important implications for future public and private climate actions particularly as the impact of climate change grows and intensifies. For example public climate change adaptation policies such as environmentally sustainable methods to intensify agriculture production or public works schemes to buffer climate shocks must be designed to reduce household dependence on child labour rather than creating greater demand for it.For businesses which face both environmental and human rights challenges it means ensuring that environmental and human rights priorities are reasonably aligned and mutually reinforcing.The issue paper was launched at the CLP annual meeting in Geneva with a discussion between business leaders on the emerging challenges and opportunities for action across regions and supply chains . The paper will also be presented at the ILO Just Transition Pavilion  at the 28th session of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28) taking place in Dubai United Arab Emirates.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5rZXppLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsL2dhcmJhZ2UtcmF0ZXMtY291bGQtaW5jcmVhc2UtaWYtY291bnR5LWNvbW1pc3Npb25lcnMtYXBwcm92ZS1uZXctd2FzdGUtZmFjaWxpdHkvYXJ0aWNsZV9lZjk3ZDFkYy05MDllLTExZWUtYjVlMC0zMzY3M2E1MTBjZjEuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garbage rates could increase if county commissioners approve new waste facility,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

“Lowlands is a shining example of how South Carolina does conservation so well” commented Dale Threatt-Taylor TNC's executive director in South Carolina. “The family gets to keep ownership of their land while our business and conservation communities and the state invest in protecting its natural resources. Those resources—including clean drinking water—benefit us all.”

The Hampton County property known as Lowlands remains family-owned and will continue to be managed for forestry wildlife and recreational uses on the uplands. A permanent buffer of bottomland hardwoods along more than two miles of Long Branch Creek has been set aside and will never be harvested to ensure water quality in the Savannah River.

“The Lowlands conservation easement is part of a visionary watershed protection effort in the South Lowcountry. Simply stated it’s much less expensive to take proactive natural measures to maintain good water quality than it is to treat unclean water” commented Dr. David Bishop coastal and midlands conservation director. “The protection of this property contributes to a complex of nearly 130000 acres of protected land along the Savannah River made possible in part by the Savannah River Clean Water Fund. This is the fourth easement the Elliott family has done with TNC in recent years which is a remarkable commitment to conservation in South Carolina.”

The Savannah River Clean Water Fund established in 2014 brings together landowners five water utilities and industry from two states to conserve forests for the benefits they provide to drinking water local economies and wildlife. International Paper (IP) was the first private sector company to join the fund and provided a financial contribution to secure this conservation easement.

“Healthy forests are the heart of our stewardship values at International Paper” commented Sophie Beckham vice president and chief sustainability officer at IP. “We are proud of our partnership with TNC in supporting the Savannah River Clean Water Fund which will have a real impact on healthy and productive ecosystems within our communities.”

The South Carolina Conservation Bank has contributed $44682605 to 93 land protection projects in the Savannah River Basin and made a major grant to secure this conservation easement. “Lowlands and the adjoining privately-owned protected properties provide public benefits well beyond their boundaries” remarked Raleigh West director South Carolina Conservation Bank. “The Nature Conservancy’s ability to work at such a significant scale is to the benefit of the residents of Savannah Hilton Head Beaufort and the communities in between.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wb3N0c3Rhci9uYW1lL3dpbmlmb3JkLW1pbGxpbmd0b24tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NTM3NTQ4MTjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Winiford Millington Obituary (1941 - 2023) - Corinth NY - Post-Star,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/poststar/name/winiford-millington-obituary?id=53754818 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9wb3N0c3Rhci9uYW1lL3dpbmlmb3JkLW1pbGxpbmd0b24tb2JpdHVhcnk_aWQ9NTM3NTQ4MTjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Joining the Intuit Expert Network changed all that.

Anisha Wells wants to make a difference in this world for her family—and for just about everyone else she knows and meets. She developed a real passion for helping and serving others in her previous roles as a daycare director and property manager. However Anisha’s unpredictable work schedule often left her with little to no work-life balance as she juggled her demanding personal and professional commitments.

“My family is my everything so I needed to find a role in a more supportive work environment with the flexibility to give more time to my children. There just wasn’t enough of me to go around.”

So Anisha eventually gave up her job to search for a new opportunity where she could thrive in her career and at home.

She found an ideal fit with the Intuit Expert Network.

How Intuit provides additional opportunities for growing a tax career

As a TurboTax Live Tax Prep Assistant Anisha combines her tax experience with her passion for making a difference in people’s lives. She also has the flexible and supportive environment she was longing for so she can support her family’s needs.

“I can now be where I need to be to help the people I care about in both my personal and professional circles—that is something that’s just unmatched in any other job I’ve ever had” Anisha said. Equally as important Anisha appreciates the supportive team environment the Intuit Expert Network offers. “There are so many training opportunities and programs to become an Enrolled Agent or advance your tax knowledge so that you can move into different roles within TurboTax.”

Today Anisha’s career with Intuit is flourishing. She’s recently applied for a management role where she can use her people skills and passion for supporting others. “People can be very emotionally driven and I feel like one of my biggest strengths is my ability to connect with someone guide them comfort them and let them know we’re going to get through this together.”

Intuit’s team culture promotes collaboration and support

Anisha has built a strong support network by working across multiple teams in the many pilot programs Intuit introduces to find ways to solve important customer problems. “Our daily team huddles give us an opportunity to get to know each other and build relationships.” If Anisha has a question about how to solve a customer problem she can call a colleague for help knowing she can reciprocate at any time. “Even though we’ve never met in person we’ve been able to form friendships thanks to the way Intuit sets up the network.”

Anisha is grateful she embraced the opportunity to become a TurboTax Live Tax Prep Assistant. “Intuit always reminds us—we’ve got your back and we’re here for you.” The ability to collaborate with her managers and her co-workers makes all the difference for her.

As part of a community of experts who share best practices and with access to tools and educational opportunities it’s no wonder Intuit Experts like Anisha feel supported!

Intuit Inc. beats earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $2.47 expectations were $1.98.

Operator: Good afternoon my name is Chelsea and I will be your conference operator. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to Intuit's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2024 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions]. With that I'll turn the call over to Kim Watkins Intuit's Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Watkins?

Kim Watkins: Thanks Chelsea. Good afternoon and welcome to Intuit's first quarter fiscal 2024 conference call. I'm here with Intuit's CEO Sasan Goodarzi and our CFO Sandeep Aujla. Before we start I'd like to remind everyone that our remarks will include forward-looking statements. There are a number of factors that could cause Intuit's results to differ materially from our expectations. You can learn more about these risks in the press release we issued earlier this afternoon our Form 10-K for fiscal 2023 and our other SEC filings. All of those documents are available on the Investor Relations page of Intuit's website at intuit.com. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Some of the numbers in these remarks are presented on a non-GAAP basis.

We’ve reconciled the comparable GAAP and non-GAAP numbers in today's press release. Unless otherwise noted all growth rates refer to the current period versus the comparable prior-year period and the business metrics and associated growth rates refer to worldwide business metrics. A copy of our prepared remarks and supplemental financial information will be available on our website after this call ends. And with that I will turn the call over to Sasan.

Sasan Goodarzi: Thanks Kim and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We had a very strong first quarter and have great momentum innovating on our platform across the company. Total revenue grew 15% driven by Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue growth of 18% and Consumer Group revenue growth of 25%. This was partially offset by Credit Karma revenue decline of 5% in line with our expectations for Q1 given the macroeconomic environment. With the strong start to the year we are reiterating our full year guidance for fiscal year 2024. Consumer Group revenue growth reflects a strong finish to the tax extension season. We remain focused on transforming the assisted consumer and business tax categories with TurboTax Live.

Story continues

Our innovation in tax has accelerated in several areas. First the Credit Karma platform is leveraging data and AI to deliver personalized experiences and compelling tax offers. Second is the innovation with TurboTax Live to deliver speed and confidence to prior year assisted customers particularly with full service where we can get taxes done in as little as an hour using data AI and our expert platform at scale. And third Intuit Assist our GenAI-powered financial assistance helping customers in key areas where confidence matters most. For example understanding their refund or getting answers to their questions as if they're talking to an expert. We ran many experiments during the extension season and the learnings give us confidence in our game plan to win this tax season.

We believe this is Intuit's most exciting era yet. Five years ago we declared our strategy to be an AI-driven expert platform with data and AI core to fueling innovation across our platform. We're delivering experiences where the hard work is done for you with a gateway to human expertise powering our customers' prosperity and accelerating penetration of our $300 billion in TAM. The launch of Intuit Assist is the result of years of investment in data and AI. At the core of our platform is powerful relevant data. Intuit has incredibly rich longitudinal transactional and behavioral data for our 100 million customers. We have 500000 customer and financial attributes per small business and 60000 financial and tax attributes per consumer on our platform.

And with our GenAI operating system GenOS we empower Intuit technologists to create breakthrough AI experiences across the platform. This includes utilizing our own powerful financial LLM as well as those from other leaders in GenAI which together unlock new opportunities to serve our customers with accuracy and speed in a cost-efficient way. We are creating a future of done for you a future where the hard work is done automatically on behalf of our customers with a gateway to human expertise fueling their financial success. Intuit Assist powered by GenAI is critical to delivering unparalleled benefits for our customers over the next decade. Let me share a few updates on Intuit Assist across our offerings. First Mailchimp. We're rolling out two new GenAI experiences designed to help our customers grow their revenue and save time.

These include AI-driven audience segmentation and marketing automation. I'll share more on those in just a moment. Second TurboTax. As I shared earlier during the extension season we tested new GenAI experiences to deliver higher confidence for our DIY customers. This includes in-topic accuracy checks and personalized explanations throughout the filing process that help explain a customer's tax outcome. We're excited about rolling out these experiences this season. Third QuickBooks. We are testing GenAI to help customers save time and run their business with complete confidence including a digital expert that can surface business insights and allow customers to dig deeper or connect them to a human expert. For example we're serving our proactive business insights to customers with an actionable business summary.

These customers are using the business summary as a launching point to learn create reports directly using Intuit Assist and take actions to drive their business success. These experiences will be rolled out in the coming months and in the future we plan to automate these actions and do the work for our customers. Fourth Credit Karma. We're testing GenAI to help our customers find the products that are right for them in a highly personalized way. For example based on our research prime members spend an average of five hours online comparing credit card benefits. With our members' credit data and spending history from accounts they choose to link to Credit Karma we can use GenAI to help members select the right credit card for them optimized based on their personal spending history.

This is designed to increase engagement with our members and help them improve their financial health and drive financial success. These experiences will be rolled out in the coming months. We are excited by Intuit Assist's early progress. It will change our relationship with customers as we move from a transactional workflow platform to a trusted assistant that our customers rely on daily to power their prosperity. We believe Intuit Assist will lead to higher frequency of engagement and monetization across the platform. Let me now highlight progress across two of our five big bets. As a reminder our five big bets are revolutionize speed to benefit connect people to experts unlock smart money decisions be the center of small business growth and disrupt the small business mid-market.

Our fourth big bet is to become the center of small business growth by helping our customers get new customers get paid fast manage capital and pay employees with confidence in an omnichannel world. In payments our innovation continues to drive digitization from creating an estimate to invoicing a customer to getting paid to paying a supplier. Today easier discovery auto-enable payments instant deposit and get paid upfront are all helping drive adoption of our payments offering. Total online payment volume growth was strong in the quarter at 21%. We're also making good progress digitizing B2B payments to accelerate and automate transactions between small businesses and ultimately improving their cash flow. We made our bill pay offering widely available to customers during the quarter.

While it's early we are seeing mid-market customers choosing the paid subscription offering at approximately 2x the rate of non mid-market customers indicating this paid offering is resonating with larger customers. Turning to Mailchimp. We are well on our way to becoming the source of truth for our customers to help them grow and run their business. As I shared earlier we're rolling out several features powered by Intuit Assist in time for peak holiday season for many of our customers. Let me highlight two of these impactful benefits designed to help our customers grow their revenue while saving time. First AI-driven audience segmentation which allows small businesses to target specific audiences. Many customers don't use audience segmentation today despite the fact that it can drive up to 60% lift in average order revenue or average order value over 12 months.

With Intuit Assist a customer can use conversational language to more quickly build segments and use them as a part of a marketing campaign. Second AI-powered marketing automation which are automated workflows that help small businesses reach their customers in uniquely tailored way. Today many of our customers don't use marketing automation because they are time consuming the setup even though they can help them drive higher revenue. With Intuit Assist Mailchimp creates marketing automation which can easily be turned on and e-mail content can be generated and edited. Our fifth big bet is to disrupt the small business mid-market representing a TAM of 1.7 million customers 800000 of which are already in our franchise but using a core QBO or desktop product.

Online mid-market customer and revenue growth remained strong and we are driving increased adoption of QuickBooks Advanced payments and payroll resulting in ARPC expansion as we serve these mid-market customers with a full ecosystem of services. We are proud of our innovation and the impact that we're making on our customers' lives. We also continue to make an impact on the communities that we serve. This quarter we launched Intuit for education a new financial literacy program to provide Gen Z and Gen Alpha students access to Intuit products and teach some personal and small business finance skills. We also announced the first set of winners of our Coalfield Solar Fund providing grants in [Seven-Eye] (ph) solar energy projects in coal mining communities to help build a sustainable future.

Wrapping up with our durable AI-driven expert platform strategy and focus on innovating with GenAI across our platform we are more excited than ever about the opportunity in front of us and our ability to power prosperity for our customers. We are also delighted to be one of the only eight Fortune 500 companies named to Fortune's inaugural top 50 AI Innovators list. With that let me now hand it over to Sandeep.

Sandeep Aujla: Thank you Sasan. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024 we delivered very strong results that exceeded the high end of our guidance range across all key metrics including revenue of $3 billion up 15%. GAAP operating income of $307 million versus $76 million last year. Non-GAAP operating income of $960 million versus $662 million last year up 45% GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.85 versus $0.14 a year ago and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.47 versus $1.66 last year up 49%. I am pleased with our early momentum this fiscal year. Turning to the business segment. Small Business and Self-Employed Group revenue grew 18% during the quarter driven by online ecosystem which grew 20%. Our results demonstrate the power of our small business platform and the mission-critical nature of our offerings which continue to resonate with customers as they look to grow their businesses and improve cash flow in any economic environment.

with the goal of being the source of truth for small businesses our strategic focus within a Small Business and Self-employed group is threefold grow the core connect the ecosystem and expand globally. First we continue to focus on growing the core. QuickBooks Online’s accounting revenue grew 19% in Q1 driven mainly by customer growth higher effective prices and mix shift. Second we continue to focus on connecting the ecosystem. Online services revenue grew 20% in Q1 driven primarily by Payroll Mailchimp Payments Capital and Time Tracking. Within Payroll revenue growth in the quarter reflects an increase in customers adopting the payroll solutions and a mix shift towards higher-end offerings. In Mailchimp revenue growth was driven by higher effective prices and paying customer growth.

And within Payments revenue growth in the quarter reflects ongoing customer growth as more customers adopt our payments offerings to manage their cash flow as well as an increase in total payment volume per customer. Third we continue to make progress expanding globally by executing a refreshed international strategy which includes leading with both QuickBooks Online and Mailchimp in established markets and leading with Mailchimp in all other markets as we continue to execute on a localized product and lineup approach. On a constant currency basis total international online ecosystem revenue grew 16%. Desktop ecosystem revenue grew 14% in the first quarter and QuickBooks Desktop Enterprise revenue grew in the high single digits. We are more than two-thirds of the way through a three-year transition for customers that remain on our license-based desktop offering to a recurring subscription model.

In conjunction with our business model transition we also raised prices across multiple desktop products in October consistent with our principle to price for value. Looking ahead we expect continued strong desktop ecosystem to revenue growth this year as we complete the remaining part of the three-year transition. Our focus is to continue innovating across our online ecosystem and to help our desktop customers migrate seamlessly to our online offerings. We continue to expect the online ecosystem to be a growth catalyst longer term. Moving to Credit Karma. Credit Karma delivered revenue of $405 million in Q1 down 5% year-over-year. We saw partners taking a conservative approach to extending credit in both personal loans and credit cards during Q1.

We -- This performance was consistent with our expectations and a prudent approach to guidance given the uncertain macroeconomic environment. On a product basis the decline in Q1 was driven primarily by macroeconomic trends across personal loan auto insurance home loans and auto loans partially offset by growth in credit cards and Credit Karma money. Shifting to the consumer and ProTax groups. Consumer Group revenue was $187 million and grew 25% in the quarter and ProTax revenue was $42 million and grew 24%. During the quarter we saw stronger-than-expected TurboTax return volume from states both with and without extended tax deadlines and strong performance in share of total returns during extension season. As Sasan shared earlier we are excited about our innovation across TurboTax.

The multiple experiments we ran during the extension season bolster our confidence in our game plan to win this coming tax season. Now let me briefly touch on our financial principles and capital allocation. Our financial principles guide our decisions that remain our long-term commitment and are unchanged. We finished the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion in cash and investments and $5.9 billion in debt on our balance sheet. In September we raised $4 billion in secured -- sorry in senior notes to repay the outstanding balance on an unsecured term loan. These notes carry a weighted average coupon of 5.29% approximately 1 point lower than the term loan rate at the end of Q4. As a reminder during Q1 we made tax payments of approximately $710 million that were deferred from fiscal 2023 due to the IRS disaster area tax relief.

We also repurchased $603 million of stock during the first quarter. Depending on market conditions and other factors our aim is to be in the market each quarter. And lastly the Board approved a quarterly dividend of $0.90 per share payable on January 18 2024. This represents a 15% increase versus last year. As I stated earlier I'm pleased with the early momentum we're seeing in fiscal 2024 highlighting the strength of our platform within the uncertain macroeconomic environment that is consistent with our expectations. We have a proven playbook and a track record of managing for the short and the long term including controlling discretionary spend to deliver strong results while investing in what is most important for future growth. Our goal remains for Intuit to emerge from this period of macroeconomic uncertainty in an even greater position of strength.

Moving on to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2024 guidance. This includes total company revenue growth of 11% to 12% GAAP operating income growth of 15% to 18% non-GAAP operating income growth of 12% to 14% GAAP earnings per share growth of 11% to 15% and non-GAAP earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%. Our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2024 includes revenue growth of 11% to 12% GAAP earnings per share of $0.62 to $0.68 and non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.25 to $2.31. As a reminder we are taking a prudent approach with guidance given the continued macroeconomic uncertainty. You can find our full fiscal 2024 and Q2 guidance details in our press release and on our fact sheet. With that I'll turn it back over to Sasan.

Sasan Goodarzi: All right. Well thank you Sandeep. And to wrap it up we are confident in our AI-driven expert platform strategy and progress across our five big bets and creating a future of done for you with a gateway to human expertise. We believe this will change our relationship with customers becoming their trusted adviser leading to higher engagement and monetization. The combination of our assets and our strategy creates a growth flywheel for Intuit to accelerate at penetrating our $300 billion in TAM. With all of that said let's now open it up to your questions.

Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Your line is open.

According to a study two-thirds of Americans say the inflationary state of the economy now makes them anxious about their finances. Gen Z and millennials are most likely to report feelings of financial anxiety (71%).

More than a quarter of Americans (27%) “doom spend” to cope with stress according to the study conducted by Qualtrics on behalf of Intuit Credit Karma.

As reported by CNBC three in four Gen Zers say they would rather live in the moment than save for that rainy day.

Reprieve for a doom spender

Dave and Debbie speak with KSL NewsRadio Producer Alexie Zollinger about her experience with doom spending.

Living paycheck to paycheck Zollinger said said she works two jobs and for all of last month she worked seven days a week. Feeling overwhelmed and exhausted doom spending gives her a moment of release from stress she explained.

“I’m really tired. I’m working all the time. I don’t know what I’m working for. I’m not gonna be able to buy a house. I can’t afford to take on debt to go to college to pursue more education. It does feel a little bit hopeless” Zollinger said.

Zollinger spend her money on “small things.”

“I have a problem with thrift shopping because it’s cheap; it’s affordable. And it fulfills that little tiny little desire for some sort of reward for all of your hard work” she said.

She added that saving money is unrealistic given the fact that the median price for a home in Utah is over $500000.

“Housing is almost unreal. It’s like an impossible vision for people my age” Zollinger said.

But she said she didn’t want Gen Zers to be linked to doom spending. It’s reckless impulsive spending regardless of age she stressed.

“To me it’s the result of trying to fill this hopeless void that you have about your future. And I think the problem should be addressing that before shaming anybody for doom spending” Zollinger said.

December 1 2023

Financial concerns are causing considerable stress for Americans and a portion of them are trying to alleviate these worries through increased spending. Intuit Credit Karma’s report reveals that over a quarter of the U.S. population is partaking in “doom spending” as a response to their anxieties about the overall economy and international events. This report is based on a survey of over 1000 adults conducted in November.

“Much like doom scrolling we’re seeing people mindlessly shop to soothe concerns about the economy and foreign affairs which could take a toll on their financial well being.” Courtney Alev consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma via Business Insider

The advent of mobile shopping has made doom spending as straightforward as doomscrolling with mobile purchases accounting for nearly $5.3 billion of the total Black Friday sales revenue. Survey respondents voiced major concerns about the inflation rate which has seen the Consumer Price Index rise by 3.2% from the previous year in October escalating living costs unaffordable housing and insufficient funds for even essential needs or minor luxuries.

Younger generations are most affected by this trend with 35% of Generation Z and 43% of millennials admitting to doom spending. The younger populace is especially worried about the potential impact of harsh economic conditions on their future earnings job stability and the ability to secure high-paying jobs as highlighted in the report.

The increase in doom spending is also occurring as Americans are rapidly dipping into their savings accumulated during the pandemic. Simultaneously credit card debt has skyrocketed to an all-time high this year inching close to $1.1 trillion in the third quarter of 2023.

In August 2021 excess savings peaked at $2.1 trillion but dropped drastically to $148 billion in September marking a loss of over 90% in just two years. According to the report by Credit Karma almost half of Americans have seen a reduction in their savings in the last six months and more than half report having less than $2000 or no savings at all.

Despite the looming threat of a recession the surge in consumer spending has supported economic stability in recent months. However experts anticipate that this spending boost may start to taper off next year.

Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan echoed other experts’ concerns about consumer spending cautioning in September that current spending patterns have been excessively high and that it’s erroneous to assume that a robust consumer sector today guarantees a flourishing economic environment for years to come."

The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one delivering an average surprise of 3.03%.

Let’s delve deeper.

Strength in Robotics: We are upbeat about Intuitive Surgical’s robot-based da Vinci surgical system that enables minimally-invasive surgery and reduces the trauma associated with open surgery. The da Vinci System is powered by robotic technology that has provided the company with solid exposure to medical mechatronics robotics and AI for the healthcare space.

On ISRG’s third-quarter 2023 earnings call the installed base of the da Vinci system grew approximately 13% year over year. The utilization of clinical systems in the field measured by procedures per system was up 6% from the prior-year quarter’s level.

Progress on the AI Front: We are also positive about the growing adoption of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries self-automated home-based care the use of information technology for quick and improved patient care and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model. These indicate the high prevalence of AI in the MedTech space.

Per management the rise of medical mechatronics powerful computing improved sensing microfabrication and molecular imaging have enabled new solutions to old problems. AI has been enhancing Intuitive Surgical’s product portfolio with clinical applications diagnostic support operational efficiency electronic health record systems practice workflows and supply-chain management.

Strong Q3 Results: ISRG’s solid third-quarter 2023 results also buoy optimism. Revenues were primarily driven by continued growth in the company’s da Vinci procedure volume. Intuitive Surgical has also been raising the price of procedures to fight inflationary pressure that also aided sales growth.

Story continues

Meanwhile the absence of any significant disruptions from COVID-19 during the third quarter seems promising which may accelerate procedure growth going forward. Although gross margin contracted operating margin improved during the third quarter (as anticipated). The declining trend in operating expenses is likely to continue in the fourth quarter of 2023.

Downsides

Risk of Procedure Adoption: Intuitive Surgical faces the risk of adoption of its procedures. This is because adoption growth takes time as each procedure needs to gain credibility. Furthermore the wide use of the company’s products requires training of surgical teams. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete such trainings.

CHARLES WHITLOW NEVER thought much about robots. Then a tumor grew on his prostate.

Whitlow just wanted to be rid of the diseased gland and return to running the Dirt Road BBQ his burger-and-catfish house off County Road 388 in Cusseta Alabama. His doctor had begun performing surgery with something called the da Vinci Surgical System a $1.5 million apparatus that promised the precision of a human surgeon and the arms of a Transformer.

Instead of stooping over an operating table a surgeon using this device sits at a video console using joystick-type controls and foot pedals to cut excise and repair. With small incisions minimal blood loss easier access to body cavities and a grip steadier and more nimble than a human hand the da Vinci held the promise of speedy recovery with fewer post-op complications than traditional surgery. As it was presented to him robotic surgery sounded simple Whitlow says. ""As if more or less a monkey could do it.""

On December 1 2010 Whitlow's prostate removal began just like any other at East Alabama Medical Center. At one point however something went wrong. According to a lawsuit Whitlow filed an arc of electricity leaped from da Vinci's robot instrument and seared a hole through his rectum. He spent 11 hours in the OR. The exact circumstances of the burn are being contested in court but the consequences to 67-year-old Whitlow remain undisputed: relentless pain incontinence and a shaken faith in the medical system.



In 2005 fewer than one in four prostatectomies were performed by robot. Today if you have a prostate tumor it's likely a robot will go after it. Intuitive Surgical Inc. the manufacturer of the da Vinci system is now sewing up as much of the country's remaining market as it can installing surgical robots even in community hospitals with fewer than 200 beds. Pleased with the rise in popularity of robotic prostate surgery hospitals are now boasting about using robots for a long list of other procedures with the same enticement that attracted Whitlow: easier surgery fewer negative outcomes.



It does sound promising: precision machines displacing fallible human beings operating in the most sensitive areas. But a growing number of practitioners—and patients like Whitlow—worry that the robot revolution came before the advantages were proven and that marketing not medicine has led the charge. Others question whether the astronomical price of these robots (ultimately added to your rising insurance premium) justifies their uncertain benefits in an era of runaway health care costs.

In 2013 these concerns coalesced in a sternly worded letter sent by the FDA to Intuitive Surgical. The FDA's complaint: The company had not adequately informed the government about device malfunctions and recall efforts. Reports of injuries last year shot up to more than six times the total of any previous year and reported deaths rivaled that of the previous five years combined—a spike the company attributes in large part to ads drumming up business for malpractice lawyers.



NATHANIEL WELCH

But this isn't just litigators looking for work. Last August Johns Hopkins University published research in the Journal for Healthcare Quality suggesting that complications from robotic surgery are under recognized with some incidents not reported to the FDA until after media coverage appeared. Plus in an anonymous survey 57 percent of surgeons said they had experienced a robot malfunction before or during a prostatectomy in the preceding five years. Most were forced to reschedule or convert to traditional surgeries.

""I think robotic surgery can be great"" says Whitlow's attorney Francois Blaudeau M.D. who is also a surgeon based in Birmingham Alabama. ""The problem is that we took a technology that was evolving and ran 180 miles an hour with it before we were sure what we had.""

In the opinion of Dr. Blaudeau and others robotic surgery is a promising concept that should have been rolled out with restraint and evaluation. Instead he says the robotics industry grew hungry for a market; as the technology began to catch on hospital administrators feared that if they had no robots patients would seek out a place that did. Demo robots started popping up in hospital lobbies shopping malls and even ballparks to attract gadget-loving men with a round of surgical Wii. ""Patients were driven to it because they thought 'Robotic prostatectomy is the way for me to save my erectile function'"" Dr. Blaudeau says.



Whether this robot can save a man from adult diapers or a limp member depends on which surgeons you ask and whose research you read. Each side in the debate eagerly produces reams of positive or negative results but no consensus has emerged says Christopher Schabowsky of ECRI Institute a Pennsylvania nonprofit that evaluates medical devices. ""To put things in perspective more than 4000 peer-reviewed journal articles focus on robotic surgery"" he says. A hundred more arrive every month. In the face of a data avalanche then why does the question remain open? ""Many of these studies are weak in quality"" Schabowsky says. ""They also lack consistency and the evidence isn't necessarily strong enough to determine whether using this device is better or worse.""

The rise of an unproven technology to surgical star status is a case study of the way medical devices are adopted in the United States. Today's da Vinci robot began as a military-backed research effort to find a way to remotely operate on wounded soldiers. In 1995 Fred Moll M.D. a doctor working for the medical-device manufacturer Guidant saw a demonstration of a prototype. Inspired he recruited two other cofounders to create Intuitive Surgical which remains the only seller of robotic devices for soft-tissue operations.



The first-generation da Vinci robot was cleared by the FDA in 2000 for general laparoscopic surgery based on data from two procedures: gallbladder removal and gastroesophageal reflux disease surgery. The green light came after Intuitive presented clinical data showing that the robot when used by a trained surgeon was as safe and effective as other laparoscopic devices. The law required only that the company prove da Vinci to be no worse than other methods. There was no mandate to demonstrate any benefit.

Within a year even before Intuitive had been cleared to do so it was angling for prostate business. The reason says its chief medical advisor Myriam Curet M.D. is that surgeons wanted an alternative to making 6-inch incisions in their patients. ""When the company was first starting out the plan was to do cardiac surgery. It was our urologist who saw the system being used and thought the robot would enable him to do a minimally invasive prostatectomy"" she says. ""The surgeons came to us.""

As the market expanded the popularity fed on itself says Paul Levy a former CEO of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. ""You have doctors going to conferences saying 'This is the best thing I've ever seen!' And off on the side they're quietly saying to colleagues ""Plus I'm getting a lot of business I didn't used to have.'""

When Beth Israel Deaconess's own doctors requested that the hospital buy them a robot Levy says they admitted that they did not think it would improve their outcomes which were already impressive. But when technology is driving the market forward practitioners want to move with it. So had he not invested in da Vinci robotics Levy would have faced a white-coat revolt. ""I would have lost my urologists"" he says.

BY 2003 THE same year Levy's Hospital bought its expensive robot Intuitive sales reps were being deployed across the country. Their mission was to not only sell units but also convince doctors to switch from traditional ""open"" surgery to ""dVP""—da Vinci code for prostatectomy by robot. An internal campaign urged them to ""drive dVP to standard-of-care in every market"" and to foster ""a competitive landscape between hospitals and surgeons."" An internal e-mail reminded reps to lobby surgeons to convert traditional procedures to robotic ones. ""Be proactive in finding cases to convert"" it read. ""Challenge each trained surgeon every time you see a [laparoscopic] or open case."" The strategy was remarkably successful. Today by the company's estimation robots perform more than 80 percent of prostatectomies.

So has the robot become so popular because doctors truly think it's better for patients or because having the latest gadget lures customers? It's actually a little of both says ECRI's Schabowsky. A substantial number of surgeons especially younger ones who grew up zapping alien invaders in video games believe the robot takes surgery to the next level he says. The hospitals and surgeons don't want to be left out of a hot and lucrative technological trend. Then there are the patients themselves he says. They want a surgical robot ""because they think that if it's a new toy it's going to give them better surgical outcomes.""



It's not hard to find surgeons who want the toy too. ""The fact is it's a smaller incision less pain and a more rapid recovery"" says Jim Hu M.D. of UCLA's department of urology. ""Some [traditional] surgeons would argue that the discomfort or the relative pain is no different but having done both surgeries I know there is a difference.""

Atlanta-based urologist Scott Miller M.D. who performed his first robotic prostate removal in 2003 adds that the system is also less taxing for surgeons. ""Anything that makes things physically easier for me really allows me to do what humans are best designed for and that's judgment.""

But both of those doctors admit that much of the quality depends upon the experience and skill of the person manipulating the robotic tools. During a malpractice case tried last year on behalf of a Washington State man who died from a botched robotic prostatectomy much of the plaintiff's argument came down to the fact that it was the doctor's first unsupervised run with a robot. Lawyers tried unsuccessfully to persuade the jury that the company knew the doctor's skills were lacking but pressured him to use it anyway. (The case is on appeal.)

Early on in Intuitive's sales push training for the robot was scaled back from three days to one—in the name of efficiency. (According to plaintiffs' attorneys no urologist has ever failed the course.) The fine-tuning would occur on actual patients in supervised operations. Dr. Miller believes that one reason safety concerns are growing is that some surgeons are using the robots before they're fully trained to do so. ""Whenever you have more people doing something you're going to have more diversity and experience levels"" Dr. Miller says.

The dilemma for a patient is that there's no magic number of surgeries you want a doctor to have under his or her belt before you allow that machine anywhere near your groin. To gauge the learning curve FDA officials recently interviewed robotic surgeons. ""One respondent who performed several hundred cases in a year using the da Vinci Surgical System during a fellowship did not feel proficient in the use of the device until after performing the first 40 to 50 procedures"" notes the FDA report. Dr. Hu puts the learning period at about four or five years. ""I did a fellowship where I assisted with 400 cases and I thought I was really good"" he says. But when he took the time to examine his data in detail he realized that his proficiency had taken years to mature.

Says Dr. Miller: ""Patients expect their case to be done robotically"" he says. ""Sometimes the medical profession succumbs to those pressures.""

DR. HU PREDICTS that problems with undertrained surgeons will diminish as the next generation of urologists completes residency with years of robotic training rather than a weekend practice run on pigs. That still leaves questions about the robot itself.

Reports of injuries parts recalls and product malfunctions have surged over the past year. For example from 2008 to 2011 the FDA received about 1600 reports of malfunctions with the robotic surgery machines. But in 2012 alone malfunctions exceeded 1200; in 2013 following an FDA inspection that number jumped to over 4000. This prompted some Intuitive stockholders to file a class-action suit alleging that the company tried to downplay the product's risks.

Company officials now say that the apparent alarming increase in 2013 device malfunctions and even recalls simply represents catch-up from past years. Their own analysis of overall adverse events has found that when the events are sorted out by the date of occurrence rather than date of report to the FDA the annual number has fallen.

Until early 2013 all of this was supposed to be an anecdotal problem says Javier Bleichmar the New York attorney who's leading the class-action suit. In other words the argument went despite noise from patients (and their loudmouthed lawyers) about malfunctions and injuries statistics told a different story and the robots were actually performing well. ""The company very often says Every medical device has product-liability problems.' We completely would agree with that. But what we're finding based on the change in reporting is that the numbers are massive.""

One of the biggest concerns the suit cites has to do with ""tip covers"" the insulation at the end of scissors that attach to a mechanical wrist. These can develop small tears when doctors scrape gunk off during surgery. (They're not supposed to do this but it's the quickest way to clean an instrument.)



Intuitive realized a few years ago that breaches in tip covers posed a burn threat. The company developed tougher replacement tips and in 2011 sent a reminder to hospitals about proper tip-cover care. But company officials did not feel the problem was significant enough to trouble the FDA with it. After an audit the FDA disagreed—not only with Intuitive's decision not to alert the agency to tip-cover deficiencies but also with its failure to keep the FDA in the loop on notifications it had been sending to robot owners.

Even if you assume that risk levels will eventually fall a sticking point remains: The hit to your wallet. Hospitals are competing to offer ""robotic firsts"" for all kinds of surgeries even on gallbladders where laparoscopic surgery already has a low complication rate says Marty Markary M.D. of Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. ""Here's an expensive new technology with a massive price tag"" he says but the benefits are unclear. ""This is exactly the story of what's wrong with American health care."" The cost is passed down the line until you the health care customer pay it in the form of higher bills and insurance premiums.

Even surgeons who use robotics regularly and like it question whether it's worth the cost. Beyond the purchase price hospitals must also sign a service agreement that can add as much as $170000 to the annual tab. And they have to buy replacement instruments which have a fixed number of uses regardless of whether they are actually worn out. As an example Yair Lotan M.D. a Dallas surgeon mentions the robot's needle driver. ""It doesn't rust. It just has to hold a needle. The robot counts and after 10 uses it doesn't work"" he says. ""No surgeon thinks it's rational but there's nothing you can do.""

American medicine has a history of embracing new technology first and asking questions later Dr. Lotan says. ""Our health care system is in financial distress and it's important to understand why. Doctors are removing gallbladders robotically and it makes no financial sense. At some point as a society we have to say We're spending this money and what are we getting?'""

With robotic surgery the answer may come too late to matter he says. No one is going back. ""Maybe with the next technology we will evaluate the cost-effectiveness prior to adoption.""

With 2023 almost behind us it's a great time to think about the new investing year just ahead. This doesn't mean you should completely revamp your portfolio but instead consider what may be missing from your holdings -- and if you have some cash available and the price of a particular stock is right make those additions.

One area to focus on is companies that generally offer steady earnings growth over time. Healthcare is the perfect place to find these players since patients need their medicines or procedures no matter what the economy is doing. Within this group you'll find tried-and-true names as well as up-and-coming players that may deliver an extra dose of growth.

Let's take a look at five of these top stocks to add to your portfolio before the new year.

1. CRISPR Therapeutics

CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP 3.59%) just reached a huge milestone and another may be just ahead. The company recently won the world's first authorization for a CRISPR-based gene-editing treatment when the U.K. gave the nod to exa-cel (to be commercialized as Casgevy). U.S. regulators are set to decide on the blood disorders treatment for sickle cell disease this month -- then for beta thalassemia in March.

This is big because it represents product revenue just ahead and this revenue could reach blockbuster levels. It's also a key event because it serves as a vote of confidence for the technology CRISPR Therapeutics uses across its pipeline. The company even has another candidate -- potential immuno-oncology treatment CTX-110 -- involved in a late-stage study that could support a regulatory request.

Meanwhile CRISPR Therapeutics stock is trading at a much lower level than it did in the past when we had less visibility about the future. Considering that this biotech is in the early stages of its story over time the shares could soar from today's level.

2. Eli Lilly

Eli Lilly (LLY -0.57%) has taken center stage thanks to its diabetes drug Mounjaro which doctors also have been prescribing for weight loss. In fact Mounjaro and rival products have become so popular that patients have faced shortages of the drugs as supply can't keep up with demand.

Lilly is increasing production capacity and in more good news the company recently won regulatory approval for the same molecule to specifically address weight loss. Lilly will sell the product as Zepbound. Mounjaro brought in $1.4 billion in sales during the most recent quarter so there's reason to be optimistic about the potential of both drugs to drive growth.

But Lilly isn't about just one or two products or one treatment area. The company sells dozens of products in areas including immunology cancer and neuroscience. And these drugs helped the company increase revenue 37% in the quarter with new products and growth products leading the gains.

Considering current growth and future potential thanks to new and high-growth products Lilly shares even after recent gains are likely to head higher over time.

3. Vertex Pharmaceuticals

Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX -1.18%) is known for its leadership in the global cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment market and its CF drugs have brought in billions of dollars in earnings. This is set to continue into the next decade thanks to current products and a very promising candidate in pivotal development right now.

So we can be confident about the CF program generating billion-dollar earnings well into the future. But Vertex is about to offer patients and investors even more. The company partnered with CRISPR Therapeutics on Casgevy -- so will benefit from sales there.

And Vertex is working on a candidate to address the very common problem of pain with VX-548 on track to complete its pivotal program by the end of this year. The company aims to share data from the trial early next year and if it's positive a commercial launch may not be far off.

You'll love Vertex for its all of the above -- and its reasonable valuation as it trades for 23x forward earnings estimates.

4. Intuitive Surgical

Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 0.21%) is the worldwide leader in robotic surgery with its flagship da Vinci system now installed in 8285 locations. What I like most about Intuitive is its moat or competitive advantage which should ensure ongoing market leadership.

Robotic systems cost millions of dollars so it's unlikely hospitals will easily switch to another provider if they're satisfied with the current platform. Also most doctors train on the da Vinci so they probably will support the idea of sticking with a system they know well.

I also like the fact that Intuitive generates most of its revenue not from selling the surgical robots -- but from selling the instruments and accessories needed for each surgery. This is great because it represents recurrent revenue and practically guarantees that every da Vinci sold or leased will keep generating income for Intuitive.

Intuitive shares have climbed this year but they're still trading lower in relation to forward earnings estimates than they were a couple of years ago. This and solid future prospects make the stock a great deal today.

5. Pfizer

Pfizer's (PFE -0.12%) revenue surged to record highs last year thanks to its coronavirus vaccine and treatment but today the big pharma faces two challenges: a decline in coronavirus product revenue and upcoming losses of exclusivity of certain older blockbusters.

That's soured some investors on Pfizer but this actually creates a top buying opportunity for the rest of us. The stock now trades for only 18.4 times forward earnings estimates.

Why buy Pfizer now? Because the company is set to compensate for patent losses and grow beyond them. Pfizer is in the middle of its biggest launch streak ever -- releasing 19 new products or indications over an 18-month period. It's completed 13 launches so far showing it's well on the way to meeting the goal.

Pfizer predicts non-COVID program revenues could reach $84 billion by 2030 representing more than 60% growth from pre-pandemic revenue.

Meanwhile you also can count on Pfizer for passive income -- the company is making dividend growth a priority and delivers a dividend yield that's higher than that of the S&P 500.

All of this makes Pfizer a top addition to your portfolio now so that you'll benefit from passive income in 2024 and likely share performance over time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndxYWQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9nZW5lc2lzLXN1cmdlcnktcm9ib3RzLWRlbW9uc3RyYXRpb25zLzUyNi1lYTM2YjU1ZS0xN2Y2LTQ3YmUtOTIwNC1iMjZiYjI3ZjA4NGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Surgery robot demonstration at Genesis Medical Center,"The robots helped a Genesis surgeon operate on a Bettendorf woman with colon cancer.

DAVENPORT Iowa — A demonstration of Intuitive's ION and da Vinci Xi surgery robots at Genesis Medical Center in Davenport gave spectators a taste of the future of medicine.

Robot-assisted surgeries are minimally invasive resulting in smaller incisions less pain and faster recovery times according to Genesis surgeon Robert Harson.

""We're able to use other adjunctive measures to make sure they have very minimal post-operative pain and have a very early return to their normal activities"" Harson said.

In the demonstration Harson manipulated a pair of claws with the da Vinci Xi system to move sets of rubber rings around through two openings in a practice apparatus. A representative from Intuitive showed how surgeons could use the ION robot to navigate through a model of a pair of lungs.

Harson said Genesis' robotic surgery program is the largest in Iowa with four machines and more than 20 different procedures in urology general surgery gynecology and lung biopsy. Genesis surgeons have performed at least 6700 of these procedures with the help of surgery robots according to a press release.

Lois Nichols a 91-year-old Bettendorf resident is a retired music teacher and Figge Art Museum docent. She experienced the benefits of one of Genesis' surgery robots first-hand in early October.

It took six years for doctors to find the correct diagnosis before she came to Genesis. In that time she lost nearly 25 pounds and suffered from pain and discomfort. After a colonoscopy at Genesis found colon cancer Nichols was sent to Harson to discuss her treatment options. She said the Genesis doctors who worked with her were attentive and caring throughout the process.

""Dr. Harson was wonderful about explaining"" Nichols said. ""He would explain something before I had to ask a question. By the time he got done talking about something I felt very pleased that he was in charge.""

Nichols has made a full recovery and is now cancer-free. She said she's been on her feet quite a bit since her surgery. As she works on regaining weight she said she's been a frequent customer of Whitey's Ice Cream to help her put back on the pounds."

Technology stocks as closely monitored through the Invesco QQQ Trust QQQ outpaced broader market gains with the Nasdaq 100 index escalating by 10.8% recording its fifth-best monthly result in a decade.

Additionally bond markets rallied as yields took a notable dip while metal commodities thrived in the wake of a weakening dollar.

Fueling this broad market rally was a surge in investor optimism anticipating Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in 2024 in response to cooling inflation. Speculative bets are now leaning towards the Fed commencing its rate-cutting cycle in March 2024 with up to five rate reductions by the end of next year.

Despite these positive data points it would be prudent to dive deeper and consider the potential impacts across multiple areas:

Bariatric surgery: MedTech companies that make devices related to bariatric surgery for weight loss should anticipate that physicians will aim to exhaust non-surgical options. This will likely impact this market but with the potential upside that BMI reductions due to GLP-1s may take more patients into the indicated weight range for bariatric devices.

Orthopedics: Similarly weight loss may reduce the wear and tear on joints or may qualify more patients for knee and hip replacements. People without obesity will continue to need joint replacements at the same rate as before.

A recent example is the SELECT trial finding that Ozempic (semaglutide) reduced cardiovascular events by 20% in overweight or obese adults with established heart disease and without diabetes. 2 The impact on cardiology practice remains to be seen although typically conservative approaches make it likely that stents pacemakers and other devices will continue to be widely used.

GLP-1s have been prescribed for diabetes for close to two decades since the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of such product exenatide in 2005. Devices such as continuous glucose monitors have built market share nonetheless and are increasingly used by individuals with prediabetes. Sleep apnea: Obesity is the main risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea raising the possibility that weight loss may reduce incidence of this disorder along with the need for continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices. 6Current evidence is limited but trials are ongoing. 7However future market development will depend on the patient journey and which approaches payers are willing to reimburse first. The relationship between weight and sleep is complicated - poor sleep quality definitely impacts weight loss and gain and there is a need for trials in this space to better assess the potential impact.

Making sense of dynamic market shifts

MedTech companies are already considering how best to articulate the continued value of their products – to audiences including regulators physicians payers and analysts. A crucial step is to understand the company’s target patient populations through the lens of GLP-1 use.

Creating the correct lens will take a combination of different of services to give a true picture and it will not be a one size fits all approach – starting with a comprehensive set of data assets including prescription data claims data longitudinal prescription data (LRx) and services such as IQVIA’s LAAD and MIDAS data.

Various analytical approaches will then be required to address specific business questions - including longitudinal analyses of GLP-1 patients vs. procedure data or device delay correlation between GLP-1s and other disease areas patient journeys and primary research – to generate the key insights needed so MedTech companies can plan and strategize with confidence. This work can be further enhanced with prospective real-world evidence (RWE) non-interventional studies to support payer conversations and publication plans.

By developing this in-depth understanding of the impacts of the GLP-1s on patient populations treatment paradigms and clinician messaging MedTech companies will be able to make informed strategic decisions to stay the course or pivot to other promising segments if needed. Based on more accurate forecasting of trends and opportunities in their specific markets firms will be in a strong position to communicate the true value of their product portfolios.

IQVIA MedTech is uniquely positioned to give immediate insights into the dynamics of GLP-1 markets and patient profiles at the global national and regional levels coupled with deep market expertise needed to uncover the vital insights needed. Complete this form to find out more.

Forty participants are using 48 campsites the most they can do right now said Ann Hruska secretary of Lake Antoine Park Partners which organizes the event.

“That’s about the limit to allow snowplowing to happen. They still have to plow the road and have a place to put it (the snow)” she explained.

“We have a waiting list and more people than spots this year” she said.

The event opened on Thanksgiving and extends through New Year’s Day. The public can drive through the park from dusk until 10 p.m. at no charge.

“We told the displays to be on by 4 (p.m.) because people start driving through early” Hruska said adding the displays are on timers. She asks that the public follow the signs and turn left when they enter the park.

The event has continued to grow. The first year had 18 participants then 30 last year.

Some have been in each year including Breitung Township Bacco Construction Boss Snowplow Erickson’s Jewelry Champion Inc. WJNR the Kiwanis Club Coldwell Homes the Dickinson County Road Commission Granny K’s Stop and Play and a couple of church groups.

She said they have one group that will decorate the snow fence at the beach.

“LAPP is grateful to all these folks that put up displays. Not only is it a financial commitment on their part but there’s a lot of creativity and team building and cold fingers that have gone into this” Hruska said. “It’s not easy to put up these displays in the cold. The ground is hard and you have to really plan for a lot of wind and snow. It takes a lot to anchor these displays. We had a 30-mile-an-hour wind the other day and you can tell.”

“We realize that takes a lot of effort. Some of them have been planning for a while for their display; you can tell. Every year folks kind of put a little more thought into it and it’s especially fun when it represents their business or their organization when it really speaks about them and you see that this year” she said.

Participants pay $30 per site and the money goes back into the event as they try to improve on the previous year. They added more lights at the entrance. Next year they may allow pavilions to be decorated.

For the first time they will be presenting a People’s Choice award. The public can vote online on the group’s Facebook page or in person at the park office/store. More than 200 votes already have been cast.

“It’s fun to watch the changes in voting” she said. “It’s early. There’s lots of voting time left.” Votes will be accepted until 10 p.m. Dec. 17.

The winner will receive $500 and “a cool hanging light bulb award that they can hang in their display so if people see a large red hanging light bulb they know they’re the winner.”

Also new this year is a open house planned from 6 to 8 p.m. Sunday Dec. 17 at the office.

“One of the participants asked if they could be present in their display at some point to greet people and put a face to those beautiful displays” Hruska explained. “We struggled with that because we want to make it safe and not have people driving and walking in the same place. Visitors will be able to drive through. Folks that have displays will be able to stand in their displays and give out candy or trinkets. Afterward the public can come to the office area.”

The Kingsford High School chorus will sing Christmas carols and the LAPP will provide free hot chocolate. Santa also will be on site.

“We thought that probably two hours is enough time to stand out in the cold” she said.

“Another cool thing is we have Upper Limits Media who will shoot some drone footage to post on Facebook so that folks near and far that can’t get out to the park can see the lights” she said adding they are donating their time.

Lake Antoine Park Partners also thanks the Dickinson County Road Commission for helping with traffic signage for the event. Specialty Granules decorated the front gates.

“We consider all those with displays and those who help behind the scenes as contributors to a big holiday gift to our community” Hruska said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNoLWF2aWF0aW9uLmNvbS9uZXdzLzEzNDcwNS1haXItdC1yYWlzZXMtNG1uLXRvLWludmVzdC1pbi1tb3VudGFpbi1haXItY2FyZ28tbGVhc2Vz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Air T raises $4mn to invest in Mountain Air Cargo leases,"Air T has raised USD4 million through trust preferred securities and plans to use the capital among other sources to boost the working capital of its subsidiary Mountain Air Cargo (MTN Kinston).

The cargo specialist operating primarily on behalf of FedEx added thirteen aircraft to its fleet during 2023 including ten Cessna 408Fs two ATR72-600Fs and one ATR72-200(F). The expansion marked almost a doubling of the carrier's fleet which currently stands at 32 aircraft in total and so required more working capital to support the operations.

Air T said the new funds will also be used to expand its aircraft and engine lease businesses. The holding will also invest in the MRO capabilities of recently acquired subsidiary Worldwide Aviation Services as well as in its ground equipment manufacturer Global Ground Support.

The holding also owns lessor Contrail cargo carrier CSA Air and numerous other firms. Each subsidiary operates independently. In the nine-month period that ended on September 30 2023 Air T posted an adjusted EBITDA profit of USD1.5 billion. Most of its operating revenues come from overnight cargo services.

The trust preferred securities sold by Air T are priced at 12.1% to maturity. The buyers have options to purchase another USD4 million worth of securities on the same terms. The holding is separate to another batch of securities worth USD5.4 million and said it would ""more likely than not"" be offering more securities soon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL2ZhbmRvbXdpcmUuY29tL2p1anV0c3Uta2Fpc2VuLXRoZS1tb3N0LXRlcnJpZnlpbmctZG9tYWluLWV4cGFuc2lvbi1kb2VzbnQtYmVsb25nLXRvLXN1a3VuYS01LW5pZ2h0bWFyaXNoLWV4cGFuc2lvbnMtcmFua2VkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jujutsu Kaisen: The Most Terrifying Domain Expansion Doesn't Belong to Sukuna - 5 Nightmarish Expansions Ranked,"Domain Expansion is the most powerful technique in Jujutsu Kaisen world but only the strongest ones can use it.

Featured Video

Jujutsu Kaisen is a popular action anime with strong characters with a range of interesting abilities. While the characters always try to get stronger the most powerful sorcerer in the series is arguably Sukuna with his Malevolent Shrine Domain Expansion.

In the world of Jujutsu Kaisen Domain Expansion is a special technique that allows users to trap others in their own space. This not only captures targets but also enhances curse techniques. As fans have witnessed various Domain Expansions they wonder which one is the strongest.

Sukuna’s Domain Expansion is undoubtedly the most powerful. However there are others that are scary and tough for opponents as well. Here is the list of the top five Domain Expansions that could be as strong as Sukuna’s or maybe even stronger.

5. Megumi Fushiguro’s Domain Expansion – Chimera Shadow Garden

Megumi a 2nd-grade sorcerer in Jujutsu Kaisen did something impressive by creating his own special power the Domain Expansion called Chimera Shadow Garden. Even though it’s not perfect with the right mindset it can defeat powerful enemies.

Megumi is part of the Zenin clan a major sorcerer family and has the unique ability called Ten Shadows Technique allowing him to summon ten different shikigami and store weapons in his shadows for fights.

He’s considered to have great potential even rivaling the series’ main character Yuji Itadori. In the “Cursed Womb” arcs both the powerful cursed spirit Sukuna and the strongest sorcerer Gojo praise Megumi’s abilities. All of this makes Megumi’s Domain Expansion one of the most promising powers in the series.

4. Jogo’s Domain Expansion – Coffin of the Iron Mountain

Jogo a powerful cursed spirit uses a Domain Expansion called Coffin of the Iron Mountain. This ability transforms the surroundings into a volcanic environment creating a large stone chamber where magma erupts from the ground. Only skilled jujutsu sorcerers can survive in this harsh setting.

Jogo can also launch a massive rock attack that is nearly impossible to evade posing a serious threat. Despite its terrifying nature there are ways to counter Coffin of the Iron Mountain. Gojo Satoru a skilled jujutsu sorcerer nullified Jogo’s attack and overwhelmed him by using his own Domain Expansion. This strategic approach proved effective in defeating Jogo’s formidable technique.

3. Mahito’s Domain Expansion – Self-Embodiment of Perfection

In the fight between Mahito Yuji and Nanami in Jujutsu Kaisen Mahito showed impressive growth especially when he unleashed his powerful Domain Expansion. Mahito can manipulate souls with his touch making him more dangerous than other special-grade cursed spirits.

Despite being a newer and less mature spirit than Jogo Mahito is considered a powerful Special Grade cursed spirit with the strength of at least three of Sukuna’s fingers. Even without his Domain Expansion Mahito’s natural ability is strong enough to knock out an opponent with one hit.

Fans are eager for Mahito to have a dedicated episode exploring his abilities power and backstory. Thanks to Yuji’s intervention Mahito’s Domain Expansion didn’t kill Nanami a Grade 1 sorcerer.

2. Satoru Gojo’s Domain Expansion – Unlimited Void

Gojo is a really likable character because he’s both charming and good-looking. He’s also super strong. In the Jujutsu Kaisen series he’s introduced as the strongest and he confidently says that defeating a fully revived Sukuna would be a bit tiring. In the first season every smart cursed spirit is told to stay away from Gojo and there’s a good reason for that.

Like Megumi Gojo has inherited techniques such as Six Eyes which lets him use cursed energy a lot and Limitless which gives him control over space. On top of these abilities Gojo was born with high intelligence plus he’s really strong fast and has quick reflexes. His Unlimited Void power is so strong that it completely paralyzes the cursed spirit Jogo when it’s revealed.

1. Kenjaku’s Domain Expansion – Womb Profusion

Kenjaku’s Domain Expansion Womb Profusion hasn’t been fully revealed yet but what we’ve seen already makes it one of the scariest in Jujutsu Kaisen. Unlike regular domains Kenjaku cast his without creating a separate space with a barrier technique a rarity.

Ryomen Sukuna is the only other character in Jujutsu Kaisen who has successfully used this type of domain. Fushiguro Megumi attempted a similar borderless Domain but it was less refined than Kenjaku’s or Sukuna’s.

Casting a Domain Expansion without borders has almost no disadvantages when facing an opponent trapped in the user’s space. By leaving Womb Profusion open Kenjaku essentially made Tengen’s entire space his own domain eliminating the need for an inner barrier to be destroyed.

With the 16-day season having ended Thursday hunters have until Sunday to report late-season harvests to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources’ online tracker.

Totals across the Upper Peninsula are trending down from 2022 which was the first year of mandatory reporting.

Menominee County is again the leader in the region. Its reported firearm harvest as of 5 p.m. Friday was 2139 antlered and 835 antlerless which compares a 2022 firearm total of 2492 antlered and 1256 antlerless.

Delta County shows a 2023 firearm harvest of 1958 to date including 1518 bucks. That compares to a 2022 total of 2499 which included 1716 bucks.

Dickinson County’s firearm harvest to date is 717 bucks and 245 antlerless which compares with 974 bucks and 366 antlerless in 2022. For Iron County the 2023 numbers are 665 antlered and 265 antlerless compared to 1032 and 555 in 2022.

Marquette County shows a 2023 firearm harvest to date of 866 antlered and 43 antlerless which is down from 1413 antlered and 105 antlerless a year ago.

Brian Roell wildlife biologist at the DNR’s Marquette office said warm and windy conditions on opening day were less than ideal.

For all of the U.P. the reported Nov. 15 harvest totals dropped from 3841 in 2022 to 2696 this year a 30% decrease. The buck count dropped from 3400 to 2489 a 27% decrease.

About 80% of the deer harvested in the firearm season are taken in the first couple of days Roell noted. Tough winters the past two years may have lowered the birth weights of fawns and taken a toll on adults as well as fawns he said.

Some hunters are unaware of the mandatory harvest reporting requirement or choose to ignore it Roell added. The agency will keep working on ways to get the message out he said.

Michigan’s muzzleloader season opened Friday and runs through Sunday Dec. 10.

Wisconsin’s muzzleloader season opened Monday and ends Wednesday. That will be followed by a four-day statewide antlerless hunt where all weapon types are allowed running through Dec. 10.

Hunters may use any unfilled antlerless harvest authorization but it must be used in the zone county and land type designated on the permit.

Applications for the 2024 spring turkey season in Wisconsin are due by the end of Dec. 10. Wisconsin black bear applications are also due Dec. 10.

Michigan’s spring turkey application period starts in January while the bear application period is in May.

Wisconsin’s lake trout season in Lake Superior is open and runs until Sept. 30 or until the harvest cap is met. To harvest a lake trout anglers must purchase a 2023-2024 general fishing license and a Great Lakes trout and salmon stamp. Licenses and stamps can be purchased online through the Go Wild system or at any license sales location.

Ice safety is urged on all waterbodies especially at this time of year. Frigid overnight temperatures often leave a thin layer of ice across smaller bodies of water but that ice is not strong enough to support the weight of a person or machine.

“After we have these first cold nights we start to see the early ice forming. It may look solid to the naked eye but it’s not” said Lt. Jacob Holsclaw Wisconsin DNR off-highway vehicle administrator. “There can be cracks and changes in the ice thickness that you won’t see until it’s too late.”

The concern comes as FMCSA looks at developing a new way to verify when a motor carrier is fit to operate trucks in interstate commerce known as a safety fitness determination (SFD). The agency issued a preliminary advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) in August to get public feedback on whether and how to revamp its current rating methodology.

FMCSA’s own statistics red-flags the problem. Of 690091 interstate freight carriers eligible for an FMCSA safety rating in 2021 646777 — roughly 94% — did not have a rating according to the agency’s most recent annual safety data published in December 2022.

“A system that rates less than 10% of the eligible population is unacceptable” wrote Lane Kidd managing director of the Alliance for Driver Safety & Security known as the Trucking Alliance in comments responding to the proposed rulemaking. The group consists of nine of the country’s largest truckload carriers including J.B. Hunt (NASDAQ: JBHT) Knight-Swift (NYSE: KNX) and Schneider National (NYSE: SNDR).

“These unrated carriers are treated disparately by brokers and shippers who must rely on other metrics to make important safety-based business decisions” Kidd stated.

The Transportation Intermediaries Association which represents truck brokers and 3PLs agrees.

“TIA supports a speedy rulemaking because one of the most significant challenges for the third-party logistics industry is the manner in which motor carrier safety ratings are currently being used by personal injury lawyers insurers and the media among others” said TIA Vice President of Government Affairs Chris Burroughs in comments filed with the notice.

“The misuse of safety ratings which manifests itself in nuclear verdicts higher insurance rates and reputational damage is especially acute in light of the fact that 90% of motor carriers are currently considered ‘unrated’.”





FMCSA admits to regulatory loopholes

FMCSA’s current SFD system is based on data collected during a compliance review investigation conducted either on-site at the motor carrier’s place of business or remotely through a review of its records using a secure portal.

After analyzing six factors — which incorporate crash involvement and hours of service violations — a carrier is assigned one of three safety ratings: satisfactory conditional or unsatisfactory.

But because of loopholes in the system a carrier is not prohibited from operating with a conditional rating even though a review revealed a safety breakdown. For example a carrier with a documented noncompliance in vehicle maintenance and controlled substances testing would receive a proposed conditional rating. If the proposed rating becomes final it still allows the carrier to continue operating.

FMCSA also admits that the current SFD process strains agency staff reaching only a small percentage of carriers. That leaves the majority without a rating at all setting up the potential for a huge number of unsafe trucks operating on the highways at any time.

“Because the agency has resources to issue safety ratings to only a small percentage of motor carriers each year a safety rating does not necessarily reflect the current safety posture of a motor carrier” the agency acknowledged in the ANPRM.

Potential solutions lack consensus

Most groups representing carriers shippers brokers and safety advocates agreed that the current system was broken and needed to be made simpler and more clear but differed on how to make that happen.

Solutions ranged from using a single “unfit” category advocated by the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance as well as proposed previously by FMCSA to expanding to a five-point number system supported by Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA).

“The current system is confusing and not intuitive” commented Madan Gopal staff safety strategy engineer for the Austin Texas-based company which is ramping up production of its long-delayed Semi electric truck.





“Also the meanings of ‘unsatisfactory’ and ‘conditional’ may be confused with one another. A five-point system with 1 assigned to ‘conditional’ and 5 assigned to ‘unfit-out of service’ may be more understandable.”

In between CVSA and Tesla is a call by TIA to move to a simple fit/unfit rating system.

“For many years TIA has been a strong proponent of a “red light/green light” system for the use of motor carriers as a substitute for the current confusing and conflicting” system Burroughs asserted.

“Not providing a safety rating of some kind for every carrier would continue the confusion and ambiguity that exists in the current [process]. This important change is not only essential to eliminating unsafe motor carriers from the road but also eliminating confusion in the marketplace as to what the existing ratings mean.”

The National Industrial Transportation League a shipper group supporting TIA commented “Think how many bad actors would be put out of business if shippers and 3PLs were told not to use them (unfit). A simple binary safety rating system that distinguishes a fit or unfit carrier will help clear up a great deal of confusion.”

But several carrier groups — the National Motor Freight Traffic Association representing LTL carriers; the National Association of Small Trucking Companies which represents small-business carriers; and the National Private Truck Council (NPTC) — believe FMCSA should retain its three-tier system.

Among reasons cited for keeping three categories versus a binary system NPTC asserted that eliminating “conditional” as a rating would mean carriers currently holding that status “would be compelled to suspend operations until such time as the agency could conduct another compliance review and reconsider the safety fitness rating whenever that might be” the group stated.

“It essentially forces the company out of its trucking operations.”

Evidence-based care typically means that clinicians have been trained in research-backed practices but there is no consensus in the industry. Thus the term “evidence-based” may be as helpful in determining quality of care as the “natural” label is for deciding which jar of peanut butter to buy industry insiders told Behavioral Health Business. While couching care practices in evidence is crucial the behavioral health industry may have a single-minded approach to evidence-based care.

“When we talk about evidence-based care most people are using it very loosely” Alethea Varra senior vice president of clinical care at Lyra Health told Behavioral Health Business. “The majority of providers don’t practice that treatment with fidelity. The term itself has gotten watered down.”

Lyra is a digital provider of mental health benefits available to over 15 million people worldwide. Founded in 2015 the company has more than $680 million in venture funding.

What is evidence-based care?

The concept of evidence-based care came into vogue within the last twenty or so years Varra said.

“A decade ago or certainly two decades ago there was a dichotomy in how people thought about evidence-based care” Varra said. “There were academics who were doing these rigorous manualized treatments and that’s evidence-based care. There were people who believed in that truly but there were a lot of people who said ‘Those are academically based. They’re not something you can translate into everyday practice.’”

As more research was conducted approaches broadly shifted to become rooted in evidence. Now most providers train in evidence-based care.

“It’s actually a little bit difficult to find a treatment setting or mental health treatment setting that doesn’t say they do evidence-based care” Varra said. “But when you dig underneath that a little bit that doesn’t actually bear out in terms of their day-to-day practice.”

Evidence-based care as defined by the American Psychological Association is the “integration of the best available research with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics culture and preferences.”

In practice evidence-based care is not always straightforward. It requires an intersection of three concepts David Jones chief medical officer and director of medical operations at Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield Georgia Commercial told Behavioral Health Business.

“One is scientific evidence” Jones said. “The second is clinical judgment. And the third is a patient’s values and preferences. It’s applying those elements to medical practice to help optimize decision-making and clinical management.”

Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield Georgia is the trade name of Blue Cross Blue Shield Healthcare Plan of Georgia Inc. The health plan has 4.1 million members and 5500 associates.

Some evidence is stronger than others Jones said requiring physicians to use their own judgment on what practices to employ.

The third element of evidence-based care is ensuring the right type of evidence-based care is applied to each patient.

“Every person is different” Jones said. “The scientific evidence our clinical judgment and knowing this patient all comes into play to … tailor to this situation and this patient.”

There is no one-size-fits-all when it comes to evidence-based care. As a result Lyra uses an AI-driven platform to match patients to providers.

“It’s not just saying ‘Oh here’s the provider who is licensed in your state congratulations you’re matched'” Varra said. “It’s really saying ‘Here’s a provider who we know has been effective with people who are struggling with exactly what you’re struggling with over and over and over again. They are our top recommendation because we know if you go to see them your chances of getting better are way higher than if you go see some other random therapists out there in the world.”

Lyra also practices evidence-based care Varra said by recruiting people who actively demonstrate a commitment to evidence-based therapy providing over 100000 hours of APA-accredited training and consultation for its clinicians in a single year and having standing consultations with providers to regularly review cases.

If not evidence-based care what should be the focus?

Focusing on the phrase “evidence-based” ignores the real problems in the behavioral health industry Mill Brown chief medical officer at Spring Health told Behavioral Health Business.

New York-based Spring Health began as a business-to-business behavioral health organization with over 4500 clients including Microsoft The Hershey Company JB Hunt Bumble and Fujifilm.

“I hear it all the time – ‘Are you doing evidence-based therapy?”’ Brown said. “Yeah we sure are. We have a lot of people who do evidence-based therapy. But the point is can you get people in care?”

While evidence-based practices matter Brown said they are only one element of providing proper care.

“In our world we’ve focused on what’s evidence-based therapy instead of access to care or therapeutic alliance” Brown said. “Getting that connection and staying engaged in care are actually the critical components then it’s evidence-based care.”

Using evidence-based practices can improve access for patients Varra said.

“Protecting quality is protecting access” she said. “People try to draw a line between access and quality and I think that’s the wrong approach. … One of the ways that Lyra is able to maintain access is that the people who come to Lyra actually get better and they get better faster so they graduate from care. That opens up another spot for somebody else to come to care.”

Although some providers may think evidence-based care may be overblown it remains an important factor for payers.

Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield Georgia Commercial develops adopts and vets programs through an evidence-based lens.

“Any vendors we use or vet to ensure that what they provide is evidence-based meets our member’s needs and is aligned with our approach to evidence-based medicine” Jones said.

Evidence-based care is crucial Jones said but it’s still important to evaluate care to determine if it’s genuinely evidence-based.

“It’s important to have a skeptical eye to say whenever you hear or see that” Jones said.

While there may be reason to question the behavioral health industry’s focus on evidence-based care employing evidence-based measures is still critical for patient outcomes.

“When you get the right treatment to the right diagnosis for the right person you see much much stronger recovery outcomes longer lasting outcomes in terms of that recovery and really life-changing experiences in therapy” Varra said.",,,,,,,,,

Exchange Monitor discussed the announced merger by phone Monday with two executives from large contractors and one at a smaller contractor. They said the merger could produce competitive disadvantages stretching from the Hanford Site in Washington state to the West Valley Demonstration Project in New York state.

Litigation continues in federal courts on the Hanford Integrated Tank contract. Jacobs and Amentum are on opposite sides of that dispute and have been since well before they announced merger plans last week.

On one side is BWX-Technologies-led Hanford Tank Waste Operations & Closure the team that won the contract and which also includes Amentum and Fluor.

On the other is Hanford Tank Disposition Alliance a joint venture of AtkinsRéalis Nuclear Secured Jacobs and Westinghouse. The BWXT-led group won the big award but the Atkins-led group sued and convinced a federal court to make DOE reconsider the award.

Other sites could be affected too.

On the other side of the country DOE has said it could issue the final solicitation for the next phase of West Valley remediation in December. The business could be worth up to $3 billion. Two sources said Amentum and Jacobs were both planning at least prior to last week to lead teams for the successor contract to the one held by a team of Jacobs’ affiliate CH2M and BWXT. BWXT was rumored to be leading the third team.

The new Amentum-Jacobs contracting combination would be a “fierce competitor” that can “go after anything and everything” one of the three industry sources said. The same source said Amentum is the more dominant of the two partners when it comes to DOE business while Jacobs seems to do better with the Department of Defense.

“It’s very harmful to the competitive environment” said another of the industry sources.

For small contractors it means “one less big team to get on” said the third industry source. The source sees little chance of the combination being blocked on antitrust grounds although mergers in the nuclear field have been blocked before.

In 2017 a federal judge in Delaware blocked EnergySolutions’ planned acquisition of Waste Control Specialists. The Justice Department opposed the deal fearing too much consolidation in the market for disposal of low-level radioactive waste.

Officials with the two companies said last week they hope to complete the merger in mid-2024. According to a Jacobs 8-K report filed with the Securities & Exchange Commission.

Either company can cancel the merger if it is not consummated within 13 months of Nov. 20 2023 which would translate to about Dec. 20 2024.

Jacobs CEO Bob Pragada said last week he does not expect the Federal Trade Commission to delay the merger on antitrust grounds.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbXBhaWdubGl2ZS5jby51ay9hcnRpY2xlL3doeS1wdWJsaWNpcy1wdWxsaW5nLWFoZWFkLXJpdmFscy1zZWxsaW5nLXByb2R1Y3RzLW5vdC1qdXN0LXNlcnZpY2VzLWtleS8xODQ5NDc10gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why is Publicis pulling ahead of rivals?

Jacob Galliher killed in Air Force crash ‘brought out the best’,"The Massachusetts airman killed when his aircraft went down off the coast of Japan on Wednesday was “a quiet leader” known for hard work and bringing out the best in those around him his former football coach and others who knew him said Friday.

The military on Thursday informed the family of Staff Sgt. Jacob Galliher a native of Pittsfield that rescue crews had recovered his body from the ocean a family member said. Another seven airmen also on board the lost aircraft were still missing Friday according to the Air Force.

Galliher joined the Air Force after graduating in 2017 from Taconic High School in Pittsfield where he played football.

Former Pittsfield Public Schools Athletic Director Jim Abel said Galliher was “an approachable popular fun-loving student at Taconic” who “embodied the characteristics you’d like to see demonstrated by your son your student or your teammate.”

Pittsfield Fire Department Capt. Jim Ziter who coached Taconic football until 2020 said Galliher was “one of the hardest workers” on the team possessed “a great sense of humor” and “brought out the best in all his teammates.”

Galliher joined the football team as a freshman and was a talented running back and defensive back — “but more importantly a great kid” Ziter said in a phone call with MassLive on Friday.

“He never had a bad thing to say about anything” Ziter said. “He was a quiet leader but he didn’t have to be vocal. He led by example.”

Abel said Galliher was part of a group of “committed gritty selfless athletes” whose hard work built the football team from a period of lopsided losses to its first Western Massachusetts Championship in Galliher’s senior season.

“Jake Galliher was one of those student-athletes that helped set the tone and culture of the school – on the playing fields and more importantly in the classrooms and school hallways” Abel said by email Friday.

A flag outside Taconic High School hung at half-staff Friday as news spread of Galliher’s death. In a statement school Principal Dr. Matthew Bishop said Galliher “embodied the values that we hope to instill in all of our students.”

Galliher left behind his wife Ivy 2-year-old and 7-week-old sons “a loving family and countless friends all of whom are grappling with this profound loss” a statement from Galliher’s family on Friday said. The family lives on a military base in Japan.

“Jake was an amazing father son and brother dedicated to his family and friends and we look forward to telling his story when the time is right” the statement. For now the family asked for privacy as they processed an “unimaginable loss.”

They extended their thoughts and support to the families of the seven other crew members missing after the aircraft crash on Wednesday.

The Air Force Special Operations Command said a CV-22B Osprey a plane-helicopter hybrid “was involved in an aircraft mishap while performing a routine training mission off the shore of Yakushima Island Japan” on Wednesday. At a press briefing Thursday Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said the cause of the crash remained under investigation.

U.S. Rep. Richard Neal D-1st District who represents Pittsfield said in a statement that Galliher “represented our nation’s best.”

“As a father my heart goes out to Staff Sgt. Jacob Galliher’s mother and father during this difficult time” Neal said Friday. “Any parent will tell you there is no greater pain than the pain of losing a child and Jacob Galliher was beloved by all.”

Galliher was a military linguist stationed in Japan a role for which he trained two years. He was fluent in Mandarin Chinese his family told the Berkshire Eagle.

“The Galliher family is enduring every service family’s nightmare and we hold them in our hearts and prayers as they grieve” Massachusetts Veterans Services Secretary Jon Santiago said in a statement Friday. “May his memory serve as a source of solace and strength to his family friends and fellow servicemembers. Our Massachusetts military community extends our deepest condolences to his family and will honor his legacy.”

Gov. Maura Healey mourned Galliher’s loss in a statement Friday and said her thoughts were with “his family especially his two young sons and the Berkshire County community as they mourn the loss of one of their best and brightest.”

Yakushima Island near where the Osprey crashed is about 40 miles southwest of the Japanese mainland.

The Osprey aircraft takes off and lands like a helicopter but during flight can rotate its propellers forward and cruise much faster like an airplane.

Ospreys have had a number of accidents in the past including in Japan where they are deployed at U.S. and Japanese military bases.

In Okinawa where about half of the 50000 American troops are based Gov. Denny Tamaki told reporters Wednesday that he would ask the U.S. military to suspend all Osprey flights in Japan the Associated Press reported.

The Dallas office of Morrison & Head and North Texas-based Meritax have agreed to a merger that will create a combined entity that represent $50 billion in real estate value. Under its new entity Meritax Advisors the two companies will move its headquarters to Hall Park in Frisco.

The firm will be led by Morrison & Head Partner Ryan Chismark Morrison & Head Partner Mark Kline and Meritax Principal Charles Honea. Morrison & Head also has Houston and Austin offices and it’s expected that Dallas-based tax firm Ryan will acquire those operations.

“Consolidation continues to occur in our industry” Chismark told D CEO. “I don’t believe it’s due to a superior model being offered—it’s really due to a lack of succession planning. Disposition creates an exit strategy for senior partners seeking to monetize. Most didn’t have an exit strategy in mind. Service businesses often struggle with this issue we didn’t have a need to monetize and look forward to continuing to compete.

“[For our merger] we spent a lot of time being introspective. We thought about what was working what opportunities existed and what was best for our clients in the long term. Ultimately partnering with a firm with a similar value system made the most sense.”

Honea added “We are excited about the opportunities this merger presents. Together we will leverage our collective strengths to deliver exceptional value to our clients helping them achieve their property tax objectives and unlock additional asset value.”

Jacobs Merges Two Departments With Amentum

Jacobs plans to spinoff and combine its Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber & Intelligence government services businesses with Amentum to create a new publicly traded player in the government services sector. The combination creates a company with $13 billion in annual revenue.

“By separating CMS and associated Cyber & Intelligence Solutions Jacobs will streamline our business portfolio and transform into a more focused higher-margin company more closely aligned with key global megatrends” said Jacobs CEO Bob Pragada. “We believe this transaction is in the best interests of the company and our stakeholders gaining the benefits of a tax-efficient transaction plus even greater value with significant cash proceeds and future realization of synergies.”

Jacobs’ Cyber & Intelligence Solutions which shares synergies with CMS generated $807 million in revenue (approximately 85 percent of DVS’s revenues) in fiscal year 2023. Excluding the businesses being separated Jacobs generated approximately $10.9 billion in revenue in fiscal year 2023.

Jacobs Executive Chair Steve Demetriou will become executive chair of the combined company. John Heller the current CEO of Amentum will serve as CEO of the combined company and sit on the combined company’s board and Dr. Steve Arnette EVP and president of CMS will serve as the COO. The transaction is expected to close in the second half of fiscal year 2024.

PepsiCo Commits $20 Million to United Way of Metropolitan Dallas

Fueled by PepsiCo United Way of Metropolitan Dallas has launched a new Southern Dallas Thrives Fund to support short-term and long-term needs of the Southern Dallas community. The fund has already secured $8 million in commitments toward its $20 million goal supported in part by three current and retired PepsiCo employees including PepsiCo Foods North America CEO Steven Williams.

“More than a program Southern Dallas Thrives is a model partnership and collaboration that advances economic mobility for some of Dallas’ most vulnerable and marginalized residents” said Williams. “We know that in order to create a community where everyone has the opportunity to thrive we also have to create the access to thrive and that’s exactly why Southern Dallas Thrives is so successful and why we endorse and support it wholeheartedly.”

Other organizations making investments in Southern Dallas Thrives include Celanese Vistra AT&T Comerica Trinity Industries Oncor Hilti and Bank of Texas.

“Despite national declines reported by Giving USA this year in philanthropic giving the North Texas corporate community is incredibly generous and highly invested in the DFW community by providing financial support and volunteering engagement granting everyone the access and opportunity to thrive” Jennifer Sampson the president and CEO of UWMD told D CEO.

“UWMD serves as a bridge between the corporate and nonprofit communities as a corporate social responsibility adviser and partner to help businesses invest in community-based programs that align with their charitable goals and vision. The Texas miracle is a corporate philanthropic investment that is a big part of overall philanthropic growth in the Dallas region. Some initiatives include improving preschool education providing summer meal plans and partnering with Goodr to expand access to groceries in southern Dallas food deserts college and career prep for high school students and workforce development for women.”

The funds will be used to:

Improve preschool education: “We work directly with Southern Dallas child care centers to provide resources and training to enhance program quality to help prepare young children for school success measured by Kindergarten readiness through our First Five program supported by the PepsiCo Foundation” Sampson said.

Provide meals for Southern Dallas families: “We work with partners across the community to expand access to summer meal programs for students when school is not in session” Sampson said. “We’ve also expanded access to groceries in Southern Dallas food deserts through a partnership with Goodr supported by PepsiCo.”

Prepare high school students for college and their career: “We’ve created student resource centers at Southern Dallas high schools including providing laptop communities and digital literacy training for students with support from AT&T and Texas Instruments” Sampson said.

Provide workforce development training for women: “Through our Women in Trades program supported by Hilti North America we partner with Dallas College to provide job training and job access for high growth industries within the construction field” Sampson said.

The Dallas Open Moves Tournament to The Star

The Dallas Open is relocating its tournament from SMU to the Ford Center at The Star in Frisco the Dallas Cowboys HQ and training facility. The tournament will debut at its new location in 2025. The upgrade provides players the opportunity to earn more ATP ranking points at the Dallas Open and will offer approximately $2.8 million in prize money.

“The success of this action-packed tournament over such a short time makes it a natural draw for sports fans who flock to Ford Center at The Star in Frisco” said Charlotte Jones owner and chief brand officer for the Dallas Cowboys. “This facility and campus was built not only as the World Corporate Headquarters for the Dallas Cowboys but also to host world class events like this one and we’re thrilled to host the stars of pro tennis at Ford Center at the Star in Frisco.”

The Dallas Open will be one of 16 global events at the 500-level and one of only two in the U.S. Earlier this month the ATP selected the Dallas Open as one of three tournaments worldwide to be elevated to the 500-level from a pool of 17 applicants."

On May 12 the Moana actor shared a Mother's Day tribute to his wife Lauren Hashian alongside a video of the pair singing excerpts from two Sam Cooke tracks: ""Bring It On Home to Me"" and ""Nothin' Can Change This Love.""

""One human here is illuminated today on Mother’s Day because she is blessed from the heavens above with kindness empathy compassion beauty and an abundance of musical talents that can only be God given with the voice and harmonies of an angel — all while being the greatest mama in the world to our babies"" began Johnson 52.

""The other human here ruins songs by making up vulgar lyrics followed by a very sinful laugh while confidently singing in keys that don’t exist — and upon being questioned about song structure he’ll simply insist 'We make up the rules'"" he joked. ""And I’m quite sure there’s tequila in his energy drink can.""



""Happy Mother’s Day @laurenhashianofficial. Mimi & Aja too. #playitagainSAM 🥃"" Johnson concluded.

Johnson and Hashian began dating in 2007 and later welcomed daughters Jasmine 8 and Tiana 6 before going on to tie the knot in 2019. (The Jungle Cruise actor is also dad to 22-year-old daughter Simone Johnson with ex-wife Dany Garcia.)

Hashian who is a musician previously showed off her vocal talents last Thanksgiving when she joined Johnson and musician Eric Zayne for a little session at the piano.

In a clip shared by Johnson on Instagram Zayne played the piano as Hashian sat on a chair next to him and they both belted out the lyrics to Billy Joel's ""Just the Way You Are"" with the actor joining in as he leaned over the top of the grand instrument.

""A lil’ Thanksgiving tickling of the ivorys with the two beautiful voices and talents of @laurenhashianofficial & @ericzayne and me just making up lyrics to an all time classic @billyjoel"" Johnson wrote.



Hashian is equally fond of her ""amazing man"" having posted a sweet tribute to the actor earlier this month in honor of his birthday alongside a photo of Johnson holding their girls.

""I do not want to let this birthday go by without saying the gratitude I feel to spend each birthday with you just gets more special and more sentimental every year … to have so many years under our belts"" she began. ""And yet also feel so many new things are just beginning in our lives especially as our little girls are just taking this world by the reigns and making each day so FULL of Life! Discovery! Laughter! And Love!""

Hashian went on to thank Johnson ""for the endless blessings you bring to our world"" as well as for being their family's ""leader"" for his ""love"" for his ""desire for growth"" for his ""inspiration"" and for his ""big strong hugs.""

""Thank you for how you root us give us a beautiful foundation to stand on and keep us safe and warm in your energetic embrace. I LOVE YOU YSHSOAG! The day you were born is a true celebration!!! WE LOVE YOU!!!"" she concluded.

COLORADO SPRINGS Co. -- Downhill skier Breezy Johnson has been banned for 14 months for three violations of anti-doping rules and can't race until December.

The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency published its decision late Monday for Johnson’s failure to comply with the whereabouts rules. They oblige athletes to detail where they can be found for one hour each day to give a sample with no advance notice.

Athletes have been banned for up to two years if they have three violations in a 12-month period such as missed tests or failures to update accurate details of their location.

Johnson’s whereabouts failures were on Oct. 29 2022 then June 13 2023 and Oct. 10 2023 USADA said. A seven-time podium finisher in World Cup races she left the circuit in December while under investigation.

USADA said 14 months was an appropriate ban for the 28-year-old Johnson because her “degree of fault was relatively low given the circumstances of the case.”

Johnson did not race in the World Cup last season and is not scheduled to miss any races next season in her specialist downhill and super-G events before the ban expires on Dec. 9.

The USADA ruling can be challenged by the World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation on appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Johnson’s race career peaked in a one-year period through December 2021 when she had three runner-up finishes and four third-places in World Cup downhills.

She missed the 2022 Beijing Olympics due to a knee injury she picked up three weeks before the games.

The fine follows an inspector general investigation and a November probable cause finding from the board which Conyears-Ervin was given the opportunity to rebut in the interim. In line with ethics board policy Conyears-Ervin was not named.

“We have engaged in this process with seriousness and good faith and are disappointed in today’s action” Conyears-Ervin spokesman Brian Berg said in a written statement. “We are evaluating all options available to us and remain confident that a fuller airing of the validity of these years old allegations and questionable actions of investigators will paint a fuller picture — and we look forward to that day. Until then we will continue to respect what is supposed to be a confidential process.”

Monday’s fine comes on the heels of a separate $60000 penalty levied against the treasurer by the same board last month. They found on “multiple occasions” Conyears-Ervin violated her fiduciary duty made unauthorized uses of city property and conducted prohibited political activities according to a board summary.

The Tribune first reported on allegations made by former aides Tiffany Harper and Ashley Evans who said they were retaliated against and ultimately fired after reporting the misconduct. Former Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration paid out a $100000 settlement to the two then fought for roughly two years to conceal the details of their whistleblower complaint.

Mayor Brandon Johnson released that information after taking office.

Separately Chicago ethics leaders on Monday criticized Johnson for failing to fill vacancies on the city’s ethics board and an “abrupt” pullback from plans to tighten rules for contractors and candidates for city office.

William Conlon the typically amiable chair of the seven-member Board of Ethics criticized Johnson’s slow pace to fill two vacant spots on the board which have been empty since July 2022 and March 2023.

Two other members’ terms will expire this summer. If those four positions aren’t filled before the end of July the board will not have enough members to legally meet.

“As you can tell we are still down two members a task that can’t be that difficult” Conlon said during Monday’s board meeting. “We have two members whose terms are set to expire at the end of July. Two clear-thinking independent thoughtful people who do their homework and are here participating every time. Why they have not been reappointed baffles me.”

Johnson spokesman Ronnie Reese said three candidates will be submitted for those board vacancies this month “with approval anticipated at the June City Council meeting.”

Steve Berlin the board’s longtime executive director added that he was “sad to report” there were “no current plans to hold a committee meeting or ethics committee hearing on the proposed amendments” to the city’s ethics ordinance.

Though ethics changes were legislative hallmarks of the early months of Johnson’s two predecessors the mayor has not embraced any new changes to the city’s oversight rules. Without mayoral support such changes typically wither on the vine in the City Council.

“I know that Ald. (Matt) Martin is disappointed in this as well” Berlin said.

Martin 47th chair of the City Council Committee on Ethics and Government Oversight took up the board’s proposed changes and said they would be a priority for passage this spring. Instead the committee has canceled two scheduled meetings in recent months.

Martin told the Tribune he was “frustrated” about the board vacancies and confirmed there was no timeline to take up ethics reform.

“I don’t think that we’re yet in a place where there’s alignment across the committee and the mayor’s office” regarding ethics ordinance amendments Martin said declining to comment on the misalignment. “So we’ll continue to work on that but I don’t have a timeline for when we might be able to take those up.”

The mayor’s office did not comment on the amendments.

The board’s proposed changes — spurred in part by Tribune reporting — include barring contractors who work for aldermen from getting involved in any city decisions that benefit their own financial interests or that benefit other clients or employers.

The changes would also “make clear that no candidate or political fundraising committee may for example send emails soliciting political contributions or campaign work to city employees or officials to their official city email addresses” a response to Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s mayoral campaign sending emails to Chicago Public Schools staff seeking student interns.

Earlier this year Johnson described those proposed reforms as “a positive step toward a more accountable city government” but did not otherwise comment on his ethics priorities.

During Monday’s ethics board meeting Bryan Zarou policy chief for the Better Government Association said there was an “abrupt” and “troubling” pullback of mayoral support from the ethics amendment ordinance and he had not received a clear explanation why.

Conlon described that as an “unfortunate surprise.”

In the meantime Martin said his committee would hold hearings on inspector general findings and audits and potentially codify an old executive order banning lobbyists from donating to the mayor.

Four registered lobbyists were initially dinged by the board for donating to Johnson’s campaign. That violated a 2011 executive order signed by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel barring such donations.

The board found though it had no authority to enforce the order nor did the city’s inspector general have power to formally investigate potential violations. The board dismissed the cases against those lobbyists.

While Johnson returned the donations and his campaign said the policy was “sound and necessary” he said last month that codifying the rule is not something he’s “spent a lot of time thinking about” according to WBEZ and that he would “take another look at it.”

(Mikey Williams/Top Rank)

The announcer at RAC Arena was not having a good day on Sunday.

The scene was reminiscent of when Steve Harvey crowned the wrong Miss Universe in 2015 or of the “Moonlight” debacle at the Oscars in 2017. It was rough.

Cherneka Johnson beat reigning WBA bantamweight champion Nina Hughes on Sunday in Perth Australia via a majority decision. But when ring announcer Dan Hennessey a former United States Marine stepped up to announce her as the winner he completely butchered the delivery. That made for a very confusing scene in the ring.

Hennessey misread the scorecards when making his announcement and he accidentally declared Hughes the winner. Suddenly it was her arm in the air and the 41-year-old started celebrating.

Pretty quickly though he corrected his mistake as if nothing had happened. He read the scores again apparently correct the second time and Johnson's arm was lifted in the air. That left Hughes and the announcers on the broadcast incredibly confused.

Just watch the scene unfold:

Watch this whole sequence. Never seen this. pic.twitter.com/EpsQkS7JRA — Ariel Helwani (@arielhelwani) May 12 2024

ESPN’s Joe Tessitore erupted on the “absolute clown show garbage amateur hour” announcing from Hennessey too while trying to explain to viewers in the U.S. what had actually happened.

The error wasn’t Hennesseey’s only one of the night either. He messed up the scorecards for the Pedro Guevara-Andrew Moloney fight earlier in the night too. The problem for him is apparently nothing new.

Even though she was briefly robbed of the celebration and just about everyone involved was confused Johnson got her win. In theory that's all that really matters."

Each trend provides HVACR professionals with several opportunities while addressing their own set of unique challenges as well. These include regulatory changes advances in technology and an ever-growing focus on sustainability and electrification.

Industry professionals must understand how to best take advantage of the opportunities each trend presents. Understanding the current state of HVACR and where the industry is heading will empower continued success in the new year and beyond.

Electrification Decarbonization & High-Efficiency Systems

The HVACR industry has faced notable regulatory changes in 2023 but it has also been a year of significant growth and innovation. Advancements in technology and a growing focus on sustainability have enabled the production of more efficient digitally connected solutions for both residential and commercial spaces.

The push toward decarbonization and electrification continues to accelerate driven largely by unstable energy costs legislation and climate change. As a result we’ve seen an emphasis on renewable energy sources and demand for high-efficiency HVACR systems including the adoption of heat pumps across all sectors.

Additionally the integration of smart technology has become an undeniable expectation for both homeowners and building managers. Controls and thermostats enhanced by the Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity and artificial intelligence (AI) have become a mainstay providing increased insight into system performance energy efficiency and customized comfort.

Customers Expect More Than Comfort

How is the industry changing? Both residential and commercial customers now expect more than comfort from their HVACR systems — they want healthy energy-efficient homes and buildings that are aligned with environmentally responsible practices.

A shift in focus from simple comfort to IAQ and energy efficiency is driving an investment in systems and technologies that can enhance indoor air quality (IAQ) and optimize energy use. Options like zoning and smart controls are must-haves for homeowners and building managers who want to easily manage energy use and air quality improvements. Additionally within the commercial sector building managers are now being tasked with accessing the carbon footprint of the building and providing proof of progress toward net-zero goals. Advanced digital platforms can connect and digitally automate diverse data sets from multiple systems to optimize building performance manage emissions and analyze results.

Leverage Opportunities for HVACR in 2024

What opportunities lie ahead for HVACR in the coming year?

The HVACR industry operates within a complex regulatory landscape with evolving codes and standards. Being able to understand and stay ahead of these changes while balancing consumer demands presents a huge opportunity to drive growth and industrywide sustainability.

As an industry we can expect to see a continued emphasis on decarbonization electrification and renewable energy sources which will also open up many opportunities for the HVACR industry in both product development and digitalization.

What challenges are expected for the HVACR industry?

The industry is facing back-to-back regulatory changes. DOE’s 2023 energy efficiency regulations are now closely followed by the EPA transition to low-GWP refrigerants going into effect in 2025. Distributors and contractors that have developed solid phase-in/phase-out plans have an advantage. The phase-out of high-global warming potential (GWP) refrigerants poses a significant challenge for the HVACR industry. Adapting to new refrigerants and ensuring compliance with evolving regulations can require investment in research development and technician training.

Hybrid System Heat Pumps are ‘Hot’

Which innovations have the potential to make the biggest impact?

With the industry’s focus on electrification and decarbonization and its extensive investment in technology heat pumps are solidly positioned to make a huge impact. Innovation in heat pump technology is unfolding rapidly and the space is incredibly dynamic. As a result heat pumps are being leveraged to address an increasing share of heating loads.

However it’s important to note that most air-source heat pump systems need to include some form of backup or supplemental heat that is utilized when heating demands exceed capacity such as when the outdoor temperatures are too cold for the heat pump to run efficiently. Hybrid systems provide a solution to maintain efficiency in very cold climates. In a hybrid system a heat pump is connected to a high-efficiency gas furnace and can seamlessly adjust between heating sources depending on the heating demands. This will often result in lower operating costs and source emissions compared to electric resistance for space heating but results will vary on a building-by-building basis.

Integrated Building Systems Get Smarter

Adding to the increased focus on IAQ and energy efficiency it’s also important to understand the revolutionary impact of data and digital technologies. There is a growing demand for smart building solutions from which the HVACR industry can benefit. Integration with other building systems such as lighting and security offers opportunities for improved energy management occupant comfort and overall building performance.

Digital technologies give building operators a comprehensive suite of apps to monitor and improve energy efficiency tenant satisfaction asset performance maintenance operations space performance and ultimately the comfort of all occupants. Additionally as climate disclosures become mandatory for many building managers digital services leverage data collection to assess the carbon footprint of the building track progress toward decarbonization goals and provide clear reporting on emissions and building performance.

Regulatory Changes: R-410A & A2L

What does the regulatory landscape look like?

The American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act which mandates an 85% reduction in hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) gases by 2036 has remained top-of-mind for contractors dealers and manufacturers alike. The initial phase of the policy had a negligible impact on refrigerant availability but the next phase — taking effect in January 2024 — dictates the most significant step-down to date and will reduce HFC production by 30%.

This next phase is poised to create a significant impact on the availability of common HVACR refrigerants including R-410A. However contractors and dealers who prepare now can minimize disruptions and the risk of stranded equipment. All involved parties must understand the safe handling storage and transportation of mildly flammable (A2L) refrigerants and have a plan in place for R-410A recovery and reclamation.

Ensuring all levels of the industry are educated informed and empowered will help make the transition as successful and seamless as possible but it remains a pressing issue for the industry at large.

How are organizations prioritizing sustainability?

As sustainability becomes a global corporate mandate organizations are making bold commitments to decarbonize building operations and conserve resources. In a recent study1 conducted in conjunction with Forrester Research 2348 business leaders were surveyed to better understand how organizations are prioritizing and investing in sustainability. The survey revealed that 80% of respondents cited implementing or maturing sustainability efforts as their top priority and for most 2024 was the target date for achieving these goals.

Are there other pressing issues facing HVACR right now?

Indoor air quality receives significant attention due to its impact on occupant health and well-being. Ensuring optimal IAQ requires advanced air filtration ventilation and air purification technologies as well as regular maintenance and adherence to industry standards.

For many building professionals simply enhancing or replacing the HVACR system may not be enough to bolster occupant confidence and satisfaction. Smart building technologies that utilize occupant-facing apps make building data transparently available and enable communication with facility personnel about building and room conditions such as temperature lighting and occupancy.

Preparing for a Successful Year

In 2024 regulatory changes sustainability and new technology will continue to influence the HVACR industry. HVACR professionals who understand and plan for changes while balancing consumer demands are best positioned for success. And together as an industry we can move closer to a world that is built on smart healthy and sustainable buildings.

JPM,JPMorgan Chase,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmpwbW9yZ2FuY2hhc2UuY29tL25ld3Mtc3Rvcmllcy9oZWxwaW5nLWRyaXZlLXByb2dyZXNzLWluLWNhcmJvbi1yZW1vdmFsc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Advancing Carbon Removals: Q&A with JPMorgan Chase's Taylor Wright,"JPMorgan Chase is seeking to both support the development of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies and strengthen the voluntary carbon market. Tell us about your role at JPMorgan Chase and your work on both initiatives?

In my role I’m focused on implementing strategies to reduce the environmental impact of our day-to-day operations including from our corporate offices retail branches and data centers. We have set a number of targets to help drive down our greenhouse gas (GHG) footprint including a goal to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 40 percent by 2030 over a 2017 baseline.

While we continue to prioritize efforts to reduce our operational emissions on an ongoing basis we also purchase voluntary carbon credits to address unabated Scope 1 Scope 2 or Scope 3 business travel emissions annually. We believe it is in the interest of all companies to pursue efforts to avoid reduce and/or neutralize emissions in their own operations and across their value chains—in that order—and that carbon credits should not be used to unreasonably forestall or supplant these efforts. However carbon credits can play an important role in both complementing such efforts and accelerating the overall transition to a low-carbon economy.

As a large financial institution we set high standards and conduct extensive due diligence contributing to both the overall demand for and the advancement of best practices for evaluating high-quality credits. In addition to purchasing credits as part of our efforts to address our own operational emissions the firm also provides strategic advice to support clients’ transition efforts enhances liquidity through credit trading connects buyers and sellers and deploys capital to promote decarbonization solutions.

There are many ways in which the financial industry can play a role in helping to scale solutions to address the climate crisis and drive economic growth. In what way does your work at JPMorgan Chase make an impact in communities in which they operate or serve?

At JPMorgan Chase we strive to help companies that are building innovative climate solutions grow and scale faster. As one of the world’s largest financial institutions JPMorgan Chase participates in the voluntary carbon market in a variety of ways—both as part of our own carbon management strategy and in support of our clients’ efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy.

In May 2023 to help speed and scale the growth and development of CDR technologies JPMorgan Chase announced that it signed long-term agreements to purchase over $200 million in high-quality durable CDR. These agreements are intended to remove and store 800000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (mtCO₂e).

As part of these agreements we’re working with a variety of companies that are developing innovative technologies to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. I had the pleasure of visiting one of the companies we work with Charm Industrial earlier this year. I was impressed with their vision for making an impact on the climate while also having a positive impact in the communities where they operate. It’s this kind of innovation that can help the world achieve its climate goals while continuing to support the economy by bringing job opportunities to agricultural and rural communities.

Looking ahead what do you see as the greatest challenges in the carbon management space?

Over the past two decades tremendous efforts have been made to establish and grow an effective voluntary carbon market and it has enabled considerable investment in climate solutions. However as decarbonization accelerates across the global economy we anticipate that demand for carbon credits will continue to increase as will the need to further grow and strengthen the market to meet that demand.

For this to happen several significant and interrelated challenges need to be addressed including quality supply market integrity market complexity/fragmentation and market maturity. JPMorgan Chase is uniquely positioned to help address these challenges not only through purchasing high-quality carbon credits to address our own emissions but by helping drive the financing of high-integrity carbon projects at scale.

What makes you hopeful for the future?

It has been incredibly inspiring to see the passion for and growth of the carbon removals space to help organizations achieve their own climate goals. I have had the privilege to meet and learn from many people and companies working in this space.

Not only are there many more of them now than there were a few years ago but every sector of the economy is beginning to express interest in this space as well. This enthusiasm passion expertise and willingness to collaborate to solve a really complex problem is a promising sign for advancing a more sustainable future.

The customer who lives in Hawaii says he opened his Chase account two decades ago and was shocked to learn $200000 was suddenly inaccessible reports the US Sun.

According to the customer Chase told him he’d have to visit a branch in person to try and get his money.

And although Chase has ATMs in Hawaii it does not have any physical branches which forced the customer to fly 2400 miles to Los Angeles in an attempt to resolve the issue.

“I don’t know why… I’ve had no problem with them for the last 20 years… But ok it’s their choice and nothing I can do.”

As for why his account was shut down without warning the account holder says he believes a large Zelle transfer may have something to do with it.

In the US banks can close accounts at their discretion for a number of reasons including concerns about fraud and illegal activities too many overdrafts or dormancy.

Banks typically send notices to account holders and mail checks for the balance to addresses on file.

When banks are concerned about potential fraud they also file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) to law enforcement.

Banks filed about 830000 SARs in 2014 a number that steadily increased to about 1.4 million in 2021 according to the Banking Policy Institute.

Only 4% of SARs trigger a follow-up from authorities and a small fraction of the follow-ups result in arrests and convictions.

If you want to skip our introduction to the world's biggest bank in terms of assets its latest performance and other details then check out JP Morgan's Top 5 Stock Picks for 2023.

JPMorgan is a banking giant. According to Insider Monkey's research the bank had $3.74 trillion in total assets as of June 2023 which made it the biggest private bank in the world. Not a small achievement JPMorgan's presence spans all over the world and particularly America and its retail and investment banking divisions are divided across two arms. Chase Bank is the retail division of JPMorgan and its corporate investment banking and wealth management divisions for the super rich are managed through J.P. Morgan.

When compared to some other banks such as the embattled The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS) JPMorgan has had a rock star of a year in 2023 financially. Its shares trading under JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) are up by a respectable 13% year to date which significantly outpaces the S&P Banks Select Industry Index's -11.99% returns year to date. So why is JPMorgan the star of the banking industry in 2023? Well for starters it has been posting solid earnings which are perhaps one of the biggest catalysts to a company's share price. JPMorgan's third quarter financials revealed that the bank's revenue grew by 22% annually to sit at $39.9 billion and its profits posted a 35% annual growth to sit at $13.2 billion. At the heart of its revenue growth are the record high interest rates in the U.S. right now with JPMorgan's net interest income beating analyst estimates during the quarter to touch a sizeable $22.9 billion.

A dominating presence in the financial industry also provides JPMorgan employees with a unique insight into the corporate world. The bank's analysts regularly cover thousands of stocks to assign them ratings and share price targets. We've been regular followers of JPMorgan here at Insider Monkey as well and as 2023 kicked off we took a look at JPMorgan’s Best Performing 15 Stock Picks for 2023. This showed that the top five performing stocks back then were Peloton Interactive Inc. (NASDAQ:PTON) Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Wizz Air Holdings Plc (LON:WIZZ.L) and ChargePoint Holdings Inc. (NYSE:CHPT). So the next thing to ask when evaluating just how good the analysts at JPMorgan are is how the shares performed as 2023 bids us farewell.

Story continues

Well the year to date share price performance of the five companies is -32% 114.96% 168.59% -1% and -77.78%. This shows that when it comes to stocks at least when we limit our attention to only five companies then JPMorgan's top stock picks can deliver outstanding triple digit percentage returns and yet also drop considerably. On a side note this is also a perfect example of why portfolio diversification is also recommended as it helps investors limit the impact of one stock on their portfolios.

Shifting gears JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon who's also often rumored to be running for President has been at the center of a lot of media coverage as of late. This is because Mr. Dimon announced through JPMorgan that he would sell his shares for the first time since he took over the reins in 2005. The JPMorgan boss owned 8.6 million shares as of October 2023 - the date of the announcement - and using JPMorgan's current share price of $152.82 shows that he's worth a cool $1.3 billion. Running the biggest bank in the world comes with its own set of perks and privileges and being a billionaire is one of them.

The tail end of 2024 has also created some hope in the stock market that high rates might start to come down soon. High rates also affect investment banking and if you're wondering what JPMorgan is seeing in this area then here's what the firm's chief financial officer Mr. Jeremy Barnum had to say during its latest earnings call:

I mean as you know obviously the current levels in Investment Banking remain quite depressed certainly relative to the very elevated levels that we saw during the pandemic but even relative to sort of 2019 which is what you might consider the last normal year. We do eventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels recognizing that by the time it happens you will have had many years of economic growth in the meantime. And to be fair while the current environment is a little bit complicated in mix and there are some headwinds as you pointed out things have improved a little bit. And I think I would say our banking team is a little bit more optimistic than they were last quarter. So it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum but obviously significant uncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds given lower levels of announced M&A and some regulatory headwinds on that side.

So as cautious optimism starts to make its way at JPMorgan we took a look at its top stock picks with some notable names being Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

On the beautiful morning of June 17 2023 I attended the undergraduate commencement ceremony in the University’s Stevens Stadium celebrating the graduation of 1590 members of the Class 2023. Among them 54 students were accounting majors and 13 A&IS majors. It has been a long time especially after the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic since I witnessed first-hand the joy and excitement of our graduates. As President Sullivan told the students “The relationships you have formed with each other and with Santa Clara University are not just pleasant byproducts of your four years of college. They truly are the cornerstone of your Santa Clara experience.” We wish our graduates the best luck as they take the next step in their journey.

In 2023 we are celebrating the Leavey School of Business Centennial. From 1923 when the College of Commerce and Finance was first formed to the School of Business in the 1960s and to the Leavey School of Business we have today the School has been committed to educating principled and innovative leaders. Looking ahead to the future the School is launching the Leavey PLUS Initiative by focusing on partnerships leadership unity and sustainability to ensure that our graduates are prepared to be a community of changemakers.

Beginning in September 2023 our Accounting and Information Systems majors have received a STEM (science technology engineering and mathematics) designation. A STEM designation formally recognizes how our A&IS program educates students in information technological aspects of the accounting field and further enhances our reputation in the workplace that increasingly places an emphasis on greater analytical and information technology skills. Eligible international A&IS students with a STEM designation can apply to extend their 12 months of optional practical training for an additional 24 months after graduation.

Professor Jane Ou retired at the end of the school year after her amazing 39 years of service at SCU. She joined Santa Clara in 1984 after receiving her Ph.D. from UC Berkeley. Born in Taiwan Professor Ou received her B.A. in International Business from National Taiwan University. She has taught both financial and managerial accounting classes and received many teaching awards recognizing her commitment to teaching excellence and genuine care for her students. Professor Ou is best known for a series of research papers on financial statement analysis and the role of accounting information in equity valuation. Her coauthored work with Steve Penman won the 1991 AICPA/AAA Notable Contribution to the Accounting Literature Award. We are immensely grateful for what she has contributed to the department and will miss her as a wonderful colleague an outstanding teacher and scholar and a dear friend.

In 2023 the Accounting Department earned the No. 26 spot for the best accounting program out of over 500 universities in the US News & World Report of Best Colleges Rankings. Many of our students were recognized for their outstanding achievements. For example Tammy Ngo an A&IS major received the prestigious scholarship from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) Scholars Program. Bethany Candler an accounting major with a real estate minor won the Jerry Kasner Outstanding Accounting Award from the Silicon Valley Chapter of the California Society of CPAs (CalCPA). These achievements attest to the quality and success of our program in developing well-rounded and well-prepared students.

In AY 2022-23 the Accounting Department created a new Leadership Series program. Hosted by Dean’s Executive Professor Chris Paisley this program provides an exciting opportunity for business students to meet executives in the industry who are SCU accounting alumni. This program has two components: a fireside chat with the guest speaker and a dinner with a select group of accounting and A&IS students. Six speakers joined us in the first year of the Leadership Series including Jack Lazar ’87 former CFO of GoPro and board members of Box Global Foundries Resideo and thredUP Joe Allanson ’85 EVP of Finance and ESG at Salesforce Judy Bruner ’86 former EVP and CFO of SanDisk and former CFO of Palm Inc. Lewis Chew ’84 former CFO of Dolby Laboratories and National Semiconductor Ken Miller ’93 EVP and CFO of Juniper Networks and Betsy Rafael ’83 former Chief Transformation Officer at GoDaddy and former Controller and Principal Accounting Officer at Apple. These speakers shared their personal anecdotes and leadership advice which were greatly appreciated by the attending students.

This year we are excited to start an Accounting Young Alumni Board that is comprised of a diverse group of accounting professionals who provide career mentorship development and networking opportunities to current students and promote broader engagement with the SCU young alumni community. Through strategic outreach and programming the Young Alumni Board aims to build a diverse and rich network of connections and advisers for young accounting and A&IS alumni and students.

The accounting faculty continues to be exemplary teacher-scholars. Professor Chris Paisley was recognized as one of the “Favorite Business Professors of the Class of 2022” in the Poets and Quants for Undergraduates. Research of our faculty has appeared in prestigious journals including The Accounting Review Contemporary Accounting Research and Journal of International Accounting Research. In September 2023 we welcomed our newest member of faculty Dr. Vincent Zhang who graduated with a Ph.D. in accounting from Duke University. Dr. Zhang is a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) and a Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) certified sustainability professional and worked as an auditor at PWC in China.

In closing I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to all of you who generously contribute time and financial support to our program. Your support is critical to our ability to tract high quality students and faculty and it enables us to foster strong bond with our employers and professional community. I look forward to another great year!",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlaHBjLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEyL2hwZS1hbm5vdW5jZXMtZ2VuYWktY29sbGFib3JhdGlvbi13aXRoLW52aWRpYS1haS1uYXRpdmUtYXJjaGl0ZWN0dXJlLWFuZC1oeWJyaWQtY2xvdWQtc29sdXRpb25zL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HPE Announces GenAI Collaboration with NVIDIA AI-native Architecture and Hybrid Cloud Solutions - High ...,"HPE said its GreenLake for File Storage increases performance density and throughput for demanding AI workloads.

Keurig has dominated the segment in the U.S. The company's U.S. coffee sales were about $4.3 billion at the end of last year and it says it had machines installed in more than 38 million households.

Nestlé's Nespresso meanwhile has had more success around the world in a global retail coffee market that the Swiss food and beverage giant says is valued at about $100 billion. Now it's gaining a bigger share of the U.S. market.

""Nespresso has always been a very minority pod system in the United States. If you look globally Keurig has almost no presence outside of North America. So the U.S. is a very anomalous market overall because of that"" said Matthew Barry food and beverage insights manager at Euromonitor International.

Nestlé declined to give CNBC its current household penetration for Nespresso but JPMorgan estimates that Nespresso posted $1.5 billion in U.S. sales last year.

It's a far cry from the brand's origins in the country. It took about seven years for Nespresso's U.S. business to become profitable after Nestlé introduced it in the early 1990s said Jean-Paul Gaillard Nespresso's CEO from 1988 to 1998.

The brand struggled to gain traction with U.S. consumers until 2014 when it changed its approach with the Vertuo machine. It brews full-size coffees in addition to the brand's signature espresso options. Before it rolled out the machine Nespresso's sales were $300 million in 2013.

""I think that's where you saw this tremendous shift"" said Alfonso Gonzalez Loeschen Nespresso's CEO for North America.

Nespresso's rise comes after the Keurig system took the U.S. by storm a decade ago. The company grew its domestic coffee sales by nearly $3 billion in the four-year span between 2009 and 2013.

Nespresso's gain may not necessarily be Keurig's loss. Euromonitor's Barry said the brand may be aiming for a different part of the market than its rival and is ""not really trying to dethrone Keurig.""

Keurig also thinks it still has room to grow.

""There's still over 50 million households left in the U.S. coffee market that we look at and say 'how do we meet the needs of those users?'"" said Patrick Minogue president of U.S. coffee for Keurig Dr Pepper.

Schweppe's may have created the first carbonated mineral water in 1783 but it would be another 80 years before companies began adding other flavors to the fizzy concoction. After Vernor's Ginger Ale was produced in the 1860s other soda companies began creating their own new and unique flavors. For many people it comes down to Pepsi vs. Coke but if you look at all the different regional sodas it becomes much more complex. The rest of the country may not know what Moxie soda is but New Englanders love it. The same goes for Texas-based Big Red.

While many Texans would love to make Big Red the state's national drink even those who love it have trouble explaining the flavor. On a Reddit thread the suggestions are all over the place. ""If you took cinnamon flavored gum and mixed it with cotton candy then diluted it"" suggested one fan. ""I agree with the bubble gum taste. I've heard some people say red vines"" said another.

Many people also assume that the red color is cherry or some sort of berry but it's just red dye. Big Red gets its flavor from the vanilla used in traditional cream soda mixed with citrus oils.

Originally It Was Only Sold In Texas

Big Red flavors - Facebook

Big Red was founded by Grover C. Thomsen and R.H. Roark in Waco Texas in 1937. Originally called Sun Tang Big Red Cream Soda it was shortened after hearing someone refer to it as 'Big Red.' Current flavors include the original Big Red Big Red Zero Sugar Big Blue Big Peach and Big Pineapple. It may not be as well-known as Coca-Cola Pepsi Dr Pepper or Mountain Dew but it's popular enough that it appears to have earned a copycat.

H-E-B Wild Red Soda may not be the brand name but as far as store-brand sodas go this knockoff has its fans. Slightly sweeter and with a more distinct cream soda taste it has won over some who prefer this drink over the original. ""Can't count the number of times someone has said 'Why is your Sprite so good' or 'I don't remember Big Red being so good'"" remarked one big fan on Reddit.

For decades Big Red was only sold in Texas but ever since Dr Pepper Snapple (which has since become Keurig Dr Pepper) bought a stake in the company in 2008 it broadened the distribution. This means Big Red has begun showing up in stores all around the country giving people the chance to decide for themselves exactly what it tastes like.

With inflation easing and the Fed expected to cut interest rates as soon as May next year the demand for consumer goods will likely grow.

Amid this favorable backdrop it could be wise to consider investing in fundamentally strong consumer stocks such as The Procter & Gamble Company (PG) and Kimberly-Clark Corporation (KMB). However not all consumer goods stocks will likely gain from rising consumer spending and easing inflation. Peloton Interactive Inc. (PTON) is expected to underperform because of its fundamental weakness and thus is best avoided now.

Before delving deeper into the fundamentals of the three stocks let’s take a closer look at why the consumer goods industry is worth looking at now.

The Consumer Price Index (CPI) barely changed in October with a 3.2% increase from a year ago down from the 3.7% rise in September. Inflation is down significantly from last year’s 9.1% peak in June. Meanwhile core CPI hit a two-year low annually. Core CPI showed an increase of 0.2% sequentially and 4% year-over-year both coming below analyst estimates.

With inflation easing and the Fed expected to start cutting rates next year confidence in the consumer industry’s growth has been boosted. U.S. consumer confidence rose in November after three straight months of sequential declines. The consumer confidence index rose to 102.0 in November.

Consumer spending has also been robust so far despite the macroeconomic challenges. Consumer spending rose 0.2% in October while personal income increased 0.2%.

The consumer goods industry is reaping the benefits of technology. AI has transformed the consumer goods industry improving supply chain inventory demand prediction marketing and customer service.

Carr | News Sports Jobs,"MUNISING MI- Ruth M. Carr of Munising died peacefully in her sleep at the age of 102 early in the morning of Tuesday November 28 2023. She was born on October 16 1921 in Munising Michigan to William and Elizabeth (Hebert) LaFave. Ruth graduated from Sacred Heart School and is the last surviving member of the Wm. G. Mather Class of 1939. She briefly worked at Kimberly Clark and then Ruth served in the Women’s Army Corps as a medical technician during WWII. She was proud of her service and the care she gave to the wounded soldiers on American soil at O’Reilly General Hospital in Missouri. Ruth returned to Munising and married John Carr in 1947 and together they raised their family. She was a lifetime member of Sacred Heart Church.

She was a very busy homemaker and enjoyed baking pickling and gardening. Ruth had a great love for the outdoors and enjoyed hunting fishing and especially berry picking. She once picked all around a patch of berries with a wasp’s nest in the center! On hot summer afternoons she could be found walking to the beach at Bay Furnace with a string of neighborhood children in tow. Ruth loved the UP and one of her favorite activities was driving around the county and exploring the woods with her husband John and later her children. She took good care of her health and loved to walk. Until her mobility declined she visited the beaches and boardwalks of Alger County frequently often in the company of a close friend. Ruth enjoyed playing games and cards with family and friends and continued to beat her opponents in cribbage up until her death.

She is survived by her children – Susan (Lee) Rosenbaum of Portland OR John (Trina) Carr of Christmas MI and Lori (Ken) Mitchell of Forest Grove OR; grandchildren – Rachel Rosenbaum (Dominic Brown) David Rosenbaum and Arthur (Paola) Oas; sister-in-law – Norma LaFave; and numerous nieces and nephews. Ruth was preceded in death by her parents husband John Carr in 1977 infant daughter Mary Ruth Carr in 1954 and siblings – Derilda Tussing Exilda Theaker Dorothy Swajanen Jean Paananen infant twins Robert “Mogie” Lawrence “Stowe” Ernie “Shorty” and Jack LaFave: Parents-in-law – Louis and Francis Carr In-laws – Lud (Helen) Carr Louie (Vera) Carr Frank (Irma) Carr Josephine (Warren) Petterson Mary Carr Sylvia (Bob) Bartol and Antonia Carr.

A Memorial Mass will be celebrated by Father Michael Ocran on Thursday December 7 2023 at 10:00 a.m. at Sacred Heart Church in Munising. Interment will be in 2024 at the Maple Grove Cemetery where the Alger County Veterans Honor Guard will render military honors for Alger County’s oldest veteran.

(NYSE:KMI) is heavily dominated by institutional owners,"Key Insights

Significantly high institutional ownership implies Kinder Morgan's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions

The top 25 shareholders own 50% of the company

13% of Kinder Morgan is held by insiders

Every investor in Kinder Morgan Inc. (NYSE:KMI) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 64% ownership. In other words the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.

In the chart below we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Kinder Morgan.

See our latest analysis for Kinder Morgan

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Kinder Morgan?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

Kinder Morgan already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Kinder Morgan's historic earnings and revenue below but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Kinder Morgan. Our data suggests that Richard Kinder who is also the company's Top Key Executive holds the most number of shares at 12%. When an insider holds a sizeable amount of a company's stock investors consider it as a positive sign because it suggests that insiders are willing to have their wealth tied up in the future of the company. For context the second largest shareholder holds about 7.8% of the shares outstanding followed by an ownership of 6.8% by the third-largest shareholder.

A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 25 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.

Story continues

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of Kinder Morgan

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Kinder Morgan Inc.. Insiders own US$4.9b worth of shares in the US$39b company. That's quite meaningful. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders especially in a company of this size. You can click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public-- including retail investors -- own 24% stake in the company and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership while considerable may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company there are other factors that are even more important. For example we've discovered 2 warning signs for Kinder Morgan (1 is significant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.
