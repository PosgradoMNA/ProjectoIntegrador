City Attorney Palmer Davis told commissioners on Friday that Lakeland could receive about $1.1 million from DuPont and $13.5 million from 3M as part of a $13.6 billion settlement tentatively approved by the U.S. District Court in Charleston S.C.

The money would be set aside for future efforts to detect and remove chemicals known as PFAS (perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances) from the city’s water supply — although actual remediation costs are likely to be far higher than the payout.

“The way the settlement agreements are structured you’re in the class unless you opt out” Davis explained. The deadlines to request exclusion are Dec. 4 for DuPont and Dec. 11 for 3M.

Davis said Lakeland’s share of the settlement is a “rough estimate” based on allocation tables that factor in the amount of contamination and volume of water. If Lakeland accepts the settlement it cannot sue again later based on new findings.

Several cities have criticized the settlement offer as inadequate and premature saying there’s not enough information about the scope of the problem or the potential costs of addressing it. At least a dozen have opted out to reserve the right to pursue their own claims later. They include: Fort Worth; Portland Ore.; Myrtle Beach Columbia and Lexington S.C.; LaGrange Ga.; Hastings Minn.

“If you opt out of the class you’d have to maintain your own litigation against 3M and DuPont so you’d be engaging in highly complex litigation against international companies” Davis told the commissioners.

The settlement agreement was reached just as the case was about to go to trial after a five-year legal battle that involved 7.4 million pages of discovery documents and 160 depositions.

“It makes a lot more sense to stay in than opt out so that’s my recommendation to you” Davis said. In addition to the expense of pursuing a case he said: “There’s definitely talk that both of these companies may file for bankruptcy. If you’re part of the class you’re a protected creditor. If you go it alone then you’re on your own and you may not get anything.”

An ‘urgent public health issue’

For many decades PFAS chemicals were used to make industrial and consumer products including firefighting foam nonstick cookware grease-resistant food packaging and stain- and water-repellant carpets upholstery and fabrics. This included products labeled Teflon and Scotchguard.

In the “PFAS Strategic Roadmap” for 2021-2024 EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan wrote: “As the science has continued to develop we know more now than ever about how PFAS build up in our bodies over long periods of time and how they can cause adverse health effects that can devastate families.”

Over time researchers have discovered several alarming things:

PFAS chemicals don’t break down in the environment or do so extremely slowly hence the nickname “forever chemicals.”

They’ve been found in air surface water groundwater soil fish and the blood of people and animals all over the world — including Antarctica and the Tibetan plateau.

Exposure has been linked with a variety of health risks including prostate kidney and testicular cancers; decreased fertility; immune disorders; developmental delays and hormone disruption in children; liver and thyroid problems; and increased cholesterol.

In 2016 the Environmental Protection Agency set a “health advisory” guideline for two of the chemicals: PFOA and PFOS. The levels were set at no more than 70 parts per trillion combined in drinking water.

Earlier this year the EPA dramatically lowered the acceptable levels setting the “lifetime health advisory level” for PFOA at .004 parts per trillion and PFOS at .02 parts per trillion. It also established levels for two other PFAS chemicals. Water utilities must report levels of 4 parts per trillion or more.

The EPA has also advised that national legally enforceable drinking water standards are coming with limits for six PFAS compounds and requirements to monitor 29 PFAS compounds.

The challenge for Lakeland

While PFAS have been found in Lakeland’s water the city is within the EPA’s recommended standards — for now Water Production Manager Joe Costine told commissioners Friday.

Lakeland currently gets its water from 19 wells drilled into the Floridan aquifer. The raw water is delivered to two treatment centers where it is softened with lime and disinfected with chlorine: the C. Wayne Combee Plant and the T. B. Williams Plant.

Costine said there are two generally accepted methods to remove PFAS from drinking water: granular activated carbon filtration or reverse osmosis. Lakeland is not presently using either process at its two treatment plants.

“They’re expensive to set up … but the biggest problem is not necessarily the cost of treatment; it’s actually the cost of disposal” Costine explained. “Because then you’ve concentrated a hazardous chemical.” He said the only current method of disposal is incineration at 4000 degrees Fahrenheit and “not just any incinerator can handle that.”

One Florida city that has started removing PFAS from its water is Stuart which is expecting to get more than $100 million from the class action settlement. In 2016 Stuart discovered that the levels in its water supply exceeded federal guidelines. It closed its 24 wells and built an $18.3 million reverse osmosis treatment facility. Costine said Stuart has been shipping the PFAS concentrates by barge across the Gulf of Mexico to an incinerator in Texas.

Testing methods are evolving but Costine said because the amounts are thousandths of parts per trillion it is difficult to know precisely how much PFAS is in the water. Also there are more than 14000 known PFAS compounds but current guidelines only address six.

He said Lakeland will likely have to invest in remediation in the future but abatement processes may also improve and become more accessible.

“Hopefully the regulations will not be too burdensome on us once they pass” Davis said.

Settlement won’t be enough but alternatives are grim

A fact sheet put together by attorneys who brokered the settlements noted that the 3M and DuPont settlements alone won’t be enough to clean up the nation’s water supply.

“The anticipated cost of PFAS drinking water clean-up exceeds the market cap of all potentially liable defendants” the fact sheet says. “It is estimated that it would cost approximately $100 billion or more to address the nation’s PFAS contamination. Finding funding sufficient to address a problem of this magnitude will require more than one funding source.”

The fact sheet says the class action settlements could be combined with other funding sources including about $9 billion earmarked by the federal government for PFAS cleanup.

If municipalities opt out of the settlement the attorneys caution “That will set them back years since they would need to relitigate the issues that the settlements would otherwise resolve and further there is no guaranteed outcome.”

“By contrast the settlements remove litigation risk and will provide funds starting in 2024 so (public water systems) can begin to fix their PFAS contamination problems quickly” it says.

Additionally if too many water systems “seek their own trials or a larger payday 3M and DuPont will have no choice but to exercise their right to terminate the settlements and might well seek bankruptcy protection. If that were to occur (municipalities) would be forced to wait years for the bankruptcy court to sort out all of the defendants’ creditors and water systems could end up with pennies on the dollar at best.”

Lakeland commissioners did not formalize their decision Friday because they cannot vote during agenda study sessions but most seemed to agree with Davis’ recommendation.

There is a City Commission meeting on Monday.

Back in the early 2000s Ziomek Wiertelak found himself working on a house in Highgate north London. Young and ambitious Ziomek was building up his own construction company and was deeply taken with the wide tree-lined street by Hampstead Heath.

“I brought my family to see the house I was doing and I said to them: ‘One day we will live here’” he said.

True to his word in 2013 Ziomek paid almost £3m for a house on his dream street. And then he razed it to the ground.

Buying a house just to knock it down sounds like a counterintuitive move like buying a car and then deliberately crashing it.

But Ziomek 51 was aware that well-located building sites are hard if not impossible to come by. If he wanted his dream home on his ideal street it was his only option.

“I know that if you refurbish a house you have got limitations. If you want to do it your way it has to be a new build” he said.

There are also significant planning advantages to buying land with an existing building on it.

The 1970s-built house that Ziomek bought was small and badly designed. “It was built by somebody very cheaply using the cheapest materials you could buy” he said.

If Ziomek had been able to find an empty plot it would he admits have been preferable because he would have been spared the expense of a demolition. “But there are no empty plots like this in prime London” he said.

And while he took a gamble by investing a seven-figure sum on a house he didn’t want without planning permission to replace it experience told him that the local planners would be amenable to getting rid of the old house if he could offer them something better.

“It was a very awful house” he said.

Once the house had been reduced to a pile of rubble Ziomek was left with a blank canvas measuring around 200ft by 100ft.

With planning permission in place he set to work on a three-year project to replace the old house with a 6680 sq ft double-fronted home. The multi-award winning modern property built in a mix of brick glass and concrete was designed by architects Cousins & Cousins.

Story continues

Not all teardown projects are deliberate strategies. When Mark Roberts bought his house on the other side of London in 2009 his plan was to live in it.

Admittedly the modernist 1950s house in Sydenham southeast London had seen better days so Mark knew he was going to have to do some work on the £310000 property.

“We went a long way down the road of saving the house but as we got more and more radical about what we wanted to remove the structural engineer said: ‘Just knock it down and start again’” said Mark. “We realised it would be cheaper to do it that way.”

Back in 2009 Mark an engineer was living in Milan with his wife – the couple now also have a daughter 13.

Their block-built detached house had some serious shortcomings. “The windows were not great and the insulation was not great but it had been built by an architect to live in and I did like it” said Mark 56.

With a blank canvas to work on architects Paul Archer Design created a pared-down geometric open-plan family home.

The old house measured a compact 1220 sq ft. The new home measures just over 1800 sq ft and cost around £217 per sq ft to build. In 2016 the family was able to move in after a year-long build.

Looking back Mark has no regrets about his pivot from saving the house to demolishing it. “I would not have found an empty site like this with a garden and neighbours on either side” he said. “And it is a strange quirk of London that land is much more valuable than the house built on it.”

Beyond London Emma Goddard had long dreamed of building a modern home on her family farm near Downton in Wiltshire. But since the area is located between Cranborne Chase and the New Forest – both classed as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty – she knew that getting planning permission was going to be tricky.

Emma 46 and her husband Tariq 48 decided their best hope was to replace an existing house on the farm – a cold damp and dismal-looking pebbledash 1940s bungalow originally built for farm workers – with their dream family home.

“I don’t think we would have got permission to do it any other way” said Emma who helps manage the farm and also works as a sustainability manager.

The couple hired Western Design Architects to draw up plans for the house and steer them through the planning system - Russell Sach

The couple hired Western Design Architects to draw up plans for the house and steer them through the planning system.

Happily planners tend to be willing to allow replacement buildings so long as they are a similar shape and size as the original and the bungalow’s extravagantly pitched roof was on the couple’s side.

Their steel-framed timber-clad two-storey house is actually slightly lower than the bungalow. And they were given some latitude to diverge from the original footprint. “The new house is slightly longer but not as wide” said Emma.

The 2239 sq ft house took nine months to build at a cost of £500000. Emma Tariq an author and publisher and their sons Titus nine and Spike 11 moved in in 2019.

As an environmentalist Emma did have some concerns about tearing down – rather than restoring – an existing house but concluded there was little about the bungalow worth saving.

And since it is powered with solar panels and a heat pump she is comforted by the knowledge that the sustainability credentials of her new house are strong.

The S&P 500 is the benchmark for the investing world. This well-known index comprises 500 of the largest and most visible corporations in the United States the world's leading economy.

It's also a great hunting ground for phenomenal long-term stock ideas to fit any investing strategy. Dividend investors are a large group with a specific investing strategy buying stocks that will help them build large income streams from dividends. Many of these dividend enthusiasts rely on these five generous dividend-paying S&P 500 stocks for their huge payouts.

Let's find out a bit more about these five stocks.

1. Altria Group

American tobacco giant Altria Group (MO 0.71%) has made millions for shareholders over the past century selling Marlboro cigarettes in the United States. The company's golden years are far behind it now that the general public is better informed about the dangers of smoking. Still the addictive properties of nicotine give Altria the pricing power to continue growing profits despite smoking rates declining since the 1960s.

Cigarettes are cheap to manufacture so the company has few operating expenses. Most of Altria's profits go to shareholders as dividends. The company's dividend payout ratio is roughly 80% of cash flow. Altria's raised the dividend 58 times over the past 54 years meaning investors are getting paid more over time. Shares offer a generous 9.3% dividend yield at today's share price.

2. AbbVie

Pharmaceuticals are a lucrative industry especially if the company manages to develop a blockbuster drug. Patents protect proprietary formulas from competition for several years and allow the company to benefit from its development efforts. AbbVie (ABBV -0.25%) was a significant benefactor for several years from the success of Humira the world's top-selling drug. Unfortunately its patent protection expired recently. But don't worry; the company used its Humira profits to build the rest of the company into a juggernaut and it has several other drugs ready or in development to take up the slack.

AbbVie has become a favorite among dividend investors. Not only is the yield juicy at 4.5% but the payout has also grown by an average of 17% annually over the past decade. The dividend payout ratio is still manageable at 42% of cash flow so investors could see a nice one-two combo of yield and dividend growth moving forward.

3. Verizon Communications

Virtually everyone in America has a cellphone or smartphone. The importance of smartphones to consumers' everyday lives has made telecommunications companies like Verizon Communications (VZ) more like utility companies. People seemingly pay their phone bills as religiously as their water or electricity. This creates steady revenue streams for Verizon which results in fertile ground for steady and increasing dividend payments.

Verizon must invest constantly in upgrading and maintaining its wireless network so investors should look at net income instead of cash flow to judge the dividend. Fortunately Verizon spends just half its earnings on the dividend so investors should be in good shape with its 7.1% dividend yield.

4. Philip Morris International

Marlboro is a worldwide brand but Altria only sells it in America. Philip Morris International (PM 0.36%) was spun off from Altria over a decade ago and owns international rights to Marlboro. That shortens its dividend history but Philip Morris has raised its dividend yearly as a public company. That streak currently stands at 15 years. The dividend payout ratio is high at 103% but profits could grow and bring that ratio down over the coming years.

How? Philip Morris has done a great job innovating and moving into growing nicotine categories. It developed IQOS a device that heats (but doesn't burn) tobacco to produce vapor. It also acquired Swedish Match which makes the Zyn brand of oral nicotine pouches. Philip Morris is bringing these opportunities to global markets including America so the stock has long-term growth potential.

5. AT&T

A small group of significant players dominates the U.S. wireless communications market. Verizon is second-largest to AT&T (T -0.17%) which holds a 47% share. Today AT&T is a different company from what it's been for most of the decade. It tried failed and exited the entertainment industry and is now concentrating on telecommunications again. The stock offers a dividend yield of more than 6.8%.

It's not all rosy. The company still carries $138 billion in long-term debt scars from its former entertainment ambitions. However the dividend payout ratio is back to under half of net income after management cut the dividend once to free up more money to pay off its debt. Financially AT&T seems back on its feet giving investors confidence to continue the dividends.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Accenture Philippines special advisor for global accessibility center and inclusion Rudy Guiao Jr. says that more than 3 percent of their current employees in the country are persons with disabilities a number that they are expecting to grow given their current hiring policies.

PWDs are defined as those having difficulty performing day to day activities such as walking communicating hearing or seeing even if wearing glasses.

“We’ve always been saying that we are a very inclusive company. Most of our roles are saying that we are open for (anybody). It’s part of our unwavering commitment to inclusion and diversity” Guaio tells the Inquirer.

Accenture employs more than 79000 people in the Philippines indicating that over 2300 of its workforce in the country are differently abled people.

More than the numbers Guiao says they are looking more at the transformational impact they have on the lives of these people who are often deprived of opportunities in society.

Accessibility center

Back in 2019 Accenture Philippines pioneered and launched its accessibility center in the country as part of the company’s strong commitment to be the most inclusive and diverse employer in the information technology and business process management industry.

The company so far has established 40 of these accessibility centers around the world providing a space where PWDs can interact with accessible technology.

The local unit has expanded the initiative with additional innovative technology for its Filipino employees offering a wide range of assistance for its employees who have disabilities.

These technologies include what they call the “We Walk” a smart cane for the visually impaired that detects above-ground obstacles with ultrasound while still retaining the ground feedback.

The company also has the Virtual Experience for Everyone (IVEE) application which allows employees using sign language to connect and interact with other employees using the English alphabet.

Another initiative is the accessibility center on wheels which provides assistive tools and technology such as headsets talk-to-text keyboards glasses among other equipment to homes of PWD employees.

“Since 80 percent of disabilities are acquired between the ages of 18 and 64 it is crucial that anyone could become a person with disability at any time; there is no us and them” Accenture says in its website.

Adobe's special Black Friday promotion has been extended through Dec. 3 delivering half off the Creative Cloud All Apps plan for your first 12 months.

It's the season for creating with Adobe Creative Cloud thanks to the season's best half off discount on your first year of the All Apps plan.

One of the most-used suites of tools used by professional creatives from photographers to developers Adobe Creative Cloud All Apps comes with an assortment of professional-grade tools to make designs come to life.

The Creative Cloud All Apps Subscription offers 20+ apps plus generative AI tools powered by Adobe Firefly covering most creative fields. Photographers and artists will gravitate towards Photoshop and Lightroom on Mac and their counterparts for iOS and iPadOS.

With the deal the individual Creative Cloud All Apps plan is discounted to $29.98 per month for the first year's subscription down from $59.99 per month.

For students there are even more savings to be had with over 70% off the package.

Both offers are valid now through Dec. 3.

Even more tech sales to save big this holiday season",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAyL2ZvcmdldC1taWNyb3NvZnQtdW5zdG9wcGFibGUtc3RvY2tzLWFkb2JlLXBhbG8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Forget Microsoft: These Are the Unstoppable Stocks to Buy Now,"Two excellent alternatives to the software giant.

Investors have pushed Microsoft (MSFT 0.18%) stock to new highs in recent weeks. The tech giant's share price performance is trouncing the wider market having soared nearly 60% this year. By comparison the Nasdaq Composite gained 36%.

Some investors are concerned that this rally has made Microsoft a less compelling growth stock. It's approaching $3 trillion in market capitalization after all and Wall Street is well aware of its many sales catalysts ahead. These include artificial intelligence (AI) and the rising demand for video games and cybersecurity software in the years to come.

If you'd like exposure to some of these industries but are turned off by Microsoft's elevated valuation there are some good alternatives to consider. Read on for reasons to buy Adobe (ADBE -0.99%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW -0.65%) instead.

Adobe is cashing in on AI

Adobe stock is riding on a wave of enthusiasm about generative AI but it isn't just hype that's elevating investor sentiment in 2023. The software giant is already capitalizing on AI tech that's made its way into products like Photoshop and Premiere Pro. In mid-September Adobe revealed that higher demand across its portfolio has helped push profit to $4.9 billion in the first half of 2023 up from $4.5 billion a year earlier.

Adobe's focus on content creation positions it well to take full advantage of the rising value that AI is delivering. You can see evidence of that excitement in the fact that people have generated 2 billion images using its new Firefly software in just the first six months following its release. Subscription services are rising too contributing to impressive cash-flow trends.

The company is valued at a premium to Microsoft. But growth-stock investors see good reasons to like shares at the current valuation of 15x sales compared to Microsoft's price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 13. Its smaller sales footprint and greater focus on creative content could make Adobe a huge winner in the next era of computing tech.

Palo Alto Networks can keep its momentum

Microsoft offers cybersecurity protection as part of its huge services platform but investors might earn better returns from owning Palo Alto Networks over the next several years. Sure investors were a bit disappointed with the company's earnings update in late November which showed slowing billings trends.

Yet sales were up a healthy 20% in the Q3 period and are on track to rise at nearly the same pace for the full year. Most Wall Street pros are looking for Microsoft to grow at 4% this fiscal year by contrast.

An investment in Palo Alto Networks doesn't offer nearly the same level of diversity and safety that comes along with Microsoft's massive global sales base. You don't get a dividend from owning this cybersecurity business either.

Still investors who value growth will love Palo Alto Networks' expanding market share and its healthy market share in a competitive niche. Management is determined to keep boosting profitability as well building on the excellent momentum that shareholders saw here last year.

As is the case with Adobe you'll pay a higher premium to own Palo Alto right now as compared to late 2022. But for roughly the same price-to-sales valuation as Microsoft you'll get exposure to a leading software-as-a-service provider in an industry that's likely to see fantastic growth over the next several years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMDMvd2hhdC1zdHJvbmctYmxhY2stZnJpZGF5LXJldGFpbC1zYWxlcy1tZWFuLWZvci1ob2xpZGF5LXNwZW5kaW5nLmh0bWzSAWhodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMy8xMi8wMy93aGF0LXN0cm9uZy1ibGFjay1mcmlkYXktcmV0YWlsLXNhbGVzLW1lYW4tZm9yLWhvbGlkYXktc3BlbmRpbmcuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Three reasons a strong Black Friday weekend may not mean a blowout holiday season for retailers,"Shoppers walk around Twelve Oaks Mall on November 24 2023 in Novi Michigan. Emily Elconin | Getty Images

Retailers are cheering after shoppers spent big on gifts and decor in the days after they gobbled up turkey and stuffing. But the strong showing does not necessarily mean those companies will have blowout success in their all-important holiday quarter. Online spending shot up by nearly 8% year over year to $38 billion during the five-day period from Thanksgiving Day to Cyber Monday according to Adobe Analytics. A record high of 200.4 million shoppers went to retailers' stores and websites over the same period according to a survey by the National Retail Federation. And Ulta Beauty and Foot Locker 's shares rose this week after the companies reported better-than-expected earnings and a strong start to holiday spending on sneakers makeup and more. But some unique factors may have driven those early sales including wider adoption of online shopping deeper discounting levels and cooler temperatures in many parts of the U.S. That's raised questions about whether consumers' appetite to spend will continue throughout the critical retail season — or taper off into a more pronounced lull between Black Friday and the final rush before Christmas. Ulta is in one of the hottest categories for retail as beauty continues to defy weaker discretionary spending trends. Yet even Ulta CEO Dave Kimbell was quick to point out this week on the company's earnings call that retail's biggest weeks are ahead. He said Ulta and its beauty competitors will have higher promotional levels than a year ago as they cater to budget-minded customers.

The NRF has tempered expectations too relative to recent years. The industry's major trade group predicts 3% to 4% year-over-year growth in holiday-related spending from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31. That's roughly in line with the average annual growth before the boom of the pandemic years. On a call this week NRF CEO Matt Shay said the season is on track to meet that estimate — even after shoppers blew past the trade group's turnout expectations for the five-day Thanksgiving weekend. Here's a look at three key factors that contributed to Black Friday weekend:

Shoppers flock online

Instead of dashing to the mall after Thanksgiving dinner or lining up outside stores for doorbuster deals on Black Friday morning more Americans are filling up shopping carts from their couches. Online shopping still drives just a fraction of overall holiday spending even after the cooped-up years of the pandemic — giving it plenty of room to grow. About 1 in 5 retail dollars are spent online according to Adobe Analytics. Only about 30% of overall holiday sales last year took place online through apps or in other locations that aren't physical stores according to the NRF. Consumers spent $109.3 billion online from Nov. 1 through Cyber Monday this year according to Adobe Analytics. That's a 7.3% jump compared with the same period last year. It's an even sharper jump from pre-pandemic in 2019. Consumers spent $81.5 billion online during the stretch from Nov. 1 through Cyber Monday that year. The period this year had a few extra days since Thanksgiving was later in 2019 than in 2023 but illustrates the bigger embrace of e-commerce. Adobe's data covers more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail websites 100 million unique items and 18 total product categories. One reason for the shift? Some major retailers that used to draw shoppers on the evening of Thanksgiving are now shut. The closures of Walmart Target Best Buy and other retailers on Thanksgiving is one of the pandemic's legacies. Plus in a year when Americans are more budget-minded online can be the better way to shop said Vivek Pandya a lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights. Comparing prices is easier to do by opening multiple web browsers and apps rather than driving from store to store he said. ""The focus is on price and value and the consumer has been very strategic"" he said. It's too soon to say if the higher online shopping total so far this season means holiday shoppers will spend more overall year over year — or if more of their purchases are just moving to websites and apps. Adobe does not track in-store purchases Pandya said. Adobe predicts that full holiday season online spending from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31 will hit $221.8 billion which would be a nearly 5% year-over-year jump. If the estimate ends up being correct that means shoppers still have a little more than half of their online holiday spending to go. The NRF said this week that its survey found about half of consumers' online and in-store holiday shopping remains.

A hunger for deals

The desire for deals is an early and clear theme of the season. After more than a year of paying higher prices for nearly everything including milk gas and housing U.S. shoppers have shown that a compelling price cut is one of the best motivators. Black Friday and Cyber Monday have become synonymous with deep discounts which may explain the outsized shopper turnout and online spending. On Cyber Monday for instance consumers saw discounts peak at 31% for electronics 27% for toys 23% on apparel and 21% on furniture according to Adobe. Those price cuts in electronics apparel and furniture were higher than Cyber Monday a year ago. Toys on the other hand had lower discounting levels than the last Cyber Monday. Scott Wren senior global market strategist at Wells Fargo said it's a mistake for investors to extrapolate that heightened Black Friday weekend spending means that the American consumer is healthy. Instead he described it as the ""last hurrah"" before a recession that Wells Fargo predicts will take place in the first half of 2024. He said higher credit card balances increased costs of borrowing and the risk that the U.S. Federal Reserve may keep raising interest rates to fight inflation could spur a downturn. ""People are just about tapped out but [with] the holiday season people are willing to even further extend themselves"" he said. Reality may also hit as consumers must pay off those holiday purchases. Americans are financing purchases in new ways along with swiping credit and debit cards. Use of buy now pay later hit an all-time high on Cyber Monday according to Adobe. It contributed $940 million in online spend a nearly 43% jump year over year. Shoppers who used the payment option also put more items in their carts as the number of items purchased rose 11% year over year. Taking on credit card debt this holiday season will come at a steeper price too if consumers carry a balance from month to month because of higher interest rates.

And if you believe the company’s true value is $130.99 then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Advanced Micro Devices’s share price is quite volatile we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.

Can we expect growth from Advanced Micro Devices?

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Advanced Micro Devices' earnings over the next few years are expected to double indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows feeding into a higher share value.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? AMD’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price with shares trading around its fair value. However there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on AMD now may not be the most advantageous time to buy given it is trading around its fair value. However the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

This burgeoning opportunity has sent shares of Nvidia up 230% in 2023 and investors are hopeful that AMD stock which has nearly doubled this year will perform similarly in 2024.

AMD also has a big opportunity on the consumer side with its Ryzen processors so the chipmaker is not lacking for potential growth drivers. That being said management's latest guidance for 2024 leaves some doubt about the stock's upside potential next year.

AMD's CEO is excited about this opportunity

AMD has been taking market share from Intel in recent years and it may have taken more last quarter. While AMD's total revenue grew just 4% year over year in the third quarter client segment revenue grew by 42% year over year and 46% over the second quarter driven by demand for its Ryzen 7000 series central processing units (CPUs).

Many customers who buy Ryzen CPUs are people who play video games on PCs but there could be new categories of customers buying AMD-powered PCs for multitasking video streaming and productivity software. New software applications that take advantage of AI will require even more powerful CPUs.

Within the PC market AMD CEO Lisa Su said she is most excited about the opportunity in PCs designed to support AI-heavy applications. ""I think we're at the beginning of a wave there. We're investing heavily in Ryzen AI and the opportunity to really broaden sort of the AI capabilities of PCs going forward.""

Microsoft has released AI features for Windows such as Bing Chat and Copilot. The arrival of more software like this will serve as a catalyst for long-term growth in AMD's Ryzen CPU business.

How high can AMD stock go in 2024?

Investors are expecting AMD's momentum in CPUs to carry over to the GPU market as AMD launches a new batch of AI GPUs. This is why the stock has climbed 93% this year despite slow growth across the business lately.

However AMD's guidance calls for data center GPU revenue to be just $400 million in the fourth quarter which isn't much. For 2024 the company expects revenue from that part of its business to reach $2 billion compared to total revenue of $26 billion based on analysts' consensus estimate.

AMD's guidance leaves some doubt about the impact its new GPUs will have on near-term growth. But investors may have to be patient here. Over the next four years management expects data center GPU revenue to grow 50% per year. That would result in $10 billion in revenue from that segment by 2027.

Nvidia reported $14 billion in data center revenue last quarter up 279% year over year and that was with a limited supply of GPUs available. Nvidia is working hard to make enough chips to meet demand so there will be plenty of opportunity for two competitors in the data center GPU market.

AMD's offerings will have something different to help them stand out from those of its rival. The new MI300 chips will feature generous quantities of memory bandwidth which is useful in working with massive amounts of data.

Still AMD's near-term guidance is a problem for a stock that is currently more expensive than Nvidia on a forward price-to-earnings basis. Unless AMD blows past its guidance in the coming quarters the stock may have limited upside next year.

If you're thinking of buying shares expecting large gains in 2024 I would be careful. I would only consider buying AMD right now if you plan on holding the stock for at least five years.

AMD previously estimated its long-term addressable market at $300 billion for all chip products in the data center gaming and consumer PC segments. That gives it a long runway for growth and should lead to market-beating returns for patient investors.

Fed Looking at Job Numbers to Gauge Inflation Fight

After another drop in inflation last week market watchers will be looking at a slew of labor market data this week to determine if the job market remains resilient in the face of the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes. The improving inflation figures show that the Fed's rate hikes are having an effect. The next step will be to make sure that the higher-rate environment doesn't affect employment too negatively.

Last month's employment figures also suggested that things were moving in the right direction for the Fed. The October report showed that employers added 150000 jobs over the course of the month about 20000 fewer than economists expected. It followed a hot September jobs report indicating that employers added 297000 jobs which raised worries that continued strength in the labor market would keep inflation elevated. Last month's report also showed that hourly earnings rose 0.2% the smallest increase since February 2022 and another indication that inflation may be cooling.

Federal Reserve officials will be looking for more sustainable job growth when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the November employment data on Friday. In addition to the number of jobs added market watchers will also be paying attention to hourly wage growth data and the overall unemployment rate which last month ticked up to 3.9%.

Meme Stock GameStop Looking to Improve Momentum

After posting narrower-than-expected losses during its quarter ending in July the original ""meme stock"" GameStop (GME) will look to keep momentum going when it reports earnings on Wednesday. In its previous report the retailer showed that it was increasingly relying on virtual sales and digital downloads as the industry shifts away from physical copies of video games. It will be the first earnings report since the video game retailer elevated activist investor Ryan Cohen to the position of CEO and president.

Shares of GameStop gained about 25% last week to trade higher than $15 a share in advance of the earnings report. In 2021 a frenzy of retail investors pushed the stock's share price to nearly $500 causing massive losses for hedge funds that had short sales on the stock.

Video games are one of the most consistently growing tech markets benefiting from never-ending demand for new content and hardware upgrades. The industry has multiple decades under its belt but has kept consumers coming back with innovative and engaging products. Data from Statista shows the video game market is projected to hit $250 billion this year and expand at a compound annual growth rate of 9% through 2028.

The sector has transformed in recent years to include new revenue-generating avenues such as microtransactions mobile games and subscription-based game services. As a result it's not a bad idea to dedicate a portion of your portfolio to the video game market and profit from its gradual growth for decades.

Here are three top gaming stocks to buy in December.

1. Nvidia

Nvidia (NVDA 0.22%) has become a favorite on Wall Street this year. Its growing prospects in artificial intelligence (AI) sent its shares soaring 220% since Jan. 1. However long before its prominence in AI Nvidia had a powerful position in gaming.

The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are popular among PC gamers who use Nvidia's hardware to build powerful gaming machines. Additionally the tech giant designs semi-custom chips for one of the world's most popular game consoles the Nintendo Switch. Nvidia's gaming segment posted revenue growth of 81% year over year in the third quarter of 2023 showing signs of recovery from last year's economic downturn.

Nvidia is powering multiple areas of gaming with its chips making its stock one of the best ways to invest in the industry. Meanwhile its dominance in AI only strengthens its gaming potential as it can offer video game companies access to immensely powerful hardware.

The company's price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 62 is pretty high right now and suggests its shares are expensive. However both Nvidia's P/E and price-to-free cash flow have declined by over 70% since July indicating its shares are much cheaper than just a few months ago. And as chip stocks go Nvidia's P/E is significantly lower than AMD's which has soared over 1000. Alongside a powerful position in gaming and AI it's worth buying Nvidia this month before its stock rises any higher.

2. Microsoft

Microsoft (MSFT 0.18%) wasn't always successful in video games launching its Xbox brand in 2001 with the release of its first console. The American company took a gamble by entering a highly competitive sector that Japanese companies like Nintendo and Sony had long dominated.

However Microsoft has come a long way in the last 20 years. It's now among the top four biggest public game companies by revenue as of the second quarter of 2023.

The tech giant hit a major milestone in its gaming journey in 2017 when it debuted Xbox Game Pass a subscription-based service that offers members access to an extensive library of games for a small monthly fee. Game Pass has often been described as Netflix for games. One of its biggest selling points is that subscribers can play brand-new Microsoft titles on day one of their releases at no extra charge.

From 2020 to 2022 Game Pass members rose 150% to 25 million. The platform added significant value to Microsoft's Xbox console removing the need for consumers to pay individually for games as was necessary on competing consoles. Moreover Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard this year will further boost Game Pass with its catalog of popular titles such as Call of Duty and Overwatch.

Microsoft's future is bright as we head into the new year making its shares a compelling option for anyone looking to invest in video games this December. The company's average 12-month price target is currently at $407 projecting stock growth of about 9%. Meanwhile 48 out of 53 analysts currently rate its stock as a buy/strong buy. With a recent acquisition and a budding AI business the tech giant is likely to at least match that growth and potentially soar far higher. As a result its stock is worth picking up this month.

3. Apple

Apple (AAPL 0.35%) might not be the first company you think of in a gaming discussion but it has a potent position in the sector with the success of its App Store. In 2022 66% of App Store spending came from mobile games earning $110 billion of the platform's $167 billion. Mobile games have been so lucrative for Apple that the tech giant is the world's third-largest video game company by revenue.

App Store earnings are housed under Apple's services segment which also includes income from subscription platforms like Apple TV+ iCloud Music and more. Services have quickly become the company's second-highest earnings segment after the iPhone and are on track to eventually take the top spot.

In fiscal 2022 services revenue growth hit 14% year over year double that of the iPhone. Then in 2023 services delivered 9% growth while Apple's smartphone business declined by 2%.

Mobile games are a highly profitable business for Apple. This is likely to expand as smartphones grow more powerful and allow for better gaming. Meanwhile new device options such as the company's soon-to-be-released Vision Pro virtual/augmented reality headset could unlock new earning opportunities in the industry.

Apple shares have risen 320% since 2018 illustrating the reliability of its stock. Additionally the chart above shows Apple has the lowest P/E and price-to-free cash flow of any stock on this list making it one of the cheapest high profile investment options in tech and gaming. The company offers a unique but lucrative way to invest in video games so consider its stock this December.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndpb25ld3MuY29tL3dvcmxkL3VzLWZvcmNlcy1zYXVkaS1iYWNrZWQtZnVuZC10by1leGl0LXNhbS1hbHRtYW5zLWFpLXN0YXJ0dXAtYW1pZC10ZWNoLXRyYW5zZmVyLWNvbmNlcm5zLTY2NTMwN9IBf2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndpb25ld3MuY29tL3dvcmxkL3VzLWZvcmNlcy1zYXVkaS1iYWNrZWQtZnVuZC10by1leGl0LXNhbS1hbHRtYW5zLWFpLXN0YXJ0dXAtYW1pZC10ZWNoLXRyYW5zZmVyLWNvbmNlcm5zLTY2NTMwNy9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,US forces Saudi-backed fund to exit Sam Altman’s AI startup amid tech-transfer concerns,"The United States reportedly forced a Saudi-backed fund to disinvest from a major Artificial Intelligence (AI) chip startup backed by OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman.

Rain Neuromorphics a startup designing chips had raised $25 million last year from a Saudi Aramco-backed venture capital firm Prosperity7.

The startup aims to design chips that mirror how the brain works and serve companies that employ AI-powered tools.

The move to compel Prosperity7 to exit the US AI firm came after an intervention by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.

Move taken on national security grounds

According to Bloomberg the Saudi fund was informed last year about the Committee’s decision a move which came in the backdrop of concerns regarding national security.

""CFIUS is committed to taking all necessary actions within its authority to safeguard U.S. national security. Consistent with law and practice CFIUS does not publicly comment on transactions that it may or may not be reviewing"" the US watchdog said in a statement.

CFIUS is an inter-agency committee which reviews foreign investments in US businesses and real estate that implicate national security concerns Reuters reported.

USA aims to regulate global AI

The move to cut off Rain AI’s links to Saudi Arabia highlights the USA’s intentions to regulate and shape the global spread and development of advanced technologies to maintain an edge over rivals like China.

Watch: OpenAI's CEO Shake-Up × Given this the US expanded restrictions on the export of advanced AI chips products of companies like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to include certain West Asian countries.

China accessing USA’s tech through West Asia

In October this year concerns were raised that China was accessing advanced US AI tech through nations like Saudi Arabia.

China’s collaboration with the Saudis has deepened over the past years in the field of AI. Western officials have expressed long-standing anxieties regarding the increasing technology transfer between their traditional allies in the Gulf and China.

The West’s message for the West Asian nations is simple: If you want unhindered access to the US chip technology you will have to limit AI cooperation with the communist country.

In 2014 Agilent Technologies announced that it would stop selling nuclear magnetic resonance systems. Agilent which had acquired its NMR rival Varian in 2010 continued to fulfill existing orders so the last of its systems wasn’t installed until 2016. The owners of NMR spectrometers manufactured by either firm now face an uncertain future.

Agilent says it has no plans to stop supporting the instruments but customers know that they’re living on borrowed time: when the company decides to leave the field completely they will face the choice of maintaining the systems themselves finding third-party companies to provide service or upgrading their systems with newer control consoles.

NMR systems are core tools for research chemists. In proton NMR spectroscopy samples are placed in a spinning probe in a strong magnetic field—typically between 400 and 900 MHz. The nuclei of hydrogen atoms in the sample align with the magnetic field. To detect the atoms the sample is subjected to electromagnetic pulses. The pulses perturb the alignment an action that causes emission of electromagnetic waves. These carry information about the chemical environment of each of the hydrogen atoms which makes it possible to distinguish one bonding arrangement from another and deduce the structure of the sample molecules.

To function properly the magnet typically must be cooled with liquid helium. Researchers use a console to control the pulses and detect the nuclear responses.

Every research-oriented chemistry department needs an NMR—at least one if not two. Sophia Hayes vice-dean of graduate education Washington University in St. Louis

So far Agilent’s NMR service is going strong. David Rice has been director of the NMR facility at the University of California Merced since 2016. He was previously an application scientist at Varian and Agilent. “The UC Merced NMR facility has had a service contract with Agilent for my Varian and Agilent instruments since I joined here” he says. “They’ve given me excellent advice and come through with parts for me when I needed them.”

The High-Resolution NMR Facility at Washington University in St. Louis (WUSTL) is home to one of the last NMR systems Agilent sold. In addition to that 600 MHz instrument the facility runs four other Varian legacy instruments according to Manmilan Singh director of the facility.

Singh still calls Agilent when he needs a part to repair a machine. “The newer instruments if something goes wrong with them they definitely have the parts for it” he says. “Some of the older ones they can find the part for you but it takes a while sometimes. Then you have to start exploring other avenues.”

One avenue is do-it-yourself maintenance. The High-Resolution NMR Facility has multiple defunct Varian systems that researchers mine for parts. Singh is “extremely good with hardware” says Sophia Hayes vice-dean of graduate education and an NMR researcher in WUSTL’s chemistry department. “His skills with NMR hardware are extraordinary. Most people have one console and when something breaks there’s no backup.”

Daniel Holmes who runs the NMR facility at Michigan State University takes a similar DIY approach. “Mostly I rely on myself and my years of experience with these systems. I’ve been doing this for 20-some years so I know what tends to break” he says.

At both WUSTL and Michigan State the NMR facilities stockpile old consoles after upgrades to scavenge them for parts. And they don’t keep just their own systems. Some universities give away old consoles when they upgrade because they don’t have the storage space. “We will snap them up so I have a lot of spare parts” Holmes says.

For people looking to keep their existing systems running user groups can provide advice. After Agilent announced that it was leaving the NMR market Rice helped organize IVAN—which originally stood for International Varian–Agilent NMR—as a place for Varian and Agilent users to ask and answer questions.

IVAN has since expanded into a general NMR discussion forum; the acronym now stands for Inspiring a Versatile and Agile NMR Community. The group sponsors user meetings immediately before the annual Experimental NMR Conference.

Properly maintained magnets can last for decades. But as control technology improves an older console can become a hindrance. Users with legacy NMR spectrometers have the option of installing either new or refurbished consoles.

“In a 15-year-old NMR spectrometer the magnet still has many many years of life to it” says Jon Webb the founder and CEO of MR Resources a company that sells late-model reconditioned spectrometers consoles and magnets. Webb is also one of the founders of IVAN. A customer with such a spectrometer “might choose the path of a reconditioned console” he says. “We would sell them a console new to them which would be 2 or 3 or 4 years old and would have a significantly lower price point than a brand-new console.”

Or people can opt for a brand-new console. JEOL Bruker and Q One Tech are the remaining suppliers of large NMR instruments. Earlier this year JEOL launched a re-consoling initiative for legacy NMRs. “Some of those NMR systems are pushing 20 years old so the electronics in the computers are getting dated and failure modes are increasing” says Michael Frey an emeritus NMR product manager at JEOL who was involved in developing the initiative.

“It’s very cost effective to just pull out the console leave the magnet and put a new console on it” Frey says. “The large investment is the magnet. The console is depending on the field anywhere from 50% down to 20% of the value of the system. So that’s a big cost savings.” Despite being less expensive than an entirely new system a new console is still in the six-figure range and can be out of reach for smaller institutions.

For re-consoling the system is stripped of everything but the magnet. That means removing the old console shim system and probes and installing new components. The shim system controls the homogeneity of the magnetic field and the probes hold samples and contain the electronics used for exciting nuclei and detecting NMR signals.

“It’s like a standard NMR system installation after that although you’re not going through the hassle of having to go through a complete magnet installation” Frey says. “It’s usually much quicker typically less than a week and you’re back up and going with a brand-new system with typically better performance than what you had before as well as greatly increased reliability.”

Not every magnet is a good candidate for re-consoling. “We ask the customers to fill out some documentation because we have to know what the magnet is. They are mechanically different” Frey says. “There are a few very strange magnets that only a couple of versions of were sold.” In addition if a magnet has been quenched or shut down the likelihood is slim of being able to make it work with a new console.

While researchers deal with the practical ramifications of Agilent’s exit WUSTL’s Hayes is considering the broader implications. “I think we might see changes because what this has shown is that it’s like a single-point-of-failure model. We are now in a situation where hardware with very high capital equipment costs is purchased only to learn that the company may choose not to be in this business within a year or two thereafter” she says.

NMR instruments are unique in their longevity Hayes notes. “In many cases we have been fortunate as a department to keep them for 20 or 30 years. So what do you do in terms of robust decision-making when the landscape for vendors of such equipment is so uncertain?”

Hayes predicts that in the next decade or two there could be a shift toward benchtop instruments for routine analysis in synthesis labs—both to avoid the large purchases and to circumvent difficulties with the helium market. But until then she adds “every research-oriented chemistry department needs an NMR—at least one if not two.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

The residents who oppose a plan to let heavy industry use Lake Maurepas as a storage site for carbon dioxide emissions span the spectrum of race class age education level and political affiliation.

Chemical giant Air Products wants to drill wells in Lake Maurepas to inject 5 million tons of carbon dioxide per year about a mile below the lakebed. It’s part of a $4.5 billion hydrogen manufacturing complex in adjacent Ascension Parish that would use carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology to pipe air pollution under the lake rather than release it into the atmosphere.

If successful the project would allow Air Products to produce “blue hydrogen” a cleaner alternative to natural gas and other fossil fuels that petrochemical manufacturers burn to make their products.

It’s also cleaner than the common production of hydrogen fuel called “gray hydrogen” which is derived from natural gas in a chemical process that emits large amounts of methane a potent greenhouse gas.

Blue hydrogen production relies on carbon capture technology to trap and store the carbon waste deep underground. “Green hydrogen” is considered the cleanest form and is produced through electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources such as solar or wind. All three fuels are chemically the same and differ only in how they are produced.

An increasing number of residents in Tangipahoa Livingston and St. John the Baptist parishes see the Air Products project as little more than profiteering and reckless industrialization of an iconic lake they say has only recently begun to recover after generations of ecological destruction.

Kim Coates who lives in Tangipahoa Parish has been strongly opposed to the project and made it one of the central issues in her recent campaign for the District 73 seat in the Louisiana House of Representatives which she won. In an interview Thursday she said Air Products’ Lake Maurepas project is just about the most universally hated idea in southeast Louisiana.

Taxpayers have invested millions into restoring Lake Maurepas’ ecosystem and some of those efforts have so far proven successful she said.

The greater Lake Pontchartrain Basin which includes Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas is one of the largest estuaries and home to one of the largest contiguous forests in the country. But its fragile ecosystem has suffered from human activities such as oil and gas exploration logging levees along the Mississippi River and the introduction of invasive species according to studies from the Nature Conservancy and the Southeast Louisiana University Wetlands Restoration Laboratory among others.

Some recovery efforts began in the 1990s including a drilling moratorium in Lake Pontchartrain and a prohibition on dredging in both lakes. More recently the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program is a federal initiative that received $10 million in annual funding from President Joe Biden’s 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law

“We’ve put millions and millions of dollars into restoration to protect that ecosystem and you’re gonna turn around and undo it?” Coates said.

Other area residents have voiced similar sentiments at public meetings throughout the year most recently Wednesday at the latest hearing of the Louisiana Senate’s Task Force on Local Impacts of Carbon Capture and Sequestration. The panel is charged with gathering information and making legislative recommendations to lawmakers.

Laurie Sagnibene a Baton Rouge resident with a house on the Tickfaw River which drains into Lake Maurepas was one of many who voiced opposition to the project.

“Air Products claims they want to be a good neighbor protect the lake” Sagnibene said. “If you want to protect the lake leave it alone.”

Several expressed concern over the risks and uncertainties surrounding CO2 pipelines and CCS technologies that remain largely untested at large scale. Those same concerns are shared among the scientific and environmental communities.

Such projects can be very costly and have resulted in dangerous accidents such as the Feb. 22 2020 explosion of a CO2 pipeline in Satartia Mississippi. The incident led to a mass poisoning that hospitalized at least 45 residents and forced more than 200 to evacuate the small rural community.

Several residents referred to the Satartia incident when they addressed the task force. They pointed out how the first responders also became victims when they tried to drive into the area and were stranded because the large carbon dioxide cloud deprived their emergency vehicles of oxygen critical to the operation of combustion engines. Some struggled to breath and passed out.

Springfield resident Mindy Starkey has a family camp about 500 yards from Lake Maurepas.

“What happens when there’s a malfunction an explosion?” she said. “What happens to me and my grandchildren when we’re down at our camp?”

Others are not strictly opposed to CCS and are more worried about property values and the general environmental impacts to the lake.

“We’re not against carbon capture statewide but we are against it in Lake Maurepas” said Bill Whittington founder of the Lake Maurepas Preservation Society.

Many of the residents pointed out that the only support for the project has come from lobbyists and people who have a vested financial interest in it. Ahead of this year’s regular legislative session Air Products hired 25 lobbyists to help secure its project and fend off any adverse legislation — a campaign that paid off. Every bill that tried to halt or slow down the Lake Maurepas project failed to gain traction.

The company also hired Gov. John Bel Edwards’ former spokesperson Christina Stephens. The outgoing governor has been a vocal proponent of carbon capture as a key vehicle to reach his goal to make Louisiana a carbon neutral state by 2050.

Gifford Briggs Gulf Coast region director for the American Petroleum Institute told the Illuminator any characterization of carbon capture as a “new technology” is a false narrative. It has been used for several years with only the storage component being a relatively recent development he said.

Despite increasing public opposition Air Products’ Lake Maurepas proposal has so far sailed smoothly through the state’s regulatory hurdles. The company has brought drilling rigs into the lake to drill test wells after conducting controversial seismic testing earlier this year.

Carbon capture has powerful backers such as the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry one of the most influential lobby groups in the state. Big oil and industrial companies see the technology as a possible lifeline during the energy transition.

A spokesperson for Gov.-elect Jeff Landry declined to offer any insights on Landry’s opinion of the project although he said last month that efforts to achieve carbon neutral status in Louisiana shouldn’t be at the expense of oil and gas industry progress.

State Rep. Valarie Hodges R-Denham Springs also attended Wednesday’s task force meeting. She said Air Products should try to relocate its project somewhere else in Louisiana where it will have a lesser impact on the environment and people. Hodges won election to the Louisiana Senate in October.

“We’re asking: Can these companies — Oxy and Air Products — consider a different location that does not have such a dramatic impact on our way of life?” Hodges said.

When several residents expressed despair over state regulators ignoring or dismissing their concerns Hodges reassured them the task force is listening and will have significant influence with the legislature.

The resolution that formed the task force touts the “massive” economic potential of CCS and notes that “Louisiana is blessed with a world-class volume of available pore space for storage … ideally positioning the state for development of the CCS sector into the future.” Sen. Heather Cloud R-Turkey Creek authored the resolution that claims CCS would help “improve the state’s environment.”

So far opposition from neighbors has not prompted Air Products to change its Lake Maurepas plans or consider moving to a new area.

Air Products plans to apply for another drilling permit in the coming months if its test well data indicates pore space below the lake is suitable for storing CO2 spokesperson Stephens said.

“We remain committed to the Lake Maurepas community and to ongoing outreach and education with the public residents and local officials” Stephens said.

She also touted the company’s recently launched Lake Maurepas Community Fund an annual commitment of $1 million to fund community projects while its CCS project is in operation. Air Products anticipates using the site for at least 25 years.

The company has also funded $9.9 million in research at Southeastern Louisiana University which has launched the Lake Maurepas Monitoring Project to monitor its health Stephens said.

Green hydrogen generates zero emissions. Hence many organizations are replacing fossil fuels such as coal or natural gas with green hydrogen. Green hydrogen power generation offers several benefits. For instance the extra energy generated through renewable sources such as wind turbines or solar PVs can be used for green hydrogen production. The produced hydrogen finds various applications across different sectors including transport industry or utility for grid injection. Moreover renewable power plants are generally located at distant locations from end-users. In such cases the generated power can be used for electrolysis for the production of green hydrogen thereby making transportation commoditized and unconstrained by grid connection similar to LNG. Such benefits are increasing the use of green energy as a clean fuel which is driving the growth of the market.

Market Segmentation:

The market is segmented by end-user (chemical power industrial and mobility and others) technology (alkaline electrolyzer and polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer) and geography (APAC Europe North America Middle East and Africa and South America).

The market growth in the chemical segment will be significant over the forecast period. The chemical industry is the largest end-user of green hydrogen. Green hydrogen is widely used in the manufacturing of chemical compounds such as paints synthetic fibers nylon and polyurethane elastomers and in the plasticization of plastics. The increasing demand for green feedstock or precursor molecules such as ammonia and methanol is another major factor driving the growth of the segment.

APAC will account for 57% of the market growth during the forecast period. The growth of the regional market is driven by rising investments in industries such as chemical fertilizer refinery glass semiconductor metal processing and food. In addition the increasing adoption of clean green hydrogen generation technologies across industries will drive the growth of the green hydrogen market in APAC.

Market Dynamics:

Key Drivers:

Growing adoption of clean fuel

Growing adoption of fuel cell-powered vehicles

Increasing focus on decarbonization

Major Trends:

Increasing initiatives by the governments

Growing focus on using clean hydrogen in refineries

Rising usage of fuel cells in the stationary power sector

Governments worldwide are undertaking various initiatives to reduce carbon emissions by encouraging the adoption of clean energy generation technologies. For instance the European Union (EU) has defined a hydrogen strategy as part of the Great Deal. In the first phase of the initiative between 2020 and 2024 the objective is to build at install at least 6 GW of electrolyzers in the EU and produce up to 1 million tons of green hydrogen. In the second phase between 2024 and 2023 the objective is to install 40 GW of electrolyzers to produce 10 million tons of green hydrogen. Such initiatives adopted by governments across the world will positively impact the growth of the market during the forecast period.

Key Challenges:

For years it has been illegal for homes in New York City to be rented out for fewer than 30 days. However the ordinance was hardly enforced. And many property owners earned money through the rise of short-term rentals.

But the city in September began enforcing a new ordinance that requires short-term rental hosts to register with the city. The ordinance which passed in January 2022 but had been held up in court also ices out market juggernauts Airbnb Vrbo and similar platforms from processing transactions for any unregistered short-term rentals.

Hosts can get city approval to offer short-term rentals only if they are on the premises during the visitors’ stay and if the number of guests is limited to two. That’s expected to severely limit the number of available rentals since few hosts are willing to meet those requirements.

In recent weeks thousands of New York City short-term rentals have vanished from Airbnb’s webpage and on Dec. 2 the company will cancel and refund all reservations for unregistered rentals made through the portal. The city and company had agreed to allow all previous reservations with check-ins by Dec. 1.

The aim of the crackdown is to return thousands of possible long-term rental units to the city’s housing market which is short on available and affordable options.

If New York City’s approach is successful policy experts think other cities might emulate the city’s restrictions. But the city faces an uphill battle in meeting the sizable demand for short-term stays; tourism promoters predict 63.3 million visitors this year and hotel occupancy hovers near 90%. And many observers doubt whether such limits would significantly reopen housing units to long-term tenants.

Officials from the Mayor’s Special Office of Enforcement the agency tasked with registering legal short-term rentals in New York City told Stateline that there are slightly more than 800 licensed short-term legal rentals entering December. In August there were nearly 22000 Airbnb short-term rentals alone.

More than 5170 applications had been submitted to the office as of Nov. 20 with about 500 denied and more than 1700 sent back to applicants for added information or to “correct deficiencies” in the application.

Jorge González a researcher with the Urban Institute a nonprofit think tank said the success of New York’s crackdown will depend on whether hotels can pick up the slack.

Rentals and housing

The nation’s housing crunch has many officials blaming short-term rentals for taking shelter off the market. A 2016 article in the Harvard Law & Policy Review suggested that short-term rentals “[reduce] the affordable housing supply” by removing long-term rentals from the housing market and keeping local residents from moving in.

Dozens of localities throughout the United States have regulated short-term rentals.

But none has gone as far as New York City.

“The law and rules effectively ban short-term rentals in New York City and are a stark contrast to cities around the world that have enacted fair and balanced short-term rental rules” wrote Theo Yedinsky Airbnb’s global policy director in a June letter on the company’s website.

Airbnb says it worked for years to find a compromise.

“These rules are an outlier and stand in contrast to the approach of other cities around the country going as far as to prohibit New Yorkers from sharing their homes when they are away for work or travel hosting more than two guests at the same time and requiring that they must certify they understand numerous lengthy and complicated city codes” the company wrote in a prepared statement in response to Stateline.

González said policies to regulate the short-term rental market in both domestic and international cities have varied from capping the length of a rental stay to restricting the number of guests to requiring the host to be on the premises.

“If New York City’s policy is successful it could embolden other cities to follow suit and use this as a way to not only rein in this industry but possibly address these long-term rental housing crises” said González. “I think there will be a lot learned in the next few weeks and months on whether this is an effective policy measure.”

One of the consequences of the city’s crackdown on Airbnb listings is already taking shape. More than 90% of the city’s current Airbnb rental stock of nearly 40000 units — of which 3746 are short-term rentals — is unlicensed according to Inside Airbnb a housing activist group that tracks the platform’s data.

If New York City’s policy is successful it could embolden other cities to follow suit and use this as a way to not only rein in this industry but possibly address these long-term rental housing crises. – Jorge González Urban Institute researcher

The fear of rising hotel prices and the dearth of legal rentals are prompting some tourists to turn to short-term rentals listed on Craigslist part of a burgeoning alternative market of unregistered unlicensed short-term rentals in the wake of the city’s restrictions.

For travelers such as Dustin Smith and his fiancée Carly Barnes it’s worth the risk when they visit New York City for the first time on Dec. 21 for a two-week stay.

“New York is already stretching our budget just to eat and sightsee so if we can get a good deal on the internet without paying an arm and a leg for a hotel we’ll take that chance” Smith who lives in Louisiana told Stateline.

Christian Klossner executive director of New York City’s Office of Special Enforcement told Stateline that his office will monitor the short-term rental industry as a whole including those spaces advertised on Craigslist and other sites. Hosts who violate the ordinance face a possible fine of $5000 and platforms could face penalties up to $1500.

City and state tensions

Bed-and-breakfasts a forerunner of today’s short-term rentals always have had a place in the hospitality sector. The market was intended for family-run operators researchers and industry experts told Stateline.

But the rise of home-sharing platforms has led to a “hotelization” of residential neighborhoods and with that concerns and calls from residents for more regulation.

A 2019 Economic Policy Institute study concluded that the economic harm Airbnb caused to long-term renters by reducing the housing supply and raising prices outweighed the benefits to travelers and property owners.

State lawmakers elsewhere continue to wrestle with the issue. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis a Democrat has endorsed efforts to tax short-term rentals the same as hotels. A bill is up for consideration in 2024. A measure in Arkansas to prohibit cities from enacting regulations on short-term rentals failed; a bill in Hawaii that would have allowed any county to phase out legal short-term rentals died in committee.

In past years though some state legislatures have protected Airbnb and property owners by forbidding certain city or county regulations. Arizona Florida Idaho Indiana Nebraska and Tennessee prohibit local governments from banning short-term rentals altogether.

The impact of Arizona’s 2016 law according to Tom Savage legislative director for the League of Arizona Cities and Towns is an influx of short-term rentals in the state’s tourism communities. Some are run by investment companies rather than mom-and-pops.

“This issue strains available housing stock and forces residents to nearby communities to find affordable housing” Savage said.

In three California cities with a large share of short-term rentals — Los Angeles San Francisco and San Diego — home-sharing ordinances have prohibited any listing of a short-term rental without a valid home-sharing registration number and have reduced the duration of an allowable “short-term” stay. Unlike NYC’s ordinance the California home-sharing ordinances don’t impose guest restrictions or require hosts to be onsite during stays.

Nationally there’s a shortage of 7.3 million rental homes deemed affordable and available to renters with extremely low incomes according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

“In the context of the housing crisis especially in these big cities like New York San Francisco or Austin [Texas] there’s a demand to regulate these short-term rental platforms and possibly find a way to make these units available” said González of the Urban Institute.

“So there will be cities looking at how New York City’s ban is successful in not only controlling this market but reaching those goals in terms of affordability and availability.”

Legal challenges

If cities are to follow New York City’s crackdown they’ll need to clear their first hurdle: legal challenges. When Local Law 18 passed in January 2022 Airbnb sued to block the ordinance. Its lawsuit was dismissed in August with a court arguing that Airbnb’s disagreement with city policy wasn’t a reason to block the law. That paved the way for registration and enforcement to take effect in September.

In her ruling New York state Supreme Court Justice Arlene P. Bluth argued that the city’s regulations give Airbnb “a very simple way” to ensure it’s not profiting off of unlawful activity.

Data from Airbnb watchdog group Inside Airbnb shows that there were 21785 short-term rentals in New York City as of August. That number dwindled to 6841 by the start of September as unregistered and illegal rentals began to vanish.

Dallas and New Orleans have tried to use zoning restrictions to curb short-term rentals such as by prohibiting them in residential areas but the policies have been challenged in court delaying their effect.

In some cases courts have agreed with property owners and pro-short-term rental groups.

A federal judge this summer ruled a 2016 Austin ordinance that would have prohibited people from operating rentals if they don’t live on the property to be unconstitutional. Earlier this year a Clark County Nevada district judge declared a county ordinance that in part mandated owner occupancy and distance among short-term rental properties to be unconstitutionally vague.

‘Short-term rentals are here to stay’

Policy experts say short-term rentals are here to stay as travelers’ habits have shifted toward those accommodations.

A report by AirDNA group a company that provides analytics for the short-term rental industry shows that short-term rental supply and demand is outpacing hotels a trend that could continue in 2024 in spite of regulations.

I feel like the city is scapegoating us as a reason for their poor handling of this housing crisis. People can’t afford to live here because of the city and their inability to rein in the real estate bozos. Not because of my short-term rental. – Joseph Bruno New York City Airbnb host

Advocates for short-term rentals say that even the most restrictive bans won’t guarantee that former Airbnb or Vrbo hosts will offer the spaces for long-term leasing.

In Dallas Dave Krauss has been hosting a bed-and-breakfast lodging since 2013 and thinks that compliant hosts and short-term rentals add value to the city.

Krauss and his organization Rent Responsibly work to keep short-term rentals in compliance with local regulations. For Krauss ordinances that incentivize and provide legal pathways for short-term rentals are a good policy. But the line between management and banishment of short-term rentals will create unintended consequences for the market and the city he said.

“Regulations need to be living documents that are thoughtful iterative revisited and ultimately adapted to how this market progresses and the new technologies and new” said Krauss. “A ban creates a tricky situation that causes activity to go underground. Short-term rentals are here to stay and I think cities can do more to work with good actors rather than impose bans that hurt everyone.”

In New York City Long Island native Joseph Bruno has hosted more than 200 people in his Upper West Side apartment since August 2020 after he listed it on Airbnb as a way to bring in more income. Despite the city’s ban he said he’s not going to stop finding ways to promote his apartment as a short-term rental. He won’t turn it over for a long-term tenant.

“I feel like the city is scapegoating us as a reason for their poor handling of this housing crisis” said Bruno. “People can’t afford to live here because of the city and their inability to rein in the real estate bozos. Not because of my short-term rental.”

The Los Angeles City Council has given the green light to a new law mandating hosts of short-term rentals including Airbnb and hotels to acquire a police permit aiming to tackle issues like party houses and crime in such properties as the Los Angeles Times reported.

Proponents led by Council President Paul Krekorian argue that the permit requirement will enable the city to better regulate short-term rentals creating additional bureaucracy for operators. The law provides a mechanism for the City Council and communities to contest the issuance of permits.

Various businesses in Los Angeles such as car valets antique stores and bowling alleys already need a police permit to operate involving criminal background checks and substantial fees. As Krekorian stated the goal is to make the process “as easy and painless and nearly automatic as I can.” He emphasized that routine approval would be granted unless a specific complaint was raised.

According to the Planning Department 6725 short-term rental units are listed with the city. The operator of the short-term rental unit would be required to obtain a police permit under this new ordinance.

During a council committee hearing some Airbnb hosts were unhappy about the proposal labeling the police permit requirement as excessive. They objected to being fingerprinted as part of a criminal background check and raised questions about the permit fees. Officially fees haven’t been set but the suggestion is that it would be around $260. Krekorian expressed the hope that the background check could be conducted without fingerprinting.

Airbnb declined to comment on the proposal while Peter Hillan a spokesperson for the Hotel Association of Los Angeles expressed concern about the new requirement. He questioned whether the LAPD had adequate staff to oversee the additional permits.

The police permit mandate is part of a broader set of regulations unveiled earlier this month focusing on new hotels. The regulations negotiated between the city and hotel workers union impose a more rigorous approval process for new hotels and require developers to replace demolished homes with new residential units or renovate existing ones.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyYm5iLWhvc3QtY2hyaXN0bWFzLXJlbnRhbC13aW50ZXItc2hvcnQtdGVybS12YWNhdGlvbi1ob3VzZS0yMDIzLTEx0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9haXJibmItaG9zdC1jaHJpc3RtYXMtcmVudGFsLXdpbnRlci1zaG9ydC10ZXJtLXZhY2F0aW9uLWhvdXNlLTIwMjMtMTE_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Airbnb hosts: 'Tis the season to raise prices on Christmas rentals,"Melinda Johnson who runs 29 Airbnbs in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee decks their halls for the competitive holiday season. Courtesy of Melinda Johnson

Nightly rates for Airbnbs spike during the holidays. One Tennessee cabin triples its price.

Hosts go all out to woo guests corralling dozens of Christmas trees and backup turkeys.

One analyst said Airbnb owners who don't raise their rates enough are ""leaving money on the table.""

This year Melinda Johnson is decorating 29 Christmas trees.

Johnson who manages 29 Airbnbs across the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee is going the extra mile to set her properties apart ahead a crucial winter-holiday season.

Even as the economy slows and inflation cramps spending people still reach for their wallets to book December getaways. Short-term rental owners who in some areas have been struggling to make the profits that they'd dreamed of are ready to take advantage.

Airbnb hosts and property managers see the holiday season as an opportunity to nab big bookings during the slower winter months when people tend to travel less. The last few weeks of December can make up for the seasonal slog.

""It's something we count on for the winter months"" Johnson told Business Insider.

Hosts like Johnson will charge as much as they need to — so it's no shock your Christmastime Airbnb costs a pretty penny.

Take one of her most popular properties a three-bedroom cabin with king-size beds en-suite bathrooms and a game room. A typical night in October runs $179. Over Thanksgiving she brought in $450 per night. For Christmas the cabin is booked at $650 per night.

In addition to decking the halls with trees stockings and more Johnson and her team hire extra cleaners at $30 an hour to scour the rentals before the holiday check-ins scrubbing tile grout and removing the windows from their frames to thoroughly dust.

'Tis the season for Airbnb hosts to raise prices

The short-term-rental market is complicated.

Hosts are still seeing record-high demand for bookings but average revenue per available room declined 0.5% in October after three years of growth according to short-term-rental analytics firm AirDNA.

AirDNA economist Jamie Lane said profitability is ""harder than ever in short-term rentals"" especially for new investors who may have purchased properties at higher prices with steeper mortgage interest rates.

The solution? Charge more at key times.







Some hosts Lane explained nudge their nighty rates up and down based on demand while others set a flat rate for the whole year. AirDNA tracks the difference between the strategies and says there's a clear winner in playing into demand.

""You can get 20% more revenue by actively managing your revenue your rates as opposed to just 'set it and forget it'"" Lane told BI.

AirDNA data shows the last week of the year is typically the second highest-income week for short-term rentals surpassed only by the Fourth of July. It takes on special importance for hosts since it's surrounded by slump periods in late fall and early winter.

Hosts deck the halls to nab the highest prices possible

Los Angeles property manager Austin Weinerman whose company manages 100 Airbnbs across nine states puts enough turkeys on hold that every home could be delivered a backup bird if something went wrong.

""We're fully stocked across each market so there shouldn't be a scenario where someone goes without a turkey"" he told Business Insider.

Weinerman also stressed the importance of raising rates to the maximum the market will allow.

A five-bedroom home in South Florida he manages comes complete with a fire pit a pool a jungle gym and an under-the-sea-themed kids playroom. A typical night there will fall between $400 and $700. But for Thanksgiving it was listed for $1500 to $1700 per night; around Christmas it will go for $2000 to $2300 a night.

""The holidays are some of our biggest-dollar-amount bookings so it's so important that everything goes smoothly"" he said.

Host Ryan Villines however told BI that he maintains his base rate of $299 per night for his one-bedroom getaway in the lakeside town of Warsaw Missouri. He only adds a $25-per-person charge for the holidays to account for large groups traveling together.

He doesn't like to raise prices too high.

""Maybe if I was in Acapulco or somewhere tropical"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vOTJtb29zZS5mbS9oYXJyeS1wb3R0ZXItdGhlbWVkLWFpcmJuYi1pbi1tYXNzYWNodXNldHRzLWlzLWFuLWFzcGlyaW5nLXdpemFyZHMtZHJlYW0v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Harry Potter-Themed Airbnb in Massachusetts is an Aspiring Wizard's Dream,"In the interest of being transparent I would like to come out as someone who is not super into the Harry Potter franchise.

Rob Csernyik is a 2022 Michener-Deacon fellow and a contributing columnist for The Globe and Mail.

In the past work-shy wannabe business moguls gravitated toward relaxed and relatively unremarkable paths to entrepreneurship such as automatic car washes self-serve laundromats and vending machine ownership. To the chagrin of travellers and in defiance of the meaning of hospitality this set has claimed Airbnb ABNB-Q hosting as today’s hot ticket to passive income.

Over the past few years a glib approach to the hotelier business – often grimly appointed properties purchased as income streams sometimes stuffed to the gills with guests – has become a defining feature of the platform.

Its original mission was to allow canny property owners access to the gig economy turning underused guest rooms into income generators. The budget-minded travellers who booked them saved on higher hotel costs and enjoyed amenities such as kitchens and free laundry machines. Over the years as hosts’ ambitions have grown beyond the confines of their primary residence the landscape has shifted.

Airbnb prices now rival decent-quality hotels (in part because of now-infamous cleaning fees) pedantic and sometimes bizarre rules kill vacation vibes and with owners frequently living offsite attention to detail has slackened. And don’t get me started on how the professional Airbnb landlord class has contributed to rising rents by removing long-term housing stock from the market.

Gold: B.C.’s Airbnb crackdown will devastate some real estate investors

Some hosts are quick to bemoan the financial challenges they now face keeping their short-term rental properties afloat. While the federal government has recently announced plans to fund municipal enforcement against short-term rentals that counter local regulations or bans and to deny their owners tax deductions previously available for expenses sympathy is in short supply.

Next May British Columbia will ban most rentals that are not the owner’s primary residence. But all entrepreneurs have to accept that they take risks. The true losers in the equation have been guests subjected to previously unimaginable takes on hospitality and the renters among us facing an ever-escalating crisis.

Though Airbnb is trying to refocus on owner-occupied properties through its “Rooms” initiative prioritizing affordability and hospitality this doesn’t go far enough. If the platform is going to be useful it needs to attack the primary source of rot – the new entrepreneurial archetype it ushered into our consciousness.

This segment of hosts are a mix of everything loathsome about indifferent landlords and everything detestable about lazy entrepreneurs. With more than four million Airbnb hosts globally as of December 2022 even a single-digit percentage of such rotten apples is a dizzying amount of people. Tempering this madness requires a dose of reality. Hosts need to step up to the plate as the innkeepers they signed up to be.

Consider my recent stay in an Airbnb that was less a guesthouse than a self-storage unit for tourists. Though pictures suggested a cozy cottage only after I entered did I realize the owner had carved the erstwhile family home into about 10 bedrooms for short-term rent. This fact wasn’t vouchsafed in the ad. There was one bathroom to share along with a washer but no dryer. Four dining chairs and a table were the only common furniture.

My host according to his profile was a father of four who loved accommodating guests. In reality he fronted a company with multiple similarly spartan Airbnb properties and was slower than most hosts at responding to messages. When a couple showed up to find their room double-booked their anxiety rose as they couldn’t get a hold of him.

In the five years I’ve rented from the platform the cottage stay was the first time I faced such a lousy experience. But I know I have been lucky. Airbnb has spent millions of dollars covering up users’ disastrous stays. The platform’s chief executive Brian Chesky has acknowledged “tens of thousands” of social media complaints about rapidly escalating prices. Black users have reported discrimination. Back in 2018 a video-surveillance problem got so serious that Airbnb had to come up with rules specifically addressing it.

Then there’re the issues faced not by users but neighbours of those perpetual Airbnb rental pads. Municipal complaints against short-term rentals in Toronto have skyrocketed on an exponential curve. And did I mention the housing crisis?

Take your pick. There’s a wide spectrum of problems plaguing Airbnb and its rising group of professional short-term landlords. My recent experience was but a fleck of paint in a bigger backdrop.

Not only because there was a degree of bait-and-switch but my experience and needs as a guest were afterthoughts. The lack of hospitality and cost-cutting measures – the absence of a second bathroom a dryer furniture on the veranda – were as plain as day. In the past several months I’ve stayed in two others where the yards turned out to be strewn with old appliances and other flotsam and jetsam suggesting a correlation in hosts’ minds between where the guests and the junk sleep.

Such entrepreneurs need a primer on the “bnb” part of Airbnb. Long before the company’s launch 15 years ago bed-and-breakfasts had reputations as luxurious treats for romantic weekends or special occasions. The term conjures images of immaculately kept historic homes with special touches from pillow mints and turndown service to fluffy robes and sumptuous meals. It was (and continues to be) a lodging category built on a strong service focus and one which guests understandably pay a premium for.

Yet the prices at some Airbnbs can rival these experiences while providing far fewer benefits. That one has a deep devotion to the quality of the stay and another doesn’t is strange. Creating enjoyable guest experiences pays dividends in this industry – whether through returning guests or referrals from positive reviews and word-of-mouth boosting occupancy.

Along with the disconnection from the realities of being a hotelier there’s a cognitive dissonance at play for a wide swath of hosts. Taking a disinterested approach to hosting guests requires forgetting what it’s like to be one. If my host at the cottage and I switched roles I suspect he wouldn’t find the number of people and level of amenities at the property acceptable. If one of the others discovered a yard full of castoffs at a place they had booked they would no doubt find it dispiriting. Yet such hosts feel comfortable renting out their places because they fail to draw this connection.

Some of Airbnb’s ills such as its impact on housing markets won’t get solved overnight. But service quality can be fixed with greater haste. It improves the experiences of guests but also the businesses of the hosts so it should be a no-brainer. But it requires the host putting in more work and committing to treat their trade with the pro-active approach necessary to cater to hotel customers instead of the reactive approach landlords take with tenants. If that’s too much work my advice is to divest their properties and buy some vending machines or a laundromat. It will be a lot less headache for all involved."

The series was available on illicit websites and other digital mediums on the internet even before the original content was made available.

The online TV and movie revenue lost to piracy in India is expected to reach USD 3.08 billion by 2022. This is a development we’ve seen not just India; revenue losses and lost monetisation opportunities by virtue of content theft and piracy continue to plague the global media & entertainment industry today. The cost of global online streaming piracy will hit $52 billion by the year 2022 according to a report by Digital TV Research. Nearly 190-billion visits were made to illegal piracy websites in 2018 of which 17.4 Billion were from the US followed by the Russian Federation (14.5 Billion) Brazil (10.3 Billion); with India (9.6 Billion) and the United Kingdom (5.75 Billion) as the other top nations affected by online piracy. In terms of the type of content pirated almost 50 percent of the visits to pirated websites were for television shows and 20 percent of visitors were looking for the latest movies.

The widespread availability of online video content instigated by factors like ubiquitous high-speed data connectivity hyper-connected devices and living room experiences - are all playing their part in the explosion of video content consumption online making it lucrative for pirates to steal a portion of the pie. As more and more viewers are moving to mediums and platforms that are digitally native circumvention of subscriptions and geo-based restrictions to access premium content with no loss in experience or quality motivates end-users to embrace pirated means of consuming content.

There are multiple ways in which digital content piracy exists today. There might be genuine users who are paying for the content but start sharing their credentials with other users. Pirate sites might sign up with content providers in a single-user model but then start re-distributing content. There are sophisticated piracy tools like re-encoders or stream ripping tools being used to grab content and redistribute it. Another popular content piracy technique is circumventing geo-restriction by using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and proxy servers to mask unauthorized IP addresses to make it look like an authorized IP which might lead to media companies breaching contractual obligations with their rights' holders due to content viewership from unauthorised regions.

According to a survey of almost 200 media technology influencers and decision-makers conducted by Akamai in 2018 attacks on media organisations are widespread and of different types. Service downtime caused by DNS based attacks or DDoS attacks were listed as an important area of concern the second most important was protecting premium video content.

For media & entertainment organisations monetising premium video content and protecting it against unauthorised usage and distribution is key to a successful video strategy. Based on the survey organisations face a few challenges in implementing technologies to prevent content piracy.

The Akamai content protection portfolio is designed in a way to help media organisations defend themselves against critical threat vectors so that organisations can focus on their core which is creating and managing content; while offloading content distribution and the threats related to safeguarding it. The portfolio aims at helping organisations prevent content piracy unauthorised access and maximise monetisation opportunities. The portfolio provides a few key capabilities including user authentication access revocation geo-restrictions encryption watermarking and securing last mile delivery using Standard TLS.

Security in the media & entertainment industry means securing the entire content delivery path from the content provider to the viewer – adopting a holistic approach to security. Any media company that wants to serve or distribute its content to these end-users or viewers needs to protect itself from attacks that can originate at multiple points across the content delivery path. Content consumption has changed over the last few years and in that it has shaped the next wave of technology and how we interact with it. If viewers believe that Content is King companies should invest well to protect it.

Oh Wait …,"Sign up for daily news updates from CleanTechnica on email. Or follow us on Google News

There are products that transcend markets that pull new people into long established markets. Clearly the products have to be different unique but they also have to pull on the heart strings of many people for some reason. As soon as I saw the picture below I felt myself entering the market for a little boat. It looks so cool. It’s got coverage from the sun — but not in the old typical way of a normal boat. It’s small and seems like it could be affordable — no need for more in order to chill on the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. (In reality anything offshore is going to be out of my budget when dreams come ashore onto reality but anyhow….) It somehow reminds me of old James Bond movies and the great fun vehicles and clever tech you could find in them.

But then as I was reading about the boat I realized it wasn’t electric. … A non-electric boat is a definite no-go. I was so disappointed. It’s made of lightweight carbon fiber materials to improve efficiency. It’s got fully electric docking. But it burns fossil fuels. So disappointing.

Then I was looking for more info on the vehicle over on the website of the designer Pierpaolo Lazzarini and I discovered that there is an electric one! That would be the Jet Capsule ZERO:

Truthfully this is something quickly and smoothly slipping its way onto my “hopefully I could get this one day” list.

However … it seems this is not actually for sale. On the Jet Capsule website I don’t see anything about it. In fact there’s not really pricing or details about buying any Jet Capsule. What you do have is this note on the contact page: “Whether you’re ready to start working with us or want to learn more about Jet Capsule please use the contact form below to get in touch. We’d be happy to deal with you in order meet your goals.”

So yeah that’s all the info we have for now. I will reach out for more info but the cost is surely not super cheap if it’s got to be custom built. With extremely low volume (if existent at all) nothing is cheap. But man that sure is a cool little electric boat.

Or follow us on Google News

XPeng has had its ups and downs in the past couple of years but I continue to think that it’s got some of the best electric cars in the world and some of the best tech in the world. Value for the money XPeng can compete with anyone in the classes it sells in.

XPeng delivered 20041 “smart” electric vehicles in November. That’s an increase of 245% over its November 2022 total. It’s also the second month that XPeng went beyond 20000 sales. Extrapolating that kind of monthly output puts XPeng on track for nearly a quarter-million sales a year.

Though XPeng’s year-to-date total was just 121486 at the end of November because the company has grown month after month after month all year long. Every month for the past 10 months has seen higher sales than the month before.

XPeng’s G6 was a big part of the company’s success in November. “XPENG G6’s November deliveries reached 8750 units remaining the top-selling electric SUV model in the RMB200000-250000 price range.”

It’s now got another new model on the market just unveiled in the middle of November that aims to reap the rewards of all of XPeng’s tech innovation the X9. Read more about it here or see what Jo Borras and I have to say about it here:

Or really just look at the pictures:

XPeng also recently provided over-the-air updates for its vehicle owners. “On November 28 2023 XPENG brought G9 G6 and P7i owners an even more advanced driving experience with the latest OTA updates delivered through its smart cockpit operating system Xmart OS 4.4.0. As China’s first automaker to bring drivers mass-produced high-level ADAS for urban areas XPENG has once again pioneered the domestic EV industry with the latest OTA update of its next-gen XNGP ADAS that operates independently of HD map coverage in urban areas — a feature now available in more than 20 cities across China. This marks a giant leap forward for XNGP ADAS technology placing XPENG ahead of the industry curve.” XPeng may well be the world leader in terms of ADAS functionality and performance. But of course it is just focused on the Chinese market for now.

Clearly XPeng is on the upswing again. What will December bring? How long will the company’s growth streak run? How many people will jump in and buy the X9 high-tech futuristic luxury minivan? Will XPeng ever bring that wicked 7-seater to the US or Europe where it seems it would raise the bar in this category and potentially expand the market considerably? We’ll see.

SHENZHEN China Dec. 3 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Mileseey the highly sought-after brand of electronic measurement tools announced the launch of the groundbreaking D9 Pro laser measure that features industry-first visual aligning indicator. The bilateral aligning laser indicator is more than an analogy of the green laser line featured on Mileseey DTX10 and T1 Tomahawk that shows fast and accurate alignment to measuring points but offers a powerful and unprecedented measuring solution to hard-to-reach areas.

Mileseey

The groundbreaking tool designed to bring every touch of your spatial design vision into reality is now available on Kickstarter:

https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mileseeyd9/mileseey-d9-your-ultimate-space-transformation-companion?ref=a6rnxv

The D9 Pro stands apart as the world's first premium-grade laser measure that integrates bilateral visual aligning indicator. At the core of the visual aligning indicator are the Dual-Luminance Quantum Diodes (DLQD) and EchelonGaze Collimation Prism (EGCP) specifically engineered for the D9 Pro which project dual horizontal reference laser lines that are razor sharp (less than 1mm) and ultra visible with a line extension of over 33ft.

""The game-changing visual aligning indicator not only offers a fast and accurate visual guide for alignment of reference points in tricky areas and effectively aids in line marking but unprecedentedly allows professionals and DIY enthusiasts to indirectly measure distances in hard-to-reach areas without physically climbing the ladders"" says Mileseey's chief designer Tommy Young.

""While we have rocked the accuracy game of laser measurement and have taken the capability of our laser measurement tools to an unprecedented level our user-centric product innovation never stops"" Tommy added. ""Professionals and DIY enthusiasts oftentimes struggle to align their laser measures especially on irregular surfaces and in capturing reference points in inaccessible areas. This gives us impetus to fine-tune the precision and elevate the capability of laser measurement tools further through product innovation.""

Like using a tape measure humans are prone to errors when manually aligning the measuring device with measuring points and a small alignment error can lead to significant discrepancies of measurement results. The visual aligning indicator makes alignment and marking a breeze taking measuring efficiency accuracy and ease to another level and making it a perfect tool in home decoration or renovation projects where precise aligning and marking tasks are needed in numerous critical tasks.

The D9 Pro is also built for easy indoor measurement of inaccessible areas with comprehensive measuring solutions and features. The aligning laser extends up to 30ft easily capturing the hard-to-reach edges of beams frames and ceilings making indirect measurement possible by integrating the laser measurement with the extended aligning laser.

Measuring for inaccessible areas is complemented with the distinguished point-to-point (P2P) measuring technology driven by the built-in Intellipivot™ allowing users to measure the length between any two points from one remote location. The cutting-edge Intellipivot™ makes D9 Pro the exclusive model that rivals the S910 the most advanced model of Leica Geosystems that enables accurate P2P measurement without a tripod while avoiding extortionate pricing.

""The D9 Pro embodies our consistent commitments in product innovation"" Tommy emphasized ""This is seen by the unique feature of the live angle display alongside the visual aligning indicator."" The feature shows a live angle display in your angle measurement on any surface—vertical titled or horizontal giving you real-time dynamic feedback of the angle in your angle measurement. Say goodbye to the days of reading the mundane and static numbers of angle value. The modern approach brings a more intuitive and engaging measuring experience.

Range and accuracy are paramount for a laser measure and D9 Pro is no exception. Capitalizing on the newly developed patented PowerBurst & PowerChirp (PB & PC) technology driven by leading-edge sensor chip the D9 Pro offers a measuring range boosted to 330ft and an extreme accuracy of up to +/- 1/16"" thanks to the PB & PC technology. A comprehensive 18 fundamental and advanced measuring modes—more than any other models in the markets cater to all the critical calculations in complex and demanding interior design and home improvement projects.

The D9 Pro also sets itself apart as a design marvel with a meticulously engineered smooth and uniform magnesium-aluminum alloy finish showcasing timeless aesthetics perfect for those who prioritize the appeal of measurement tools to express a more professional image.

The unprecedented product innovation is further complemented by various user-friendly design features— a 2.4"" touch screen for more intuitive operation a flashlight for optimal visibility in dim environments and a built-in magnetic strip for quick grip and access.

""The D9 Pro is engineered not simply for redefining your space but redefining your life"" says Jore the CEO of Mileseey Technology.

The D9 Pro can be pre-ordered now on Kickstarter with special pricing for early supporters. Learn more here：

UNLEASH is a global platform for innovation committed to bringing the world’s top talents together to share ideas build networks and create solutions to help reach the SGDs.

Each year UNLEASH brings together 1000 young people (talents) from across the world in a new destination organizes local hackathons and supports ongoing capacity building and solutions implementation.

The Unleash Rwanda chapter was launched this December 2 2023 as the first in Africa and the sixth of its kind globally following similar events initiated in Denmark Singapore China Greenland and India since the inception of the Unleash concept in 2017.

Currently SGDs have been achieved only by 16% globally yet the timeline to attaining the goals is already half way to 2030.

Dr. Ngirente said that this is a good opportunity and a milestone in the journey that brings together young change makers to collaborate and innovate to solve current and emerging pressing challenges and challenge them to take lead.

The challenges he said were in the more than 1 billion people living in urban slums climate change poverty inequalities in different societies youth unemployment and most recently the impact of COVID-19.

“To address these challenges there is a need for a shift from our way of doing things if we are to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) within the set deadlines. This is where all of you – the young talents here today come in” Ngirente said.

How to do it?

Ngirente said that over 16% of the global population today are young people aged 15-24 years and this represents the most innovative and creative global demographic.

“Therefore you understand the exceptional asset that you are to the world” he said.

For this to happen for youth to play their critical role in attaining sustainable growth Ngirente said they must be equipped with the necessary skills to reach their full potential to drive global transformation but also collaboration is essential.

The PM stated that the Government of Rwanda acknowledges innovation as one of its key drivers of growth for not only solving our socio-economic challenges but also for creating jobs and the country has been blessed to recently host two similar events (the Kigali Economic Forum and the Innovation Africa 2023 Summit) which focused on youth.

Ngirente said the meetings reflected Rwanda’s collective commitment for youth entrepreneurship and promote innovative problem solving approaches amongst the youth from across the globe and while government partnership with different players have established multiple accelerator and innovation hubs for youth entrepreneurs and innovators the ball remains in the hands of the youth.

“The future rests in your hands take charge of your destiny and use today to dream and shape the future you want. You are a powerful force for change and development so take on that mantle with honor and zeal you have all our trust and support” he said.

Why Rwanda?

Since 2017 UNLEASH has grown into one of the world’s leading platforms for youth-led innovations and has engaged 7000 talents facilitated the development of 800 SDG solutions incubated more than 200 teams and been recognized as one of the world’s leading sustainability brands.

Minister of Youth and ICT (MYICT) Paula Ingabire said that with Rwanda increasingly becoming Africa’s foremost hub for entrepreneurship and events there is a unique opportunity to bring UNLEASH to Rwanda to unearth sustainable solutions and position Rwanda as the go to hub for start-ups in Africa.

Prof. Flemming Besenbacher Chairperson of UNLEASH said the event will benefit Rwanda bring it into the community of UNLEASH partners.

“UNLEASH is well-suited to boost Rwanda’s existing ecosystem for sustainability-minded entrepreneurs and Rwanda constitutes an ideal proof of-concept market in which early-stage innovations with scaling potential can be tested” Besenbacher said.

This year the event gathered youth from 166 countries and out of the 1000 youth talents that will compete 200 of them (20%) are selected from Rwanda with 100 of them being already in business.

Only five talents will be selected as the winners of the 2023 Kigali edition.

However UNLEASH and MYICT said the 2023 talents will be helped to find innovation space in Rwanda and also get the support they need to materialize their ideas into local and global solutions.",,,,,,,,,

Or follow us on Google News

Carbon dioxide reaches a liquid state when compressed and it expands with a pop when released and now the Italian startup Energy Dome is ready to harness the action for a new energy storage system that could provide far more storage at far less cost than conventional lithium-ion battery arrays. Energy Dome’s first project is getting under way in Italy with completion expected before the end of next year. A second project is already in the pipeline for the US state of Wisconsin too.

CO2 For Long Duration Energy Storage

With the climate crisis looming overhead long duration energy storage systems have been described as the key to unlocking vast reserves of intermittent wind and solar energy at a more rapid pace.

Lithium-ion battery arrays are currently the go-to medium for storing excess wind and solar energy. However the state of battery technology typically allows for about 4-6 hours of storage with newer systems topping out at eight hours. That’s enough to accomplish daily grid management tasks but the work will pile up as higher volumes of renewable energy flow into grid systems. For future grid resiliency energy planners are seeking a minimum of 10 hours in storage capacity ideally reaching a full day or much longer.

The idea of using liquid CO2 for energy storage is simple enough now that low cost renewable energy is at hand. During periods when renewable energy output is high but electricity demand is low grid managers have to order curtailments in wind or solar capacity. With a CO2 storage system the excess kilowatts can be put to work running compressors that convert a large volume of CO2 gas to a smaller volume of liquid. When released from compression and heated the CO2 expands back to a gas and is put to work running turbines to generate electricity.

Energy Dome crossed the CleanTechnica radar last year with a new “CO2 Battery” storage system. The company earned a place in BNEF Pioneers program of the influential Bloomberg NEF energy research organization based on its potential for achieving long duration energy storage of up to 24 hours. The system is relatively simple deploying expandable bladders as a storage platform.

“To ice the long duration energy storage cake Energy Dome claims that its system is based on proven technologies with non-flammable non-toxic materials and that it maintains its performance level for 25 years and possibly longer” we noted.

A New CO2 Storage System For Italy

In the latest development on Friday Energy Dome announced that it has gained project-level funding to begin work on its first “thermo-mechanical energy storage system” in the municipality of Otttana in the Sardinian province of Nuoro. The euros are coming from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst (up to €35000000) and the European Investment Bank (€25000000 via Invest EU) through a partnership between Breakthrough and the EU.

“This combined investment is an endorsement of Energy Dome’s ready-to-be-deployed long-duration energy storage proposition. Energy Dome’s robust performance (high round-trip efficiency) and capital expenditure requirements are significantly more competitive than the Lithium-Ion benchmark providing a solution to the critical problem of utility-scale long-duration energy storage which is at the core of the renewable energy transition” Energy Dome states.

The Sardinia project will consist of the company’s standardized 20-megawatt 200 megawatt-hour CO2 Battery. It meets the 10-hour long duration milestone described by the US Department of Energy among others.

“The CO2 Battery does not use materials from rare metals and its main components are based on already existing and known supply chains enabling job creation within Europe” Energy Dome adds.

$30 Million For Long Duration Energy Storage In Wisconsin

Commercial operation is expected by Q3 2024 for Energy Dome’s project in Italy. Meanwhile energy planners in Wisconsin are eagerly awaiting their own 20-megawatt CO2 Battery under the forthcoming Columbia Energy Storage Project. The plan is to submit project details to state regulators next year with an eye on beginning construction in 2025 at a site in the Town of Portage.

The project will be up and running in 2026 if all goes according to plan. That may have been a somewhat dicey proposition some years ago when Wisconsin had a rocky relationship with renewable energy in general and wind power in particular. More recently though the momentum has gone to the clean tech side.

In fact Wisconsin stakeholders are anticipating that the new storage system will serve as a model for replication all around the US and some heavy hitters are involved.

The lead US stakeholder behind the CO2 Battery project is the Wisconsin public utility Alliant Energy which received a grant of up to $30 million from the US Department of Energy for the Columbia project. In addition to funding from the Energy Department partners in the project include WEC Energy Group Madison Gas and Electric Shell Global Solutions US the California-based Electric Power Research Institute University of Wisconsin-Madison and Madison College.

“Guided by our purpose-driven strategy we continue to invest in cost-effective sustainable energy solutions for the customers and communities we proudly serve” enthused John Larsen Alliant CEO and board chair. “As we diversify our energy mix the added capacity and unique capabilities of energy storage solutions will strengthen our generation portfolio increase grid resilience improve reliability and help us continue to meet customer needs.”

More Long Duration Energy Storage For The USA

As another indication that the Wisconsin project is anticipated to be the first of many it was funded through the Energy Department’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations which launched in 2021 with a $25 billion mandate from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to “help scale the emerging technologies needed to tackle our most pressing climate challenges and achieve net zero emissions by 2050.”

OCED has set a high bar for the projects in its long duration energy storage portfolio. In addition to scooping more wind and solar energy into the grid long duration projects are expected to improve critical infrastructure emergency response grid stability and management systems and transmission systems with a particular focus on rural areas including communities where energy costs are high.

Long duration energy storage is also expected to help defer or outright avoid new costs associated with transformers substations and other transmission and distribution infrastructure. Providing for EV fast-charging stations is another priority among other tasks.

On top of all that projects that qualify for OCED funding have to submit a community benefits plan. OCED lists community and workforce engagement workforce investment energy and environmental justice and diversity equity inclusion and accessibility among the elements of a qualifying project.

The Columbia project “builds on an ongoing partnership between Alliant Energy Columbia County and the Ho-Chunk Nation by supporting their shared goals of advancing sustainable energy solutions and expanding economic opportunities” OCED explained in a funding announcement issued in September.

On the heels of announcing his next studio album Change The Game the great Cody Jinks has also announced a massive 2024 tour to go along with it.

In addition to the previously announced co-headlining tour with Turnpike Troubadours as well as the opening slot with the Luke Combs tour Cody will traveling across the country beginning next February. Kicking off on February 9th in Connecticut Cody will hit the road with support from Blackberry Smoke Doc Oliver The Steel Woods Erin Viancourt Ward Davis The Cadillac 3 and Calder Allen.

And the best part? This is all he has planed SO FAR…

For an artist whose built a career on authenticity Jinks calls his upcoming record set to drop on March 22nd the most honest thing he’s ever done.

“This is the most open and honest record I’ve ever recorded I laid everything out.”

Featuring the lead single “Outlaws & Mustangs” as well as the thoughtful “Sober Thing” where Jinks address his path to sobriety this album is primed to be one of the best of Jinks’ career (in a long line of great albums).

Of new single “Sober Thing” he says:

“I wrote ‘Sober Thing’ right after we finished the ‘Mercy’ album. I was giving up a twenty plus year affair with whiskey and every word of that song is true. I don’t remember writing some of my biggest songs but I damn sure remember writing that one.”

The project which was produced by Ryan Hewitt and Jinks’ longtime bassist Joshua Thompson will also feature a new version of Faith No More’s “Take This Bottle” with special guest Pearl Aday.

On Saturday the No. 7 Texas Longhorns went into Arlington and made the biggest statement possible in the Big 12 Championship against Oklahoma State.

After being viewed as one of the teams on the outside looking in of the College Football Playoff Texas ended up blowing the Cowboys out by a score of 49-21. The victory not only gave them their first Big 12 title since 2009 in what is their final year in the conference but it also solidified their spot in the College Football Playoff.

On Sunday the Longhorns were revealed to be the No. 3 seed and will be taking on the No. 2 seed Washington Huskies in the Allstate Sugar Bowl.

Washington got the best of Texas in last year's Alamo Bowl but while the Huskies won that game have an explosive offense this year and are the higher seed it is actually the Longhorns who are favored by four points according to ESPN.

Quinn Ewers throws a pass against Washington in the Alamo Bowl Daniel Dunn-USA TODAY Sports

On top of being four-point favorites ESPN's matchup predictor also gives the Longhorns a 68.4 percent chance of winning. Despite being the lower seed the Longhorns may actually have a bit more of a home-field advantage being that the game is being played in New Orleans.

There are quite a few storylines to look out for in this game for Texas fans as Texas' head coach Steve Sarkisian coached at Washington before taking the USC job. The two teams are also viewed as having a couple of the best wide-receiver groups in the country and it'll surely be elite-on-elite in terms of play callers as Kalen DeBoer is also one of the best offensive minds in college football.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb3RiYWxsemVicmFzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEyLzIwMjMtMjQtYm93bC1vZmZpY2lhdGluZy1hc3NpZ25tZW50cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2023-24 bowl officiating assignments – Football Zebras,"Football Zebras is obtaining the officiating assignments to the 2023-24 bowl games and reporting them here.

Bowls are distributed to the conferences in a manner than an officiating crew is not from one of the participating team’s conferences. The Power 5 conferences work at least 5 bowls each (including all the New Year’s Six and the National Championship). The Group of 5 conferences work 3 bowls each with one conference getting a fourth bowl. The National Championship game is officiated by the conference that does not have a school in the playoffs and this year the ACC gets the officiating honors.

Each conference has its own criteria for determining the officials assigned to a bowl game. In some cases a conference will consider its championship game to be equivalent to a bowl assignment and not give those officials another postseason game.

For the tables listed below all times are Eastern and the conference that assigns the officials for each game is listed in italics. To minimize errors in the listings names are as they were printed on the media flipcards this season which we hope did not introduce new errors.

Symbol criteria

Participation symbols are placed after the on-field officials (excluding alternates) and the replay staff and the following criteria apply:

Officials that were assigned alternates from last year’s bowls are not marked with a star.

The Mackie Development Program run by the NFL is a development program which the league uses as a hiring pool. Officials will attend meetings and shadow NFL officials during OTAs training camps and preseason games. The MDP also assigns officials to college invitational all-star games — Hula Bowl Senior Bowl Shrine Bowl and the Legacy Bowl — for evaluation purposes. Officials marked in these tables must have been in the preseason program or worked a college invitational game in the last 3 years. The NFL did not provide a list for 2023 development officials as they have in previous years but we have included those that worked the 2023 invitational games.

The rosters of the spring pro leagues (plus XFL coordinator Marvel July) for the XFL 2020 and 2023 and the USFL 2022-23 are included but officials who only worked the 2019 AAF are not included as of this year.

Conference championship assignments are indicated for non-alternate officials at the end of the 2023 season.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhbGxhc25ld3MuY29tL3Nwb3J0cy90ZXhhcy1sb25naG9ybnMvMjAyMy8xMi8wMy9ob3ctdG8td2F0Y2gtdGV4YXMtd2FzaGluZ3Rvbi1zdWdhci1ib3dsLW9kZHMtdGlja2V0cy1hbmQtbW9yZS_SAYsBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZGFsbGFzbmV3cy5jb20vc3BvcnRzL3RleGFzLWxvbmdob3Jucy8yMDIzLzEyLzAzL2hvdy10by13YXRjaC10ZXhhcy13YXNoaW5ndG9uLXN1Z2FyLWJvd2wtb2Rkcy10aWNrZXRzLWFuZC1tb3JlLz9vdXRwdXRUeXBlPWFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to watch Texas-Washington: Sugar Bowl odds tickets and more,"The No. 3 Texas Longhorns (12-1) are in the College Football Playoff for the first time and headed to the Superdome in New Orleans to face No. 2 Washington (13-0) in the Allstate Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1.

GOOGL,Alphabet Inc,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAzLzMtZ3JlZW4tZmxhZ3MtZm9yLWFscGhhYmV0cy1mdXR1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Green Flags for Alphabet’s Future,"The company has delivered solid growth this year and is an exciting buy heading into the new year.

As the world's fourth-most valuable company with a market cap of nearly $1.7 trillion it would be difficult to overlook Alphabet's (GOOG 0.37%) (GOOGL 0.47%) stock as a potential investment. The company's shares climbed 155% over the last five years outperforming the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 indices.

Potent brands such as Google Android YouTube Chrome and more attracted billions of users and have made it challenging for most consumers to go a single day without using an Alphabet product. The company's massive user base paved the way for it to become a powerhouse in digital advertising a sector projected to hit $680 billion in spending this year.

Alongside a promising venture into artificial intelligence Google's parent company is an attractive investment. So here are three green flags for Alphabet's future.

1. A recovering ad business

Macroeconomic headwinds in 2022 brought declines across the tech market. Spikes in inflation forced companies to introduce cost-cutting measures with advertising one of the first things to go. As Alphabet's digital ad business makes up the majority of its revenue the company was hit hard by market challenges. In the fourth quarter of 2022 Alphabet's revenue rose 1% year over year missing analysts' expectations by $440 million.

However easing inflation and various restructuring moves seem to have Alphabet's ad business back on a growth path. In its latest quarter (Q3 2023) the company posted revenue growth of 11% year over hitting close to $77 billion and beating Wall Street forecasts by $980 million. The solid gains came alongside 11% and 12% revenue rises in Google Search and YouTube ads.

Improvements in Alphabet's ad business are positive as we head into 2024 and could see the company flourish next year alongside other exciting ventures.

2. Alphabet has massive earnings potential in AI

The AI market exploded this year with the industry valued at $137 billion and projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030 (per Grand View Research). Countless companies restructured their businesses to prioritize AI development in an effort to carve out their place in the high-growth industry. While Alphabet is no stranger to the technology describing itself as seven years into its ""journey as an AI-first company"" the tech giant ramped up investment in the market in 2023.

Meanwhile the company has massive earnings potential in the sector. Alphabet has nine products with over a billion users with YouTube Android and the many platforms under Google presenting almost endless possibilities to monetize its AI venture.

The tech giant will launch a highly anticipated large language model in 2024 called Gemini. The platform is expected to be competitive against OpenAI's GPT-4 and could boost multiple areas of Alphabet's business. Gemini will likely allow Alphabet to bring advanced AI upgrades across its different services including more efficient advertising new AI tools through Google Cloud updated features on productivity platforms like Gmail and Google Docs improvements on YouTube and a Google Search experience that's closer to ChatGPT.

Alphabet has the user base brand recognition and funds to go far in AI. It could be wise to invest now before it's too late.

3. Stellar financial gains that make its stock a bargain

Alphabet's annual revenue soared 107% in the last five years. Comparatively Microsoft's rose 68% and Apple's 47% in the same period. Meanwhile Alphabet's operating income jumped 130% which is also higher than the same metric for competitors Microsoft or Apple. The company built a highly reliable business. Its significant market share in advertising might make it vulnerable to economic fluctuation but it is unlikely to affect growth over the long term.

Moreover Alphabet's year of recovery in 2023 saw its free cash flow increase by 30% to over $77 billion. The rise suggests the company has the funds to overcome any potential headwinds and continue investing in its business. Its performance this year also brought its price-to-free-cash-flow ratio to an attractive 23 which is a bargain compared to other Big Tech stocks.

Alphabet is by far the most affordable AI stock compared to its peers making it a screaming buy for anyone looking to invest in cloud computing or AI.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vaW52ZXN0b3JwbGFjZS5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi9nb29nLXN0b2NrLWFsZXJ0LWFscGhhYmV0LWlzLXNwZW5kaW5nLW1vbmV5LWluLWFsbC10aGUtd3JvbmctcGxhY2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GOOG Stock Alert: Alphabet Is Spending Money in All the Wrong Places,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xNC1iZXN0LW1vc3QtYWN0aXZlLXN0b2Nrcy0xMzE0MTMwNjUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,14 Best Most Active Stocks to Buy Now,"In this article we will take a look at the 14 best most active stocks to buy now.

The United States stocks market continues to rally with optimism related to interest rates. Investor confidence has been on an upward trajectory since the beginning of the month following another Federal Reserve meeting that kept interest rates unchanged at the same level they have been at since July. On November 28 Fed Governor Christopher Waller said that he’s “increasingly confident” that the monetary policy is in the right place to bring inflation down to 2%. Major stock indices have posted consecutive weeks of positive performance with the S&P 500 slated to have one of its best months since July 2022.

S&P 500 Index has gained 8.6% month-to-date while NASDAQ-100 Index has gone up 11.1% during the same period.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

In a sudden and unexpected move the Board of Directors of OpenAI fired the company’s CEO Sam Altman on November 17. It was followed by lengthy back and forth hiring and firing of two interim CEOs Sam Altman getting hired by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and ultimately the return of Sam Altman to the position of CEO with some changes to the Board of Directors on November 22.

As of Q3 2023 Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) shares was held by 146 hedge funds with the total shares held by these funds valued at $8.1 billion.

RiverPark Advisors an investment advisory firm made the following comment about Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its RiverPark Large Growth Fund Q3 2023 investor letter:

“UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover after a history of losses the company is now solidly profitable with the potential for substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 130 million users (by comparison Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services such as package and grocery delivery travel and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4.3 billion of unrestricted cash and $4.4 billion of investments the company’s enterprise value of $95 billion equates to just over 20x next year’s estimated free cash flow.”

This is what Wedgewood Partners an investment management company had to say about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Alphabet was a top contributor to performance as search revenues accelerated during their second quarter. This improved performance flies in the face of fears that demand for the Company's advertising inventory and core search functionality would be diluted by the Company's own generative-AI offerings and outside substitutes. Alphabet subsidiaries have been at the vanguard of artificial intelligence for more than a decade. The Company has spent almost $150 billion on research and development over just the past five years and today over 80% of the Company's advertising customers use an AI-enabled tool when they run their Google Search and YouTube campaigns. Thus Alphabet is certainly not ""behind the curve"" in any way shape or form when it comes to AI. Quite the contrary the Company has ample room to rationalize spending to drive better returns on investments and increase capital returns to shareholders at these relatively attractive forward earnings multiples.”

One of the biggest differences between iPhone and Android is the sheer amount of freedom afforded by the latter. Android users can download and install almost any app – from anywhere online. But now Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai has warned of the dangers of straying from the Google Play Store.

Pichai made the comments during a recent court hearing highlighting the security concerns of downloading apps from third-party stores. Google is currently embroiled in a legal battle with Epic Games the company behind the blockbuster hit Fortnite over the practices of its Google Play Store. ""We don’t want to allow you to completely compromise your phone. It can install malware on your phone. It can compromise your safety very significantly” Sundar Pichai said. If that seems like it'd be at odds with the customisable and open ethos behind Android the Google exec is well aware. ""We're trying to strike a balance"" he admits. ""Apple's iPhone only allows the App Store but we believe in choice. So on Android we allow you to sideload and install additional applications. It's like a seatbelt in a car. We are adding the protections so you can use it safely.""

Epic Games which is behind the global phenomenon Fortnite is challenging Google at trial GETTY IMAGES Epic Games sued Google back in 2020 over the 30% commission it takes from digital goods sold in the Google Play Store and in-app purchases made within apps and games. Epic Games claims Google's digital storefront which is preinstalled on every Android device with access to Google services like YouTube Gmail and Google Maps constitutes an unlawful monopoly.

The Fortnite developer wants Google to make third-party app stores installing apps from the internet and non-Google payment processing more accessible. Epic Games says these changes would make Android more welcoming to developers since they would be able to decide whether or not they wanted to distribute their apps and games in Google Play Store or a competing store on a level playing field. However Google argues that Epic Games' demands would prevent it from offering a secure user experience on Android because of the risks associated with allowing users to download software from anywhere. Google claims that dismantling the protections in place to stop Android users from installing apps from third-party sources (known as ""sideloading"") would hamper its ability to compete with iOS and it argues it would be unable to run a competitive app store without the revenue collected from the 30% cut from app sales and in-app purchases. If this all sounds a bit familiar it's likely because Epic Games has already taken Apple to court over its identical 30% cut of in-app purchases and other app store practices. That lawsuit went to court in the United States back in 2021 while a series of delays pushed back the date of the Google hearing.

Californian Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers concluded in September 2021 that Apple wasn't unfairly monopolising its in-app purchasing system. As a result Epic Games was ordered to pay damages for violating its developer agreement when it introduced a third-party payment system into Fortnite leading to its ban from the App Store on iPhone and iPad. However Judge Rogers also ordered Apple to remove its policy that banned developers from telling their users about alternatives to Apple’s in-app purchase system. The 30% cut taken by Apple and Google from their respective app stores only applies to digital goods. It's the reason you're able to order a takeaway book a train journey and rent a car from an app – but the Kindle app restricts the ability to purchase digital books to avoid giving a cut to Apple and Google.

As the world's fourth-most valuable company with a market cap of nearly $1.7 trillion it would be difficult to overlook Alphabet's (GOOG 0.37%) (GOOGL 0.47%) stock as a potential investment. The company's shares climbed 155% over the last five years outperforming the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 indices.

Potent brands such as Google Android YouTube Chrome and more attracted billions of users and have made it challenging for most consumers to go a single day without using an Alphabet product. The company's massive user base paved the way for it to become a powerhouse in digital advertising a sector projected to hit $680 billion in spending this year.

Alongside a promising venture into artificial intelligence Google's parent company is an attractive investment. So here are three green flags for Alphabet's future.

1. A recovering ad business

Macroeconomic headwinds in 2022 brought declines across the tech market. Spikes in inflation forced companies to introduce cost-cutting measures with advertising one of the first things to go. As Alphabet's digital ad business makes up the majority of its revenue the company was hit hard by market challenges. In the fourth quarter of 2022 Alphabet's revenue rose 1% year over year missing analysts' expectations by $440 million.

However easing inflation and various restructuring moves seem to have Alphabet's ad business back on a growth path. In its latest quarter (Q3 2023) the company posted revenue growth of 11% year over hitting close to $77 billion and beating Wall Street forecasts by $980 million. The solid gains came alongside 11% and 12% revenue rises in Google Search and YouTube ads.

Improvements in Alphabet's ad business are positive as we head into 2024 and could see the company flourish next year alongside other exciting ventures.

2. Alphabet has massive earnings potential in AI

The AI market exploded this year with the industry valued at $137 billion and projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030 (per Grand View Research). Countless companies restructured their businesses to prioritize AI development in an effort to carve out their place in the high-growth industry. While Alphabet is no stranger to the technology describing itself as seven years into its ""journey as an AI-first company"" the tech giant ramped up investment in the market in 2023.

Meanwhile the company has massive earnings potential in the sector. Alphabet has nine products with over a billion users with YouTube Android and the many platforms under Google presenting almost endless possibilities to monetize its AI venture.

The tech giant will launch a highly anticipated large language model in 2024 called Gemini. The platform is expected to be competitive against OpenAI's GPT-4 and could boost multiple areas of Alphabet's business. Gemini will likely allow Alphabet to bring advanced AI upgrades across its different services including more efficient advertising new AI tools through Google Cloud updated features on productivity platforms like Gmail and Google Docs improvements on YouTube and a Google Search experience that's closer to ChatGPT.

Alphabet has the user base brand recognition and funds to go far in AI. It could be wise to invest now before it's too late.

3. Stellar financial gains that make its stock a bargain

Alphabet's annual revenue soared 107% in the last five years. Comparatively Microsoft's rose 68% and Apple's 47% in the same period. Meanwhile Alphabet's operating income jumped 130% which is also higher than the same metric for competitors Microsoft or Apple. The company built a highly reliable business. Its significant market share in advertising might make it vulnerable to economic fluctuation but it is unlikely to affect growth over the long term.

Moreover Alphabet's year of recovery in 2023 saw its free cash flow increase by 30% to over $77 billion. The rise suggests the company has the funds to overcome any potential headwinds and continue investing in its business. Its performance this year also brought its price-to-free-cash-flow ratio to an attractive 23 which is a bargain compared to other Big Tech stocks.

Alphabet is by far the most affordable AI stock compared to its peers making it a screaming buy for anyone looking to invest in cloud computing or AI.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vaW52ZXN0b3JwbGFjZS5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi9nb29nLXN0b2NrLWFsZXJ0LWFscGhhYmV0LWlzLXNwZW5kaW5nLW1vbmV5LWluLWFsbC10aGUtd3JvbmctcGxhY2VzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GOOG Stock Alert: Alphabet Is Spending Money in All the Wrong Places,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xNC1iZXN0LW1vc3QtYWN0aXZlLXN0b2Nrcy0xMzE0MTMwNjUuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,14 Best Most Active Stocks to Buy Now,"In this article we will take a look at the 14 best most active stocks to buy now.

The United States stocks market continues to rally with optimism related to interest rates. Investor confidence has been on an upward trajectory since the beginning of the month following another Federal Reserve meeting that kept interest rates unchanged at the same level they have been at since July. On November 28 Fed Governor Christopher Waller said that he’s “increasingly confident” that the monetary policy is in the right place to bring inflation down to 2%. Major stock indices have posted consecutive weeks of positive performance with the S&P 500 slated to have one of its best months since July 2022.

S&P 500 Index has gained 8.6% month-to-date while NASDAQ-100 Index has gone up 11.1% during the same period.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA).

This is what Wedgewood Partners an investment management company had to say about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:

“Alphabet was a top contributor to performance as search revenues accelerated during their second quarter. This improved performance flies in the face of fears that demand for the Company's advertising inventory and core search functionality would be diluted by the Company's own generative-AI offerings and outside substitutes. Alphabet subsidiaries have been at the vanguard of artificial intelligence for more than a decade. The Company has spent almost $150 billion on research and development over just the past five years and today over 80% of the Company's advertising customers use an AI-enabled tool when they run their Google Search and YouTube campaigns. Thus Alphabet is certainly not ""behind the curve"" in any way shape or form when it comes to AI. Quite the contrary the Company has ample room to rationalize spending to drive better returns on investments and increase capital returns to shareholders at these relatively attractive forward earnings multiples.”

One of the biggest differences between iPhone and Android is the sheer amount of freedom afforded by the latter. Android users can download and install almost any app – from anywhere online. But now Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai has warned of the dangers of straying from the Google Play Store.

Pichai made the comments during a recent court hearing highlighting the security concerns of downloading apps from third-party stores. Google is currently embroiled in a legal battle with Epic Games the company behind the blockbuster hit Fortnite over the practices of its Google Play Store. ""We don’t want to allow you to completely compromise your phone. It can install malware on your phone. It can compromise your safety very significantly” Sundar Pichai said. If that seems like it'd be at odds with the customisable and open ethos behind Android the Google exec is well aware. ""We're trying to strike a balance"" he admits. ""Apple's iPhone only allows the App Store but we believe in choice. So on Android we allow you to sideload and install additional applications. It's like a seatbelt in a car. We are adding the protections so you can use it safely.""

Epic Games which is behind the global phenomenon Fortnite is challenging Google at trial GETTY IMAGES Epic Games sued Google back in 2020 over the 30% commission it takes from digital goods sold in the Google Play Store and in-app purchases made within apps and games. Epic Games claims Google's digital storefront which is preinstalled on every Android device with access to Google services like YouTube Gmail and Google Maps constitutes an unlawful monopoly.

The Fortnite developer wants Google to make third-party app stores installing apps from the internet and non-Google payment processing more accessible. Epic Games says these changes would make Android more welcoming to developers since they would be able to decide whether or not they wanted to distribute their apps and games in Google Play Store or a competing store on a level playing field. However Google argues that Epic Games' demands would prevent it from offering a secure user experience on Android because of the risks associated with allowing users to download software from anywhere. Google claims that dismantling the protections in place to stop Android users from installing apps from third-party sources (known as ""sideloading"") would hamper its ability to compete with iOS and it argues it would be unable to run a competitive app store without the revenue collected from the 30% cut from app sales and in-app purchases. If this all sounds a bit familiar it's likely because Epic Games has already taken Apple to court over its identical 30% cut of in-app purchases and other app store practices. That lawsuit went to court in the United States back in 2021 while a series of delays pushed back the date of the Google hearing.

Californian Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers concluded in September 2021 that Apple wasn't unfairly monopolising its in-app purchasing system. As a result Epic Games was ordered to pay damages for violating its developer agreement when it introduced a third-party payment system into Fortnite leading to its ban from the App Store on iPhone and iPad. However Judge Rogers also ordered Apple to remove its policy that banned developers from telling their users about alternatives to Apple’s in-app purchase system. The 30% cut taken by Apple and Google from their respective app stores only applies to digital goods. It's the reason you're able to order a takeaway book a train journey and rent a car from an app – but the Kindle app restricts the ability to purchase digital books to avoid giving a cut to Apple and Google.

The S&P 500 is the benchmark for the investing world. This well-known index comprises 500 of the largest and most visible corporations in the United States the world's leading economy.

It's also a great hunting ground for phenomenal long-term stock ideas to fit any investing strategy. Dividend investors are a large group with a specific investing strategy buying stocks that will help them build large income streams from dividends. Many of these dividend enthusiasts rely on these five generous dividend-paying S&P 500 stocks for their huge payouts.

Let's find out a bit more about these five stocks.

1. Altria Group

American tobacco giant Altria Group (MO 0.71%) has made millions for shareholders over the past century selling Marlboro cigarettes in the United States. The company's golden years are far behind it now that the general public is better informed about the dangers of smoking. Still the addictive properties of nicotine give Altria the pricing power to continue growing profits despite smoking rates declining since the 1960s.

Cigarettes are cheap to manufacture so the company has few operating expenses. Most of Altria's profits go to shareholders as dividends. The company's dividend payout ratio is roughly 80% of cash flow. Altria's raised the dividend 58 times over the past 54 years meaning investors are getting paid more over time. Shares offer a generous 9.3% dividend yield at today's share price.

2. AbbVie

Pharmaceuticals are a lucrative industry especially if the company manages to develop a blockbuster drug. Patents protect proprietary formulas from competition for several years and allow the company to benefit from its development efforts. AbbVie (ABBV -0.25%) was a significant benefactor for several years from the success of Humira the world's top-selling drug. Unfortunately its patent protection expired recently. But don't worry; the company used its Humira profits to build the rest of the company into a juggernaut and it has several other drugs ready or in development to take up the slack.

AbbVie has become a favorite among dividend investors. Not only is the yield juicy at 4.5% but the payout has also grown by an average of 17% annually over the past decade. The dividend payout ratio is still manageable at 42% of cash flow so investors could see a nice one-two combo of yield and dividend growth moving forward.

3. Verizon Communications

Virtually everyone in America has a cellphone or smartphone. The importance of smartphones to consumers' everyday lives has made telecommunications companies like Verizon Communications (VZ) more like utility companies. People seemingly pay their phone bills as religiously as their water or electricity. This creates steady revenue streams for Verizon which results in fertile ground for steady and increasing dividend payments.

Verizon must invest constantly in upgrading and maintaining its wireless network so investors should look at net income instead of cash flow to judge the dividend. Fortunately Verizon spends just half its earnings on the dividend so investors should be in good shape with its 7.1% dividend yield.

4. Philip Morris International

Marlboro is a worldwide brand but Altria only sells it in America. Philip Morris International (PM 0.36%) was spun off from Altria over a decade ago and owns international rights to Marlboro. That shortens its dividend history but Philip Morris has raised its dividend yearly as a public company. That streak currently stands at 15 years. The dividend payout ratio is high at 103% but profits could grow and bring that ratio down over the coming years.

How? Philip Morris has done a great job innovating and moving into growing nicotine categories. It developed IQOS a device that heats (but doesn't burn) tobacco to produce vapor. It also acquired Swedish Match which makes the Zyn brand of oral nicotine pouches. Philip Morris is bringing these opportunities to global markets including America so the stock has long-term growth potential.

5. AT&T

A small group of significant players dominates the U.S. wireless communications market. Verizon is second-largest to AT&T (T -0.17%) which holds a 47% share. Today AT&T is a different company from what it's been for most of the decade. It tried failed and exited the entertainment industry and is now concentrating on telecommunications again. The stock offers a dividend yield of more than 6.8%.

It's not all rosy. The company still carries $138 billion in long-term debt scars from its former entertainment ambitions. However the dividend payout ratio is back to under half of net income after management cut the dividend once to free up more money to pay off its debt. Financially AT&T seems back on its feet giving investors confidence to continue the dividends.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAzL2JyaXRpc2gtYW1lcmljYW4tdG9iYWNjby1zdG9jay1idXktc2VsbC1vci1ob2xkL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,British American Tobacco Stock: Buy Sell or Hold?,"High dividend yields are often too good to be true. But there are exceptions.

Today's resilient but slow-growth nature of the tobacco industry has made it a specialty niche for dividend investors. Where else can you routinely find massive-yield dividend stocks like British American Tobacco (BTI 0.52%) which offers an 8.7% yield at its current price?

But these high yields can sometimes be a trap a sign that Wall Street sees risk and wants to be compensated accordingly to own the stock. So where does British American Tobacco fall? Is its hefty dividend trustworthy? Is the stock a buy sell or hold? Here is what you need to know.

Can you trust the dividend?

In most cases the dividend is the primary reason for owning tobacco stocks so it's a great place to start. British American Tobacco or BAT pays a hefty dividend that yields over 8% at its current share price. That's huge because if you understand that the S&P 500 has historically averaged annualized returns between 9% and 10% that dividend establishes a high floor for investment returns.

Dividends are paid in cash so investors can look at BAT's cash flow to see how easily it's funding its payout. Fortunately the dividend payout ratio is at just 50%. Even looking back five years the dividend has never seriously threatened to exceed the business's cash profits.

That means investors can buy British American Tobacco for its dividend and remain confident that the payments will keep coming barring a collapse in the company that shrinks profits. This of course is a legitimate investment risk so it's time to dig deeper.

A growing and diverse business

A handful of major companies dominate the global tobacco market. You're already reading about BAT which competes with Altria and Philip Morris International. Altria sells Marlboro cigarettes in America and Philip Morris sells them internationally along with its IQOS (heated tobacco) and Zyn (oral nicotine) products.

British American Tobacco could be the most diverse among these three companies. You see it enjoys a breadth of products and markets it serves. The company sells combustible cigarette brands worldwide including Dunhill Lucky Strike and Pall Mall. Additionally it sells Camel Newport and Natural American Spirit exclusively in the United States.

Product-wise the industry is juggling the slowly declining (but still very lucrative) cigarette business and emerging smokeless products like heated tobacco and oral nicotine pouches. BAT covers its bases here too. It sells Vuse for vaping Glo for heated tobacco and Velo for oral nicotine.

These new category products will grow large enough to turn profitable next year. Presently the company should do about 27 billion pounds in revenue this year and about 3 billion pounds will come from smokeless products. Through six months of this year new category revenue was up 29% year over year so it looks like the company is successfully building up its next-generation products.

Earnings per share (EPS) grew 5.3% year over year in the first half of 2023. This doesn't look like a collapsing business; it is a growing business. Investors should feel good about the dividend and BAT's performance.

Is British American Tobacco a buy sell or hold?

Dividend investors probably don't have any fundamental reason to sell shares. But should you be buying? Valuation is essential because a great business can be a lousy stock if the price isn't right.

A company growing at a mid-single-digit pace shouldn't fetch a steep valuation so keep that in mind. With that said shares could still be cheap.

At a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just seven even a 5% growth rate translates to a reasonable price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of just 1.4. At worst that's a fair price to pay for the growth you're getting. Throw in that juicy well-funded dividend and the stock begins looking attractive.

The verdict? Dividend investors can buy British American Tobacco with confidence.",,,,,,,,,

Magie Tran teaches dual language math and science at Southwood Valley Elementary. Her principal Ali DeLuna nominated her for a contest Amazon and Illumination organized to promote their new movie “Migration.”

“This was one of those like moments that could have passed by but it didn’t. And so we found out that it was legit and I knew just to nominate Magie” DeLuna said.

DeLuna nominated Tran without her knowing keeping it a secret for over a month.

“I had to record a two three minute video of myself answering a few questions. I submitted it to my principal that’s all I knew she was like just trust me. This is something good” Tran said.

Tran ultimately won the prize and her fourth grade classroom took a field trip to the Amazon drone facility in College Station.

While they were there Tran was surprised with a truckload of tech for her classroom - like 3-D printers VR headsets and telescopes. To round off the surprise Tran’s husband and DeLuna surprised her with an all-expense paid vacation to Jamaica with her family.

“I still can’t believe I see myself in the video and I was like that’s really me” Tran said.

She said this gift will be life changing for her students.

”I was in tears immediately because those resources are so hard to get ahold of as you know as a title one school” Tran said “They were just so the most excited I’ve ever seen them.”

More supplies will be delivered to Tran at a later date.

Whether the Amazon transportation services agreement is eventually modified is unclear but Alaska Air Group’s CEO said it could spur further investment in freighters.

“For now nothing changes” said Hawaiian Airlines spokesman Alex Da Silva in an email.

Hawaiian Airlines in early October began flying an Airbus A330-300 converted freighter between Amazon’s air logistics superhub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport and its West Coast hub in San Bernardino California.

Under a contract inked late last year Amazon plans to lease nine more of the former passenger planes that are being overhauled to carry cargo containers and turn them over to Hawaiian to operate on its behalf in the domestic U.S. market.

The parent company of Alaska Airlines presumably contemplated that Amazon has warrants to take a 15% equity stake in Hawaiian Airlines after nine years conditioned on meeting a spending threshold of $1.8 billion. Operating freighters for the first time in a partnership with Amazon is a way for it to diversify its business.

Alaska Airlines has long operated a small fleet of freighter aircraft primarily between Alaska and the continental United States. It currently has four converted freighters — three Boeing 737-700s and one 737-800 it received last month.

Boeing is scheduled to deliver a second 737-800 passenger-to-freighter aircraft early next year. But the A330 a medium widebody aircraft is much larger than the 737 and would bring Alaska’s freighter fleet to 15 aircraft by early 2025.

“We will be closely assessing whether further dedicated freight or flying for ourselves or in an asset light model for others could make sense for the combined company over time” said Alaska Air CEO Ben Minicucci on a conference call with analysts.

“We haven’t had a ton of conversation with Amazon” he added. “We’re anxious to understand that more. We are the only passenger carrier in the U.S. industry that has dedicated freighter flying today removing from three aircraft of five. I think it’s an area of potential longer term opportunity for the company. And we’ll continue to watch to see if that type of flying makes more sense if there’s more of it.”

The Amazon partnership also gives Alaska Airlines a Midwest pilot base and more opportunities for pilots to fly widebody aircraft which offer more lucrative pay.

Story continues

“Alaska has a track record of operating a good freighter network and is also an airline known for strong operational reliability. However the executive team at Hawaiian was strong supporters of the Amazon deal. Many of those leaders may not survive the merger so Alaska executives will need to prove their commitment to Amazon for the long run” Derek Lossing the founder of Cirrus Global Advisors and former Amazon Logistics executive told FreightWaves.

Executives said on a call with investors that they expect the deal to provide $20 million in redundant savings from cargo operations associated with their respective passenger airlines which carry cargo in the lower hold as an adjunct business and potentially unlock further growth.

Bigger is better

The rationale for merging Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines stems from the fact that they are mid-tier carriers in a competitive US airline market where scale increasingly matters. The deal announced on Sunday would cement Alaska’s place as the fifth largest U.S. airline. Also Hawaiian has routes to Asia that give Alaska Airlines access to its first major international presence beyond limited flights to Mexico and Central America.

Alaska Airlines already flies to Hawaii but will offer expanded service there and count Honolulu as a major hub to tap into the lucrative vacation market there. Hawaiian customers benefit with more direct and one-stop service to more U.S. mainland destinations.

The companies said they will maintain their existing brands with a combined fleet of 365 aircraft. The Alaska and Hawaiian networks are highly complementary with only a 3% overlap. Alaska operates an all-Boeing narrowbody fleet while Hawaiian has a mixed fleet that includes 24 A330s and 18 Airbus A321neos.

Alaska appears to have received a good value for its money with the deal worth less than Hawaiian’s annual revenue and a price-to-earnings ratio of four.

During the first three quarters of 2023 Alaska Airlines generated $10.4 billion in revenue compared to $2.8 billion for Hawaiian.

The transaction is expected to close in 12 to 18 months pending approval by Hawaiian shareholders and antitrust regulators. But the Justice Department under the Biden administration has taken a hard line against industry consolidation in general including among airlines. The Justice Department’s antitrust lawsuit against JetBlue’s merger with Spirit Airlines is expected to wrap up in federal court this week.

Once I realized this was not a fluke but a trend I contacted Amazon directly. I wrote to Jeff Bezos. Yes I know he’s no longer running things but it seemed like a reasonable course of action. Here’s the email:

Subject: If you had to stand in line at the USPS to pick up your Amazon packages would you still order from Amazon?

Dear Mr Bezos –

That’s precisely the situation we’re experiencing.

We live full time on Orcas Island in Washington. We like most of the residents here do not have mail delivery to our home.

Up until this past year all our Amazon packages came to our house via Aeronautical Services a delivery company for UPS. But this year something changed and all our Amazon packages – be they one pound or 50 pounds – now are diverted to our small understaffed US Post Office in Eastsound.

Not only does this require we drive into Eastsound but it often requires we stand in line at the Post Office. Almost every single day.

Additionally many residents are elderly and can’t easily jockey a large awkward package from the PO to their cars and then to their homes.

Ordering from Amazon used to be a delightful convenience. Now it’s more trouble than it’s worth. Other vendors might charge a little more but if the packages come to my home they’ll get the orders.

Something to think about.

Thank you for opening this email and for any attention you can give to this situation.

Kindest regards

Rebecca McDonough"

The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee issued a news release saying it was ""deeply troubled"" by the incident which occurred on American Airlines flight 2829 from New York's JFK Airport to Phoenix.

The group said the passenger was given the option to hide the sweatshirt by turning it inside out or be removed from the plane by law enforcement.

The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee condemned American Airlines in the news release saying that actions like these make the Palestinian community feel silenced in a time of turmoil and uncertainty.

After a ceasefire fell apart on Friday the Gaza Health Ministry reported that at least 200 Palestinians had been killed according to the Associated Press. The group said that 15200 had died since the fighting began. According to USA TODAY about 1200 Israelis have died most of which were civilians killed during the deadly Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.

""The choice presented to the passenger reflects a distressing disregard for the fundamental rights of individuals to express their cultural and national identities"" the release said. ""This incident is emblematic of a larger pattern of discrimination that Palestinians and their supporters often face highlighting a concerning trend of silencing and marginalizing their voices.""

American Airlines released a statement to The Arizona Republic saying that they are looking into the matter and have reached out to the passenger to learn more about their experience and address their concerns.

""We strive to ensure all customers have a positive experience throughout their journey on American"" the statement said.

The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee has asked the airline to issue an apology to the passenger and to discuss this incident with the group to help avoid future issues.

Alaska Air Group will acquire Hawaiian Airlines in a major strategic shakeup for both carriers as they forge a path in the post-pandemic world. The deal is valued at $1.9 billion which includes Alaska’s offer for Hawaiian at $18 per share in cash and is inclusive of $900 million of Hawaiian’s net debt.

The deal reignites U.S. airline consolidation at a time when the appetite of political leaders to bless industry mergers remains in question. The Department of Justice is currently suing to block the union of JetBlue Airways and Spirit Airlines.

Alaska and Hawaiian will continue operating under separate brands and will create a combined fleet of 365 Boeing 737s 717s Airbus A321neos A330-200s and Embraer E175s. The scale of the new unified carrier fortifies Alaska’s fifth place position behind United Airlines Delta Air Lines American Airlines and Southwest Airlines who control more than 80% of the overall U.S. airline market.

The decision to maintain independent brands rooted in the identities of the 49th and 50th U.S. states differs from Alaska’s strategy of consolidating and phasing out Virgin America’s brand which it formally acquired in 2017.

The deal also marks a major shift in Alaska’s strategy giving the airline an increasingly complex overall fleet to manage including widebody aircraft for flying to destinations in Asia-Pacific at a time when Alaska is facing greater growth constraints in its key U.S. west coast markets. The Seattle-based carrier in September completed a major fleet simplification excising the last of its Airbus single-aisle fleet in a transaction for 10 A321neos to American Airlines. The deal will return 18 A321neos to Alaska Air Group’s fleet once the transaction is complete.



Hawaiian has struggled coming out of the pandemic with the exhaustion of pent-up leisure demand the devastating fires on Maui earlier this year and the tenuous availability of its Pratt & Whitney PW1100G-powered A321neo fleet with required inspections. The carrier is in the midst of a significant fleet transformation is expected to induct service with its first 787-9 in 2024 and had been expected to decide on a replacement for its workhorse interisland 717 feet by the end of 2023 or early 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3NhcmFkb3JuLzIwMjMvMTIvMDMvYWxhc2thLWFpcmxpbmVzLXdpbGwtYnV5LWhhd2FpaWFuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWZvci0xOS1iaWxsaW9uLWZhY2VzLWxpa2VseS1kb2otc2NydXRpbnkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alaska Airlines Will Buy Hawaiian Airlines For $1.9 Billion—Faces Likely DOJ Scrutiny,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2023/12/03/alaska-airlines-will-buy-hawaiian-airlines-for-19-billion-faces-likely-doj-scrutiny/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb3JiZXMuY29tL3NpdGVzL3NhcmFkb3JuLzIwMjMvMTIvMDMvYWxhc2thLWFpcmxpbmVzLXdpbGwtYnV5LWhhd2FpaWFuLWFpcmxpbmVzLWZvci0xOS1iaWxsaW9uLWZhY2VzLWxpa2VseS1kb2otc2NydXRpbnkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8wMy9hbGFza2EtYWlyLWFncmVlcy10by1idXktaGF3YWlpYW4tYWlybGluZXMtdHJhdmVsL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alaska Air agrees to buy struggling Hawaiian Airlines in a $1.9 billion deal,"Alaska Air Group Inc. has agreed to buy rival Hawaiian Holdings Inc.’s Hawaiian Airlines in a $1.9 billion deal to combine the two carriers challenging the Biden administration’s aggressive stance on mergers that has already derailed one partnership.

Alaska will pay $18 per share in cash in a deal that includes about $900 million of Hawaiian’s debt according to a statement Sunday. The offer is a significant premium to Hawaiian Holdings’ $4.86 closing share price on Friday.

The deal could provide a valuable lifeline to Hawaiian whose stock has tumbled more than 52% this year. The company has been hurt by the slow return of tourism between Asia and Hawaii following the pandemic and a ramp up in growth in the Hawaii-to-US market by Southwest Airlines Co.

Alaska is taking on the acquisition despite the Justice Department filing a record number of challenges last year to corporate combinations and a pending antitrust challenge to a separate airline deal. A federal antitrust lawsuit over JetBlue Airways Group Inc.’s $3.8 billion cash takeover of Spirit Airlines Inc. is nearing a close.

Federal regulators earlier this year succeeded in breaking up an alliance in the northeastern US between JetBlue and American Airlines Group Inc. after a federal judge found the partnership gave the carriers too much power in certain markets and harmed consumers by raising fares and limiting choices.

It’s not Alaska’s first experience with an acquisition. The carrier outbid JetBlue to acquire Virgin America Inc. in 2016 for $2.6 billion in cash to extend a stretch of consolidation that had occurred across the industry.

The combination with Hawaiian will add to Alaska’s earnings within two years of closing and will produce annual run-rate savings of $235 million according to the statement.

The acquisition must be approved by the boards of both airlines Hawaiian Holdings shareholders and regulators. It’s expected to close in 12 to 18 months the carriers said."

Experts say if an intense winter storm hits Oklahoma this year many Oklahomans could face power outages and blackouts like they did back in February of 2021 when an extreme winter storm caused power outages for days throughout the state.

Oklahoma is one of several states that could fall s

hort of electricity during extreme winter weather

""About two-thirds of the country is at risk for outages including Oklahoma"" said National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) CEO Jim Matheson ""The reason is pretty simple and that is that we're using more and more electricity demand is growing but supply is not keeping up.""



What's causing the demand to continue to grow? Matheson says technology

""Think about all the things you plug in in your home all the use of computer storage now"" he said ""So these data storage facilities and computer farms data farms we're needing more and more electricity in this country every day.""



Matheson says the increase in energy demand is a good thing but the country needs additional electricity capacity to keep up

""It means our economy is growing it means technology is giving us new opportunities"" said Matheson ""But we've got to make sure that we build new electric generation capacity to keep up with that.""



Experts say this is a trend that has been going on for a few years

""If that trend continues then the risk becomes greater and greater every year"" Matheson said ""The trend has taken us in the wrong direction. And we need some public policy changes to allow for building additional electricity capacity in this country. That's how we get out of this risky situation.""

Matheson says the best way to get ahead of the problem before it becomes a greater one is to talk to elected officials

""This isn't a red or a blue issue is it... everybody uses electricity in this country"" said Matheson ""We got to make sure our policymakers understand that we need reasonable public policy that allows us to build things in this country to power our economy. It's that simple.""

To prepare for potential power outages this winter experts say to keep extra batteries on hand as well as flashlights and candles.

U.S. Special Envoy John Kerry announced that America was joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance which means the Biden Administration commits to building no new coal plants and phasing out existing plants. No date was given for when the existing plants would have to go but other Biden regulatory actions and international commitments already in the works had meant no coal by 2035.

“We will be working to accelerate unabated coal phase-out across the world building stronger economies and more resilient communities” Kerry said in a statement. “The first step is to stop making the problem worse: stop building new unabated coal power plants.”

Coal power plants have already been shutting down across the nation due to economics and no new coal facilities were in the works so “we were heading to retiring coal by the end of the decade anyway” said climate analyst Alden Meyer of the European think-tank E3G. That’s because natural gas and renewable energy are cheaper so it was market forces he said.

As of October just under 20% of the U.S. electricity is powered by coal according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The amount of coal burned in the United States last year is less than half what it was in 2008.

Coal produces about 211 pounds (96 kilograms) of heat-trapping carbon dioxide per million BTUs of energy produced compared to natural gas which produces about 117 pounds (53 kilograms) and gasoline which is about 156 pounds (71 kilograms) according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

The U.S. had been pushing other nations especially China and India which are building new coal plants pell-mell to get rid of the fuel which causes more heat-trapping carbon emissions than other power systems.

Saturday’s action “sends a pretty powerful international signal that the U.S. is putting its money where its mouth is” Meyer said.

The Powering Past Coal Alliance started six years ago and had 50 country members until Saturday when the United States and six others joined said alliance spokeswoman Anna Drazkiewicz. Others joining Saturday include the Czech Republic and the Dominican Republic.

“Energy transition is not an easy task and as such requires strong cooperation and support” said Kosovo environment minister Artane Rizvanolli. “Joining the Powering Past Coal Alliance reiterates Kosovo’s clear commitment and ongoing efforts towards a socially just and clean energy sector.”

Our holiday lights burn so bright you can see them from space. Americans use more energy to power their holiday lights by one estimate than the nation of El Salvador uses for everything in a whole year. The juice that animates our 15-foot inflatable blinking Rudolphs and our 20-foot 1200-bulb flagpole trees could cool 14 million refrigerators.

Many Americans – and some entire neighborhoods – are expending more energy than ever on their holiday yard displays: Staging them earlier running them later and leaving no patch of turf unilluminated.

“People start decorating like right after Halloween now” said Bianca Soriano a spokesperson for Florida Power and Light. “If you start on Nov. 1 and let’s say you keep them on till New Year’s that’s two months of extra energy.”

Want to know how much power those holiday lights use? There's a formula for that

The average household spent an estimated $16.48 powering holiday lights in 2022 nearly $2 more than in 2021 according to an analysis by the Today’s Homeowner website.

There are ways to predict those costs. Kiplinger the personal finance site offers a wonderfully geeky formula to calculate a holiday power bill:

(wattage/1000 x time in hours) x cost per kWh in cents = cost to run Christmas lights

For those who find formulas off-putting Duke Energy provides a less math-intense alternative.

If you plan to string five strands of C9 2-inch incandescent lights 500 bulbs in all and run them six hours a day you will spend $63 in the holiday month according to Duke’s calculator.

If you switch to energy-efficient LED bulbs the same monthlong display will cost only $9. And if you downsize to Mini-LED bulbs the ones shaped like tiny candles your cost drops to 60 cents.

A 2008 study from the Department of Energy found that seasonal lights alone consumed 6.6 billion kilowatt hours of electricity in 2007.

That’s more energy than the nation of El Salvador used in a year at the time according to a report by Todd Moss executive director of the Energy for Growth Hub an energy-equity think tank. His 2015 piece went viral. Backlash followed.

“People on the left said ‘You should stop wasting all that electricity’ and people on the right said ‘You’re trying to kill Christmas’” Moss said.

Moss notes that the 6.6 billion kilowatt figure “has probably gone down since then because lighting’s gotten a lot more efficient.” But he also notes a distinct escalation in the holiday light wars at least in his neighborhood outside the District of Columbia.

“People go all out really cover their whole house” he said.

Want to cut power costs for your holiday lights? Go LED

The big takeaway here if you’re looking to save power while still staging a Clark Griswold-sized holiday spectacle is to go LED.

LED bulbs use at least 75% less energy and last up to 25 times longer than old-school incandescent lights according to the Department of Energy.

To illustrate the difference ComEd calculated how much Clark Griswold himself might have saved with LED lights.

You may recall that the Griswold patriarch of ""National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation"" set out to stage the brightest house on the block armed with 25000 Italian twinkle lights.

With incandescent bulbs burning five hours a day for a month ComEd calculates that display would cost the Griswolds $7462 in today’s dollars.

With LED lights the price comes down to $1612 still a surprisingly large sum.

But that’s the movies.

“I don’t know anyone who’s putting up 25000 lights” said James Gherardi spokesperson for Exelon parent company of ComEd.

Here are more energy-saving tips which you use beyond the holidays to save money. Try some of them inside and outside your home.

Don’t be in such a hurry to put up your holiday display

Soriano of FPL has noticed that her South Florida neighbors seem to deck the halls ever earlier in recent years.

Two months of holiday lights cost more than one month. You may even annoy your more holiday-averse neighbors by rolling out the lights in November. Why not wait awhile?

Consider solar power

Solar-powered holiday lights might cost a bit more (roughly $40 for this four-pack on Amazon) but they can save you electrical costs in the long run.

Also as Popular Mechanics reports solar can spare you the hassle of running wires to outlets. Here are the magazine’s top solar picks.

Put your holiday lights on a timer

Time them to go on at sunset and off at bedtime. No one will notice them at noon. No one will be around to see them at 3 in the morning.

Rethink that inflatable Santa

Inflatables abound in millennial holiday displays but they come with a price.

“Inflatables use a lot of energy” Soriano said. “You hear that fan running.”

Your standard 8-foot inflatable costs 4 cents per hour or about a dollar a day in electricity if it’s running 24-7 according to Landmark Creations maker of custom inflatables.

“If you’ve got five – you’ve got Santa a reindeer a Grinch – every one of those is going to add to your electricity use” Soriano said.

Beware of phantom power

Holiday decorations with electronic components can use energy even when they appear to be off a quotient of wasted power that our Energy Department terms a “phantom load.”

For large and complex displays consider using a “smart” power strip which shuts off the power completely when you hit the switch.

This is the worst day worst airport:What to know for a smooth holiday flight

Turn the lights off if you leave town

This tip raises a philosophical question: Is your holiday light display for you or your neighbors?

Turning everything off when you fly to Tulum on Christmas Eve is “kind of a bummer” Gherardi said “because you want to see your house in its holiday form the entire month of December.”

But turning off the lights is certainly safer than leaving them on when you are away. And if you want to save a few bucks on power this is a great way to do it.

Set a New Year’s resolution to take the lights down

The weekend after New Year’s Day makes a fine time to roll up your lights and deflate your elves.

Think about it: Is anything sadder than a wilted yard Santa in February?"

Statement credits are typically received within a few days however it may take 90 days after an eligible prepaid hotel booking is charged to the Card Account. American Express relies on the merchant’s processing of transactions to determine the transaction date. The transaction date may differ from the date you made the purchase if for example there is a delay in the merchant submitting the transaction to us or if the merchant uses another date as the transaction date. This means that in some cases your purchase may not earn the statement credit benefit for the benefit period in which you made the purchase. For example if an eligible purchase is made on December 31st but the merchant processes the transaction such that it is identified to us as occurring on January 1st then the statement credit available in the next calendar year will be applied. Statement credits may not be received or may be reversed if the booking is cancelled or modified. If the Card Account is canceled or past due it may not qualify to receive a statement credit. If American Express does not receive information that identifies your transaction as eligible you will not receive the statement credits. For example your transaction will not be eligible if it is a booking: (i) made with a property not included in the Fine Hotels + Resorts or The Hotel Collection programs (ii) not made through American Express Travel or (iii) not made with an eligible Card. Participating properties and their availability are subject to change. If American Express in its sole discretion determines that you have engaged in or intend to engage in any manner of abuse misuse or gaming in connection with this benefit American Express will not have an obligation to provide and may reverse any statement credits provided to you. If a charge for an eligible purchase is included in a Pay Over Time balance on your Card Account the statement credit associated with that charge may not be applied to that Pay Over Time balance. Instead the statement credit may be applied to your Pay In Full balance.

Thanks to its incredible flexibility Amex Membership Rewards is one of the most valuable travel rewards programs around.

It boasts well over a dozen airline transfer partners. And now there’s a 25% transfer bonus to one of its partners JetBlue TrueBlue.

Here are all of the details of this new Amex transfer bonus and a look at whether you should take advantage.

Transfer Bonus From Amex to TrueBlue

Typically American Express Membership Rewards transfer to JetBlue TrueBlue at a 1:0.8 ratio. However if you transfer your points between now and November 30 2023 you’ll receive a 25% bonus when you transfer at least 250 points.

That means for every 250 Membership Rewards points you transfer you’ll get 250 JetBlue TrueBlue points. This transfer bonus is automatic so you don’t need to sign up for anything. You can transfer up to a maximum of 999000 points and transfers are usually instant although be aware that they can take up to 2 days.

Image Credit: American Express

Transfers from Amex to U.S. frequent flyer programs such as TrueBlue are subject to a federal excise tax of 0.06 cents per transferred point up to a $99 maximum.

Is It A Good Deal?

TrueBlue is a fixed-value rewards program meaning the number of points you’ll need to redeem is directly tied to the cash cost of the ticket.

Usually you’ll receive somewhere around 1.3 cents to 1.5 cents per point in value on your JetBlue redemptions. So while this transfer bonus is certainly helpful for some travelers it’s also not the most optimal way to redeem Amex points which are valued at around 2.2 cents apiece.

Hot Tip: JetBlue is a 1:1 transfer partner of Chase Ultimate Rewards and Citi ThankYou Rewards so this limited-time transfer bonus from American Express actually matches what these other programs already offer.

Final Thoughts

It’s always nice to see a transfer bonus to an airline or hotel program. We typically focus on covering high-value deals but this transfer bonus may be helpful for some who are on the cusp of making a redemption with the TrueBlue program and just need a few more points to push them over the threshold of what’s needed.

So while this is certainly a way to extract more value from your points and values it’s not the best way to use your Amex points if you hope to redeem them for the most value possible.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL3NlbGVjdC9lbmRzLXNvb24tZWFybi11cC10by0xMDAwMDAtYm9udXMtcG9pbnRzLXdpdGgtYW1leC1idXNpbmVzcy1wbGF0aW51bS_SAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvc2VsZWN0L2VuZHMtc29vbi1lYXJuLXVwLXRvLTEwMDAwMC1ib251cy1wb2ludHMtd2l0aC1hbWV4LWJ1c2luZXNzLXBsYXRpbnVtLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New welcome offer: Earn 100000 bonus points with Amex Business Platinum Card,"Offers mentioned below are no longer available.

“Today there were four attacks against three separate commercial vessels operating in international waters in the southern Red Sea” the statement from the US Central Command reads. “We have every reason to believe that these attacks while launched by the Houthis in Yemen are fully enabled by Iran.”

The Carney a US destroyer responded to distress calls and provided assistance following missile and drone launches from Houthi-controlled territory according to US Central Command. It named the vessels attacked as Unity Explorer Number 9 and Sophie II.

Yemen’s Houthi movement said its navy had attacked two ships Unity Explorer and Number 9 with an armed drone and a naval missile and claimed the vessels were Israeli. A spokesperson for the group’s military said the two ships were targeted after they rejected warnings without elaborating.

In a broadcast statement the spokesperson said the attacks were in response to the demands of the Yemeni people and calls from Islamic nations to stand with the Palestinian people.

The US military said the Carney shot down two drones as it helped the commercial vessels. It was not clear if the warship was a target. It said the attacks were a threat to international commerce.

Israeli military spokesperson R Adm Daniel Hagari said the ships had “no connection to the state of Israel”. Hagari said: “One ship was significantly damaged and it is in distress and apparently is in danger of sinking and another ship was lightly damaged.”

US Central Command said Unity Explorer is Bahamas-flagged and UK-owned that Number 9 is Panamanian-flagged Bermuda- and UK-owned and operated and Sophie II is Panamanian-flagged.

Yemen’s Houthis who have the backing of Iran have launched several missile and drone attacks on Israel since the start of the war in Gaza on 7 October. They are not thought to have inflicted any serious damage.

More recently the rebel group has stepped up its targeting of commercial vessels sailing in the Red Sea which lies south of the Suez Canal a strategic naval route between Europe and Asia and east Africa.

Separately a US airstrike killed five Iraqi militants near the northern city of Kirkuk as they prepared to launch explosive projectiles at US forces in the country three Iraqi security sources said identifying them as members of an Iran-backed militia.

A US military official confirmed a “self-defence strike on an imminent threat” that targeted a drone staging site near Kirkuk on Sunday afternoon.

A statement by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq an umbrella group representing several Iraqi armed factions with close ties to Tehran said five of its members had been killed and vowed retaliation against US forces.

The group had claimed several attacks against US forces throughout Sunday. Earlier on Sunday the US military official said US and international forces were attacked with multiple rockets at the Rumalyn landing zone in north-eastern Syria but there were no casualties or damage to infrastructure.

Iraqi armed groups have claimed more than 70 such attacks against US forces since 17 October over Washington’s backing of Israel in its bombardment of Gaza.

A fortnight ago the Houthis released dramatic video of masked gunmen seizing the Galaxy Leader a British-owned and Japanese-operated cargo ship after landing a helicopter on deck. The group claimed it was owned by Israel but there was no immediate evidence to support this.

A week later towards the end of November a US warship the USS Mason seized five attackers who had tried to take control of the Central Park a commercial tanker that had been carrying a cargo of phosphoric acid.

In the incident two ballistic missiles were fired from Houthi-controlled areas in Yemen toward the general location of the two ships but landed 10 nautical miles away in the Gulf of Aden the US military said.

On Sunday maritime security specialists told Reuters that an unnamed bulk carrier ship had been hit by at least two drones in the Red Sea. One company Ambrey said another container ship had reportedly suffered damage from a drone attack about 63 miles north-west of the northern Yemeni port of Hodeidah.

Earlier Britain’s Maritime Trade Operations agency said it had received reports of a drone attack in the Red Sea’s Bab el-Mandab strait between Yemen Djibouti and Eritrea. The body called on vessels in the vicinity to exercise caution.

In mid-October the USS Carney shot down three ground-launched missiles as well as several drones that were fired by Houthi militants the Pentagon said. At the time the US said the missiles were “potentially heading towards Israel” as justification for its action.

HAYES ANNOUNCED AS USWNT HEAD COACH

After a worldwide search process led U.S. Soccer Sporting Director Matt Crocker Hayes was officially announced as the 10th head coach in U.S. Women’s National Team history on November 14. The long-time head coach for English powerhouse Chelsea FC Hayes started her coaching career in the United States in the early 2000s and more than two decades later will take the helm of the USWNT. Due to her contact with Chelsea Hayes will finish the 2023-24 Women’s Super League season in England and then join the U.S. team officially two months prior to the start of the 2024 Olympics. U.S. Soccer has put a comprehensive plan and process in place to maximize the productivity in all aspects of moving the USWNT forward leading into the Olympics a key part of which is interim head coach Twila Kilgore continuing in her role and then joining Hayes’ staff full-time as an assistant coach in late May.

TWENTY-SIX CALLED UP TO CLOSE OUT 2023

Kilgore who will guide the USWNT for the next five months named a roster for these final matches of 2023 that includes just thirteen players from 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup and five – Abby Dahlkemper Tierna Davidson Lindsey Horan Rose Lavelle and Emily Sonnett – who were on the 2019 Women’s World Cup championship team.

The roster includes two midfielders – 2023 NWSL Rookie of the Year Jenna Nighswonger and Paris Saint-Germain’s Korbin Albert – selected for their first full national team training camp. The roster also marks the return of several veterans in Lavelle who makes her first roster since the 2023 World Cup after overcoming injury Davidson who suffered a facial injury that kept her out of the USWNT’s October Camp and Dahlkemper who returns to her first U.S. roster since April of 2022 after recovering from major back surgery to help the San Diego Wave win the 2023 NWSL regular season title.

Kilgore and her staff will select 23 players to suit up for Saturday’s match in Ft. Lauderdale.

DOMINANT DEFENSE

Coming off two more clean sheets in the October matches against Colombia the USWNT enters Saturday’s match at DRV PNK Stadium having allowed just two goals this year which came against Brazil in the 2023 SheBelieves Cup finale on Feb. 22 and against the Netherlands in the World Cup group stage on July 27. With just the two goals allowed through 16 matches for a rate of 0.13 goals allowed per match the U.S. is on pace to break the current single-year program record (min. 10 games) of 0.40 goals allowed per match which was set in 2016 when the USA allowed 10 goals in 25 matches. With now just two games remaining on the schedule for 2023 the USA will set a new single-year record if it allows fewer than six goals over the final two matches of the year.

The USA has kept 14 shutouts this year nine credited to Alyssa Naeher and five to Casey Murphy. Along with stellar goalkeeping the USA defense has been dominant allowing just two shots on goal during the entire 2023 World Cup. The USA held South Africa to just one shot on goal combined in the two September friendlies and limited Colombia to two shots on target in each of the matchups last month. Center back Naomi Girma who won NWSL Rookie and Defender of the Year honors in 2022 and repeated as Defender of the Year in 2023 has started 14 games this year for the USWNT while outside back Emily Fox has started 13 and is second on the team with 1236 total minutes played in 2023.

Overall the USA has allowed just 21 total shots on goal in 16 matches so far this year the fewest in any complete year (min. 10 games) since at least 2017 and the fewest overall since 2020 when the USA allowed 15 shots on goal in nine matches as the international calendar was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Ford (CVN 78) and embarked staff from Carrier Strike Group (CSG) 12 arrived in Souda Bay Crete for a scheduled port visit Dec 2 2023.

This port visit is the capital ship’s sixth stop while deployed to the U.S. Naval Forces Europe (NAVEUR) area of operations. The port call will offer Gerald R. Ford Sailors the opportunity to experience the rich history and culture of Greece and enhance the strong partnership between the U.S. and Greece.

“The crew has been laser-focused on the mission and I am really proud of our Sailors’ work and efforts these past couple of months as our nation’s capital ship has remained on scene and prepared to do our duty” said Capt. Rick Burgess Commanding Officer of Gerald R. Ford. “The team has earned some time off and looks forward to taking in Greek culture and exploring Souda Bay Chania and the surrounding area. Earlier this summer Gerald R. Ford visited Piraeus and Athens and the port visit remains one of the highlights of our deployment because of the hospitality of our cherished Ally.”

The U.S. Navy routinely operates with Greece sending its largest aircraft carrier in the fleet to Souda Bay just four months after it visited Piraeus. Since Piraeus the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group (GRFCSG) conducted three steaming exercises with the Hellenic Navy and hosted the commanding officers of HS Elli (F-450) and HS Psara (F-454) aboard the flagship Gerald R. Ford. On Nov. 28 Psara joined the strike group to conduct joint and combined training in the Mediterranean Sea.

Gerald R. Ford’s most recent port visit in theater was in Trieste Italy Sept. 17-21. The ship deployed from Norfolk Virginia on May 2 and has been conducting training exercises and operations to support maritime stability and security in defense of U.S. Allied and partner interests.

Gerald R. Ford is the U.S. Navy’s newest and most advanced aircraft carrier. As the first-in-class ship of Ford-class aircraft carriers CVN 78 represents a generational leap in the U.S. Navy’s capacity to project power on a global scale. Ford-class aircraft carriers introduce 23 new technologies including Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System Advanced Arresting Gear and Advanced Weapons Elevators. The new systems incorporated onto Ford-class ships are designed to deliver greater lethality survivability and joint interoperability with a 20% smaller crew than a Nimitz-class carrier paving the way forward for naval aviation.

The Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group (GRFCSG) is conducting a scheduled deployment in U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa/U.S. Sixth Fleet area of operations demonstrating the commitment and power projection capability of the Navy’s globally deployed force. The GRFCSG provides an inherently flexible naval force capable of deploying across combatant commands to meet emerging missions deter potential adversaries reassure allies and partners enhance security and guarantee the free flow of global commerce. In total the GRFCSG is deployed with more than 6000 Sailors across all platforms ready to respond globally to combatant commander tasking.

Credit: Belga / Dirk Waem

In a bold move that has sparked heated debates plans to drastically renovate Antwerp's historic Boerentoren an iconic tower in the centre of the city that opened in 1932 continue to cause high-profile tensions.

Now a year since the top executive of Katoen Natie (the company that owns the building) Fernand Huts unveiled the plan the proposal has received staunch opposition from the Flemish Government Architects and architectural historian Francis Strauven among others.

Led by the renowned American architect Daniel Libeskind the plan envisions a modern transformation including a glass diamond-shaped construction crowning the tower.

But a recent opinion piece published in De Standaard features signatures from all Flemish Government Architects including current Government Architect Erik Wieërs and his four predecessors. They argue that the Boerentoren a landmark with deep historical roots should not be subjected to a contemporary overhaul.

Strauven told the newspaper ""The Boerentoren is a static icon that refers to its surroundings. There's no need to pour a contemporary sauce over that."" Meanwhile Wieërs criticises Huts for disregarding the advice of Christian Rapp Antwerp’s Bouwmeester and the city official in charge of public space urban planning and architecture.

""Fernand Huts had a number of architects make a proposal and chose someone. In my opinion someone has been chosen who will work with the tower in the most extreme way. The Bouwmeester's advice was never followed"" Wieërs wrote.

Despite being a private initiative the Boerentoren renovation project receives government subsidies prompting Wieërs to assert in De Standaard ""It is a heritage project that the Flemish government subsidises. In that sense we are involved and concerned as a community and it is relevant that we say something about it.""

The conflict extends beyond architects and government officials reaching citizens and cultural figures in Antwerp. Some appreciate the innovative design acknowledging the evolving nature of heritage. Others however fear the loss of historical identity.

City councillor for Urban Development Annick De Ridder told the newspaper that she remains cautious emphasising the need for a thorough assessment by various public services. City councillor Niel Staes said that he advocates for citizen involvement in the decision-making process drawing parallels to previous urban debates.

As the controversy unfolds the fate of the Boerentoren hangs in the balance with citizens architects and officials grappling with the delicate balance between preserving history and embracing the future.

Bologna’s Garisenda tower has been locked down for fear it could collapse. Authorities have provided a security cordon in case of collapse.The Garisenda tower along with the Asinelli(97meters)tower is one of the beauties and attractions for tourists visiting Bologna and a landmark for citizens. (Michele Nucci Lapresse Via AP)

MILAN (AP) — Officials have secured the area around one of two 12th Century towers that have become symbolic of the northern city of Bologna fearing its leaning could lead to collapse.

The city on Friday announced 4.3 million euros ($4.7 million) in works to shore up the Garisenda tower one of the so-called Two Towers that look out over central Bologna providing inspiration over the centuries to painters and poets and a lookout spot during conflicts. Work will proceed during January and February.

Italy’s civil protection agency has maintained a yellow alert on the site denoting caution but not imminent danger.

The Garisenda the shorter of two towers built between 1109 and 1119 currently stands 48 meters (157 feet) feet to the Asinelli’s 97 meters (320 feet). Mayor Matteo Lepore noted in a debate earlier this month that the Garisenda tower has leaned since it was built “and has been a concern ever since.” It sustained additional damage in the medieval era when ironwork and bakery ovens were built inside.

“We inherited a situation that over the centuries has caused this illness’’ he said. The mayor has asked the government to petition to make the towers UNESCO world heritage sites.

Work to reinforce both towers has been ongoing since the 1990s. Preliminary work on the Garisenda tower will include creating a containment area to prevent any damage to nearby structures or harm to passersby from a “possible collapse’’ the city said in a statement. Video cameras will maintain surveillance of the site.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JsZC1ldXJvcGUtNjc2MDQ1OTHSATJodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY29tL25ld3Mvd29ybGQtZXVyb3BlLTY3NjA0NTkxLmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paris attack near Eiffel Tower leaves one dead and two injured,

(AP) — A small western Pennsylvania water authority was just one of multiple organizations breached in the United States by Iran-affiliated hackers who targeted a specific industrial control device because it is Israeli-made U.S. and Israeli authorities say.

“The victims span multiple U.S. states” the FBI the Environmental Protection Agency the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency known as CISA as well as Israel’s National Cyber Directorate said in an advisory emailed to The Associated Press late Friday.

They did not say how many organizations were hacked or otherwise describe them.

Matthew Mottes the chairman of the Municipal Water Authority of Aliquippa which discovered it had been hacked on Nov. 25 said Thursday that federal officials had told him the same group also breached four other utilities and an aquarium.

Cybersecurity experts say that while there is no evidence of Iranian involvement in the Oct. 7 attack into Israel by Hamas that triggered the war in Gaza they expected state-backed Iranian hackers and pro-Palestinian hacktivists to step up cyberattacks on Israeli and its allies in its aftermath. And indeed that has happened.

The multiagency advisory explained what CISA had not when it confirmed the Pennsylvania hack on Wednesday — that other industries outside water and water-treatment facilities use the same equipment — Vision Series programmable logic controllers made by Unitronics — and were also potentially vulnerable.

Those industries include “energy food and beverage manufacturing and healthcare” the advisory says. The devices regulate processes including pressure temperature and fluid flow.

The Aliquippa hack promoted workers to temporarily halt pumping in a remote station that regulates water pressure for two nearby towns leading crews to switch to manual operation. The hackers left a digital calling card on the compromised device saying all Israeli-made equipment is “a legal target.”

The multiagency advisory said it was not known if the hackers had tried to penetrate deeper into breached networks. The access they did get enabled “more profound cyber physical effects on processes and equipment” it said.

The advisory says the hackers who call themselves “Cyber Av3ngers” are affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps which the U.S. designated as a foreign terrorist organization in 2019. The group targeted the Unitronics devices at least since Nov. 22 it said.

An online search Saturday with the Shodan service identified more than 200 such internet-connected devices in the U.S. and more than 1700 globally.

The advisory notes that Unitronics devices ship with a default password a practice experts discourage as it makes them more vulnerable to hacking. Best practices call for devices to require a unique password to be created out of the box. It says the hackers likely accessed affected devices by “exploiting cybersecurity weaknesses including poor password security and exposure to the internet.”

Experts say many water utilities have paid insufficient attention to cybersecurity.

In response to the Aliquippa hack three Pennsylvania congressmen asked the U.S. Justice Department in a letter to investigate. Americans must know their drinking water and other basic infrastructure is safe from “nation-state adversaries and terrorist organizations” U.S. Sens. John Fetterman and Bob Casey and U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio said. Cyber Av3ngers claimed in an Oct. 30 social media post to have hacked 10 water treatment stations in Israel though it is not clear if they shut down any equipment.

Since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war the group has expanded and accelerated targeting Israeli critical infrastructure said Check Point’s Sergey Shykevich. Iran and Israel were engaged in low-level cyberconflict prior to the Oct. 7. Unitronics has not responded to the AP queries about the hacks.

The attack came less than a month after a federal appeals court decision prompted the EPA to rescind a rule that would have obliged U.S public water systems to include cybersecurity testing in their regular federally mandated audits. The rollback was triggered by a federal appeals court decision in a case brought by Missouri Arkansas and Iowa and joined by a water utility trade group.

The Biden administration has been trying to shore up cybersecurity of critical infrastructure — more than 80% of which is privately owned — and has imposed regulations on sectors including electric utilities gas pipelines and nuclear facilities. But many experts complain that too many vital industries are permitted to self-regulate.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzI3LmNvbS9wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEvYXAtY29uZ3Jlc3NtZW4tYXNrLWRvai10by1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZS13YXRlci11dGlsaXR5LWhhY2std2FybmluZy1pdC1jb3VsZC1oYXBwZW4tYW55d2hlcmUv0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzI3LmNvbS9wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEvYXAtY29uZ3Jlc3NtZW4tYXNrLWRvai10by1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZS13YXRlci11dGlsaXR5LWhhY2std2FybmluZy1pdC1jb3VsZC1oYXBwZW4tYW55d2hlcmUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Congressmen ask DOJ to investigate water utility hack warning it could happen anywhere,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.abc27.com/pennsylvania/ap-congressmen-ask-doj-to-investigate-water-utility-hack-warning-it-could-happen-anywhere/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzI3LmNvbS9wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEvYXAtY29uZ3Jlc3NtZW4tYXNrLWRvai10by1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZS13YXRlci11dGlsaXR5LWhhY2std2FybmluZy1pdC1jb3VsZC1oYXBwZW4tYW55d2hlcmUv0gGBAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYzI3LmNvbS9wZW5uc3lsdmFuaWEvYXAtY29uZ3Jlc3NtZW4tYXNrLWRvai10by1pbnZlc3RpZ2F0ZS13YXRlci11dGlsaXR5LWhhY2std2FybmluZy1pdC1jb3VsZC1oYXBwZW4tYW55d2hlcmUvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vd2FtdS5vcmcvc3RvcnkvMjMvMTIvMDMvd2FpdGluZy1mb3Itd2F0ZXItaXRzLWV2ZXJ5d2hlcmUtaW4tdGhpcy1jb2xvbWJpYW4tY2l0eS1leGNlcHQtaW4tdGhlLXBpcGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Waiting for water: It's everywhere in this Colombian city — except in the pipes,"Privacy Overview

Here's Why,"A new study conducted by Ameriprise Financial shows that even when Americans have stashed sizable sums of money into their investment accounts they still might not see themselves as wealthy.

The financial group surveyed hundreds of Americans with $1 million or more in assets and found some surprising results including that 31% say they are ""middle class."" That may come as a shock to many Americans who have assets worth far less than that. Among the group of millionaires 60% say they are ""upper middle class"" and just 8% consider themselves ""wealthy.""

Why is there a difference in how the respondents defined their personal finances? It may be because everyone has a different perspective on what they think wealth is. The survey showed that most investors (85%) define wealth as financial security. Others thought wealth was being able to provide for themselves and their family while some said it was the ""freedom to do what I want.""

Definitions of the middle class vary

You might excuse the surveyed millionaires for not knowing whether they're middle class partly because there are many different ways to define it.

For example the Pew Research Center says someone is middle class if they have an annual household income that is two-thirds to double the national median income. The national median household income was $74580 in 2022 which means a middle-class household earns between $49720 and $149160 under this definition.

However the Brookings Institute says there are three separate definitions of the middle class and it doesn't even require a household to earn a specific income. Instead it says the term can refer to a person's professional credentials their culture or the amount of money they have.

How millionaires recommend building wealth

No matter how you define being middle class there are some practical lessons all of us can take from those who've accumulated substantial wealth. The Ameriprise survey respondents mentioned three top factors that helped them accumulate more than $1 million.

Financial planning and investing: 80% of respondents said this was the most important driver to building wealth. Thankfully you don't have to be an investing wiz to do well financially. Owning low-cost index funds in an investment account can help you build wealth over time.

But finding a few ways to boost your income can go a long way to helping you achieve your financial goals as well. Gig workers earn an average of $5700 annually and many of these jobs can be done in addition to your day job.

Living within your means: 69% said living within their means contributed to their financial success. The high cost of living has made this suggestion difficult for many Americans but it's a good reminder to keep tabs on your purchases. Debt payoff apps can be an excellent way to get your finances back on track if you need help.

You don't have to accumulate $1 million to be on the right financial track; for some people that might not be the best goal. Instead think of one financial goal you want to achieve. It could be stashing $1000 in your savings account putting money aside for buying a home or paying off your credit card balance. It all starts with setting a goal and creating a financial plan to get there.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vbmVicmFza2FleGFtaW5lci5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8wMi8yMDI0LWNhdWN1cy1wcmltYXJ5LWFuZC1nZW5lcmFsLWVsZWN0aW9ucy1jb250cm9sbGVkLWJ5LWV4dHJlbWlzdHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2024 caucus-primary and general elections controlled by extremists • Nebraska Examiner,"On Sept. 18 1787 the last day of the U.S. Constitutional Convention James McHenry a Maryland delegate asked Benjamin Franklin “well Doctor what have we got a republic or a monarchy?” Franklin’s reply “a republic if you can keep it” is profound. Not only does our democracy depend upon the supreme power of its residents and their elected representatives but for America to survive it depends upon its citizens to become actively involved in the selection of its elected delegates.

So what’s the problem? The Pew Research Center reports America’s voting turnout ranks an “underwhelming” 31st out of 50 countries that exhibit solid democratic traditions. While the 2020 presidential election had the highest voter turnout of the 21st century (66.7%) it’s sad that one out of every three people you meet on the street didn’t partake in our attempt to keep a republic.

In the past six general elections (2000-2020) the average turnout rate of registered voters for primary elections was 27% while the average turnout rate for general elections was slightly over 60%. This means more than half (55%) of general election voters did not vote in primary elections. For midterm primary elections it’s worse: about 80% of eligible voters do not partake in primary elections.

What’s the significance of this data? Low voter participation in caucus/primary elections means that a smaller subset of voters – most likely far left-wing crazies and far right-wing wackos – hoodwinked by candidate disinformation misinformation far-fetched promises propaganda and/or sinister political agendas may be playing an over-proportionate role in determining the final candidates.

A minority of the minority is selecting our political candidates

Let’s face it. We may be electing self-centered party-before-the-people politicians allegiant to their financial supporters simply because we’re not active – like Benjamin Franklin feared – in allelections. We have only ourselves to blame if we’re represented by less-than-desirable narcissistic divisive rude opponent-bashing retribution-oriented racist anti-bipartisan anti-trade anti-democracy anti-constitution and pro-authoritarian delegates.

Let’s review a couple of caucus/primary election examples:

Joe Biden ran for president three different times and didn’t win his first caucus/primary election until Feb. 28 2020 when he defeated Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in South Carolina. Biden was one of 22 candidates and has been a politician since 1971.

Donald Trump who has changed party affiliation five times was a presidential candidate in 2000 with the Reform Party. A 2020 study (Journal of Politics) revealed voters had the most difficulty assessing the ideology of Trump in the 2016 election out of all presidential candidates since 1972 and all contemporary legislators. Trump was one of 17 candidates seeking the GOP presidential nomination.

Was Mr. Biden and/or Mr. Trump the best candidate for his respective party or the winner only because a small subset of rabid fanatical Democrats or rabid extremist Republicans voted while the majority of D and R voters didn’t partake in the caucus/primary election?

Americans aren’t taking the caucus/primary and general election process seriously

What can you do to help America remain a democracy and select the best candidates? Be proactive. Go to www.270towin.com’s “2024 presidential election calendar” to find out the precise date of your caucus/primary election and vote. Next mark your calendar to also vote on Nov. 5 2024.

Officials within your political party of preference as well as your county and state auditor can assist with any voting inquiry.

The first of 15 caucus and 53 primary elections is scheduled for Jan. 15. Heed the words of Thomas Jefferson: “We do not have government by the majority. We have government by the majority who participate.”

Be in the majority by voting in the caucus/primary and general elections or don’t complain about the religious cultural and political zealot-elected politicians we must endure for another two to four years who purposely could be seeking office to change America from a republic to a monarchy.",,,,,,,,,

BOSTON — The workforce shortage that has left employers across sectors scrambling to keep operations running in recent years isn't likely to let up ""any time in the rest of anybody's lifetime"" one of the nation's leading economists said Thursday.

""We're going to have a persistent worker shortage for the foreseeable future"" Curtis Dubay chief economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said at a Greater Boston Business Chamber event at WBUR City Space.

Some employers have been waiting for more workers to become available he said but it's time to start shifting to a new strategy of accepting the wide gap between the number of jobs that businesses want to fill and the workers available to fill them.

The labor supply shortage is largely caused by the mass retirement of Baby Boomers Dubay said. ""Succeeding generations after the Baby Boomer generation just weren't big enough.""

There are currently about 3.5 million more job openings than workers available in the country.

No quick solution to Massachusetts labor shortage

Acknowledging that there is no quick solution to the workforce supply issue will be important for Boston businesses as they navigate the labor market Jim Rooney CEO of the Greater Boston Business Chamber said.

""Identifying the labor issues and the worker shortage problem was not unexpected I think what was eye-opening was what Curtis said about it being a longer-term problem"" Rooney said. ""In our minds it's a period of time to get through but given the trends that are driving it and how powerful they are it's going to be much longer term.""

About 10000 Baby Boomers turn 65 and are eligible for retirement every day according to the U.S. Census. By 2030 every member of this large generation will be over retirement age.

With fewer people to fill the roles that the older generation is stepping down from Dubay said the U.S. will need to rely more on immigrants as increasing birth rates is ""not something you can fix with public policy.""

Immigration reform needed to cure labor shortage

Rooney called Boston a ""city driven by immigrants"" and agreed with Dubay's calls for federal immigration reform.

""Our immigration policies are way behind we're not embracing — particularly in this region — what has sustained the economy of Boston really for 400 years"" Rooney said. ""About a third of the workforce in our hospitals are foreign-born. I'm not talking about cafeteria workers cleaners. I'm talking about medical professionals performing surgery in the operating room and treating patients.""

While employers have lamented difficulties running businesses without adequate staff Dubay said Tuesday that workers have benefited.

Economy continues to grow despite recession fears

The economy has continued to grow over the past few years despite economists' frequent predictions that a recession is around the corner.

""Consumers keep spending. That's what's driving growth — they continue to spend. They shouldn't be able to keep spending at such a rate. But the point is they can keep spending because if they want a job or if they want to spend and need a job they can have one"" Dubay said.

Wages are growing as employers try to retain workers which also encourages more spending.

With more opportunities and security for workers Dubay said that even as projections show a slowing economy in 2024 ""I don't think it really matters that much"" if there is a recession.

The U.S. experienced a recession in the first half of 2022 when there were two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth he said. The economist argued that ""no one remembers"" the dip.

""The reason no one remembers that is because during that period jobs expanded spending increased income grew and manufacturing output increased"" Dubay said. ""The point is did it really matter? If all those things that would affect people's daily lives if they're growing and increasing then did we have a recession if no one feels any pain? Does it really matter if it's a recession or not?""

Dubay called this a ""tree falls in the woods recession"" saying that even if the economy slows in 2024 there likely won't be mass layoffs as workers are too valuable to employers in the current landscape.

One of the panelists at Thursday's event Yasmine King of semiconductor manufacturer Analog Devices said her company's number-one challenge is the workforce shortage.

Massachusetts housing costs and living expenses key to retaining attracting workforce

The semiconductor industry is growing at an exponential rate in the U.S.

""We're estimating that by 2030 the industry will need another 115000 jobs in the U.S. and with our current graduation rates of advanced degrees and technical training programs we won't be able to fill half. So that's a significant problem and that's just semiconductors"" King said.

Higher education institutions have been experiencing and continue to prepare for decreased enrollment.

""That's going to be a particular challenge for all higher ed but with Boston being so concentrated it will be a particular challenge here"" Dubay said.

With a shrinking workforce that may not re-inflate any time soon Rooney said on Thursday that Boston and Massachusetts need to shift their strategy to attract the best talent to move to the area and retain those who already live here.

""It's a national issue that is going to have some duration which means that we're in competition for talent with other regions all over the country and they're competing with us"" Rooney said. ""This is a national competition for talent … we need to understand what levers we have to pull to make it attractive to young people to stay here. I think we know what the answer is where we need to lean into — it's housing prices and costs.""

What is the trilemma facing the energy industry?

As businesses organisations and governments all over the world put more and more effort into decarbonising the economy the energy industry faces a trilemma which can be broken down into three main pillars. Firstly it needs secure affordable and scalable energy to serve a growing population. Secondly that energy must be delivered converted and consumed more efficiently. And thirdly there is a need for new cleaner energy sources to support growth whilst replacing the widespread use of fossil fuels.

Do you think the current conversation around decarbonisation takes into account all three pillars of the trilemma?

The conversation surrounding decarbonisation can often be too narrow which risks neglecting the wider trilemma. Conversations can be dominated around potential solutions like ‘banning all fossil fuels’ which doesn’t take into account how complicated of an issue this is. If we are to succeed in providing robust reliable and affordable energy to everyone on the planet each pillar of the trilemma needs to be addressed.

For example if we look at the first issue there is the need to significantly increase the number of people who have access to electricity. Although an additional one billion people have been given access to electricity in the past few decades there are still around one billion people worldwide who do not have access to electricity. Additionally there is the issue of efficiency – currently around 65% of the energy that is sourced converted and consumed worldwide is wasted through inefficiencies.

So before we even look at the third pillar of the trilemma – developing a new cleaner energy source – there are significant things that can be done to improve the situation in the short term and increase the energy we currently supply through a big improvement in efficiency.

In this endeavour digital engineering is making great strides forward. The application of digital technologies to engineering design simulation optimisation and the operation of systems and processes across the whole life cycle of a product is making a significant contribution to energy efficiency and sustainability – and its contribution will only increase over time.

What can be done in the short term if we are to achieve our net-zero goals?

In the short term whilst we are in a transitional period where new technologies and energy sources are being discovered and developed improving energy efficiency in all products and processes is the best way to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. If efforts are focused on this area it could reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by up to 40% which would go a long way to helping us achieve our short-term net-zero ambitions. Currently 31% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions footprint comes from converting fossil fuels into electricity and heat; of that electricity a massive 45% is used in electrical motors in isolation. This means that currently 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions produced by humans come from electric motors. This is particularly significant as the global transportation sector is currently embarking on a vast electrification effort meaning that the use of electric motors is set to exponentially increase in the coming decades. As a result any efficiency that can be improved in electric motors could reduce global emissions by a few percent. Although that may sound small this would be a huge win for the planet as this solution is made up of many smaller percentage reductions in the aggregate.

How can digital engineering be employed in the design process to improve sustainability?

It is crucial to consider sustainability right from the off in the design process. This is because the majority of a product’s cost and environmental impact are locked in during the development and design cycle. One such decision that is critical to the overall impact that any product may have is that of materials selection. The materials that are used determine weight and therefore overall efficiency but also the recyclability. This is where the extensive use of digital engineering is pivotal. Firms are able to use digital engineering to input the exact properties of countless materials to be used in their simulations that are done at the beginning of the lifecycle. This means they get full insight into the most energy-efficient and cost-effective materials to use. Once the materials are chosen further simulations can be done to determine the optimal shape and makeup of a product again reducing material usage but critically without reducing strength. All of this works together to make a product that is more efficient in the first instance but also goes a long way to improving the overall life cycle of the product including having less material to recycle at the end of the lifecycle thus reducing energy consumption even further.

How can digital engineering be employed as the energy industry transitions to a more digital future?

On our path to a more sustainable future there are many new technologies that will be employed. The evolution of technologies such as the Internet of Things and 5G communications are driving the digital transformation of the industry as a whole and will play a crucial role moving forward. However the challenge comes with regards to energy assets and infrastructure that were commissioned long ago well before the explosion of the digital age. A big component of shifting the entire industry forward will be installing sensors actuators and communication devices so they can all be incorporated into the Internet of Things and this again is where the extensive use of digital engineering will be critical. It will allow a digital thread to be created that links all assets old and new into a single system that can be monitored by digital twins. Digital twins are a virtual replica of a real-world asset that allows engineers to understand how that asset will work in any given scenario. The use of digital twins allows teams to optimise efficiency reliability durability and real-time performance – all absolutely crucial to ensuring the long-term sustainability of any given product.

But what was missing from the acceptance of necessity (AoN) for big-ticket purchases like fighter jets and helicopters is the AoN for 114 Medium Multi-Role Fighter Aircraft (MRFA).

The IAF grappling with dwindling fighter squadrons and an aging fleet has been making a case for the MRFA seen as the Medium Multi-Role Combat Aircraft (MMRCA) deal re-incarnated. Despite the IAF pushing hard for it the Indian government emphasizing “Made in India” has not budged about purchasing 114 fighter jets from foreign manufacturers at an estimated US$20 billion.

Showing its commitment to the “Make in India” the IAF has agreed to 97 additional indigenous Light Combat Aircraft Mk1 from the Indian aerospace maker Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) the AoN for which was granted by the DAC-led by Defense Minister Rajnath Singh on November 30. The government’s nod has also come to purchase 156 home-built Light Combat Helicopters (LCH) ‘Prachanda.’

The IAF is already operating two squadrons of the Tejas Mk1 jets comprising 20 each of Initial and Final Operational Clearance variants. After approval from the Modi-headed Cabinet Committee on Security the US$6 billion order for 83 LCA Mk1A variants was placed with HAL in February 2021.

The first lot of the LCA Mk1A jets is slated for delivery to IAF in early 2024 following which these would be inducted into the functional squadron. The HAL has agreed to scale its production lines to deliver 24 LCAs annually.

The former Vice Chief of IAF Air Marshal Anil Khosla told the EurAsian Times that while the indigenous Tejas are good to make “there is a requirement for new-generation multi-role aircraft to maintain a balanced force (till the domestic Tejas Mk II and Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft is ready).”

“MRFA aircraft need to be procured (maybe in the next installment of defense spending). These should be procured in phases (maybe two to three squadrons at a time. This would spread the expenditure over some time and we would get later and better technology and features” Khosla added.

During his annual press conference IAF Chief Air Chief Marshal VR Chaudhari told the Indian media that the force plans to induct six squadrons of MRFA in a phased manner. The program would be progressed under the ‘Make in India’ initiative of DAP-2020. The IAF floated the Request for Information in 2018 and received responses from eight aircraft types. The leading contenders in the fray are Dassault’s Rafale Boeing’s F-15EX and Saab’s JAS-39 Gripen.

“ASQRs (Air Staff Qualitative Requirements) have been finalized and detailed interactions with OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) have taken place. OEM commitments for indigenous content of selected categories and ‘Make in India’ provisions are being sought. (It is) envisaged integrating indigenously developed A-A (air-to-air) and A-G (air-to-ground) weapons on MRFA being manufactured in India” the IAF chief added.

After the response from the aircraft makers the IAF has set fresh Air Staff Qualitative Requirements (ASQRs) and is awaiting a green signal from the government to send a proposal for an AoN. There has been little forward movement on the MRFA deal for over a year. In the meantime the IAF fighter squadron strength is down to 31 squadrons against the sanctioned strength of 42. It is looking to retire its Soviet-vintage MiG-21s by 2025 followed by MiG-29s and Jaguars.

LCA Mk-2 Versus MRFA

The IAF has underscored the urgent need for modern fighter platforms at every possible opportunity. And it can be safely said that once the AoN comes from the South Block which houses the Indian defense ministry it will take at least 6 to 8 years before the steel birds enter its fleet.

India will need a lot of aircraft to maintain combat parity with the People Liberation Army-Air Force (PLAAF) which remains the IAF’s primary adversary for years to come. However the IAF still needs to convince the incumbent Indian government that only imported aircraft in such large numbers can meet the need.

Air Marshal Khosla (retired) said that while the IAF’s capabilities have increased its “war endurance capacity the strength of fighter and combat support platforms” need attention. “Overall the deterrence capability has not kept pace with the existing threat perception. This aspect needs to be addressed urgently” he adds.

“While building up the capability and capacity the most important thing to remember is that the required minimum deterrence value is to be maintained at all times (either by domestic production or outside procurement). The lesson from all the recent wars is that self-reliance in defense production is essential” Air Marshal Khosla summed up.

An official told the EurAsian Times earlier. “F-21 F-15E Gripen-E Su-35 could all be contenders. The whole process up to aircraft delivery will take 6 to 7 years. By then Tejas Mk-2 may also be ready for induction. That may be the reason for the government’s indecision.”

The most significant task the IAF has is to convince the government to import fighter aircraft in the presence of LCA Mk-2 and Mk-1A.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi flew the indigenous LCA ‘Tejas’ in a strong signal of faith the government is reposing in the homegrown defense industry. Also taking a cue from ongoing global conflicts the government seems to have understood that the only way to achieve an international stature is to have a solid domestic military-industrial complex.

LCA Mk-2 will have enhanced range and endurance. The Mk-2 is 1350mm longer featuring canards and can carry a payload of 6500 kg compared to the 3500 kilograms that LCA can have. LCA Mk-2 will be powered by the General Electric F414-INS6 engine (earlier LCA variants used the F404).

The LCA Mk2 is expected to have a maximum speed of 1.8 Mach and a service ceiling of 50000 feet. Heavy weapons of the SCALP class Crystal Maze and Spice-2000 will also be integrated into the Mk-2. The IAF is expected to order over 200 LCA Mk-2 fighters.

The biggest question however remains if the ‘Mother of All Defense Deals” is dead or if the government is still taking time to ponder all its options.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAzL2lzLXdhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0cy1yZWNlbnQtc3RvY2stc2VsbGluZy1zZW5kaW5nLWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Warren Buffett's Recent Stock Selling Sending a Silent Warning to This Industry?,"Berkshire Hathaway sold several portfolio holdings in the third quarter including a significant amount from this one industry.

Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.48%) (BRK.B -0.55%) has been an excellent stock for longtime investors. Since Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett took Berkshire's reins in 1965 Buffett and his team have delivered phenomenal returns of 19.8% compounded annually. These returns have crushed the S&P 500 index which has delivered investors a solid 9.9% annual return in the same period.

The conglomerate's success is a big reason investors pay close attention to its 13F filing showing its buying and selling activity in a given quarter. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires this filing from institutional investors and it can provide us with some insights into what the best and brightest on Wall Street are doing.

In the third quarter Berkshire reduced its stake in several stocks many of which were long-term holdings. Included in the selling activity were several insurance stocks. Could this selling be a silent warning to the industry? Let's dig in and find out.

Berkshire Hathaway's selling included several insurance stocks

Buffett is a longtime fan of owning insurance companies and has previously said that insurance companies are ""a very large chunk of Berkshire's value."" Buffett credits his first insurance investment in National Indemnity in 1967 for helping turn around Berkshire Hathaway an ailing textile maker. Today the company owns several insurers including GEICO General Re Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance and Alleghany.

Given Buffett's affinity for insurance it was a little surprising to see Berkshire Hathaway dumping shares of several insurance companies during the past two quarters. In the second quarter Berkshire sold its position in Marsh & McLennan the insurance broker and workplace advisor it initially purchased in 2020.

Berkshire also sold 5.5 million shares of Globe Life or about 87% of its total position coming into the year. Globe Life the life insurer known as Torchmark until 2019 has been a part of Berkshire's portfolio since 2001. It also sold shares in Markel (312946 shares or 66% of its stake) and Aon (235000 shares or 5% of its stake) in the quarter.

Here's one reason Buffett and his team may have sold insurers

It's possible that Buffett and his team including Todd Combs and Ted Weschler don't see as much upside in insurance stocks. Like many industries the insurance business is cyclical. However it doesn't necessarily follow the typical business cycle. Instead insurers go through cycles depending on the claims costs and competition in the marketplace.

Insurers have dealt with rising claims costs for several years resulting in a ""hard"" insurance market. In this environment insurers must raise premiums to cover those rising claims costs. Additionally fewer insurers are competing for business allowing these companies to raise premiums without losing too much business. Claims costs have risen for several reasons including increasing climate-related disasters inflationary pressures and increased litigation against insurers.

According to Marsh & McLennan's Globe Insurance Market Index which measures global commercial insurance premium pricing change at renewal pricing increases for insurers have gradually come down since peaking amid the pandemic and could be signs of a softening insurance market.

Experts expect the pricing environment for insurers to continue softening. Reinsurance or insurance that insurers buy to protect themselves against catastrophic losses can be a good indicator of the overall pricing environment for insurance companies. Fitch Ratings expects reinsurance rates to continue rising in 2024 albeit slower than this year with prices falling in 2025.

Investors shouldn't be too concerned about Berkshire's selling

A slowdown in price increases is a welcome sign for individuals and businesses which have seen premiums rise significantly since the early days of the pandemic. For insurers it means they won't be able to grow quite as quickly and may have to compete among each other for business in a less favorable pricing environment. If insurers sell off from here it could be an intriguing opportunity for investors.

Kinsale Capital is one insurer that has performed well. While its valuation is a little higher if the stock were to sell off much from here it could be an excellent stock to buy the dip on. Progressive is another example of an outstanding insurance stock that has performed well for decades because of its long-term commitment to underwriting profitable policies. Finally Marsh & McLennan's business has performed well across multiple recessions since 1962.

For insurance stock investors I wouldn't be too concerned about Berkshire's selling activity. The conglomerate still holds several private insurance companies including GEICO and Alleghany. However Berkshire's selling is a good reminder to invest in high-quality insurers that can perform well across different cycles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZmRiLm9yZy9lbi9uZXdzLWFuZC1ldmVudHMvY29wLTI4LWFmcmljYW4tZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtYmFua3MtMS1iaWxsaW9uLWluc3VyYW5jZS1mYWNpbGl0eS1wcm90ZWN0LW1pbGxpb25zLWZhcm1lcnMtYWZyaWNhLTY2NTMx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,COP 28,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/cop-28-african-development-banks-1-billion-insurance-facility-protect-millions-farmers-africa-66531 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZmRiLm9yZy9lbi9uZXdzLWFuZC1ldmVudHMvY29wLTI4LWFmcmljYW4tZGV2ZWxvcG1lbnQtYmFua3MtMS1iaWxsaW9uLWluc3VyYW5jZS1mYWNpbGl0eS1wcm90ZWN0LW1pbGxpb25zLWZhcm1lcnMtYWZyaWNhLTY2NTMx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZmRiLm9yZy9lbi9uZXdzLWFuZC1ldmVudHMvZXZlbnRzL2FmcmljYS1jbGltYXRlLXJpc2staW5zdXJhbmNlLWZhY2lsaXR5LWFkYXB0YXRpb24tYWNyaWZhLWRlLXJpc2tpbmctaW52ZXN0bWVudHMtY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2UtYWRhcHRhdGlvbi10aHJvdWdoLWluc3VyYW5jZS02NjI4MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Africa Climate Risk Insurance Facility for Adaptation (ACRIFA) - De-risking investments in climate change ...,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/events/africa-climate-risk-insurance-facility-adaptation-acrifa-de-risking-investments-climate-change-adaptation-through-insurance-66282 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMisAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hZmRiLm9yZy9lbi9uZXdzLWFuZC1ldmVudHMvZXZlbnRzL2FmcmljYS1jbGltYXRlLXJpc2staW5zdXJhbmNlLWZhY2lsaXR5LWFkYXB0YXRpb24tYWNyaWZhLWRlLXJpc2tpbmctaW52ZXN0bWVudHMtY2xpbWF0ZS1jaGFuZ2UtYWRhcHRhdGlvbi10aHJvdWdoLWluc3VyYW5jZS02NjI4MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9jb21wYW55L2NvcnBvcmF0ZS10cmVuZHMvaW5kaWEtaW5jcy10YWtpbmctc3RlcHMtdG8tYnVpbGQtYS1mdXR1cmUtZm9yLXBlb3BsZS13aXRoLWRpc2FiaWxpdGllcy9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy8xMDU2ODQwNDYuY21z0gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2NvbXBhbnkvY29ycG9yYXRlLXRyZW5kcy9pbmRpYS1pbmNzLXRha2luZy1zdGVwcy10by1idWlsZC1hLWZ1dHVyZS1mb3ItcGVvcGxlLXdpdGgtZGlzYWJpbGl0aWVzL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy8xMDU2ODQwNDYuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India Inc taking steps to build a future for people with disabilities,"Empower Your Corporate Journey with Strategic Skill Courses Offering College Course Website Indian School of Business ISB Leadership in AI Visit Indian School of Business ISB Chief Digital Officer Visit University of Western Australia UWA Global MBA Visit

When Accenture India’s Anil Jain managing director strategy & consulting global network developed a hearing impairment a few months ago he knew his life was about to change. That was when the technology giant stepped in and the enablement created through a combination of policies allies and assistive technology empowered Jain to continue with his career despite the challenges of an acquired disability.As the world marks the International Day of Persons with Disabilities on December 3 companies including Accenture Amazon KFC ITC  L&T Mercedes Benz Research and Development India and Marico are adopting a 360-degree approach towards PwD inclusion.On one hand they’re working to overcome barriers and biases that set back employees with disabilities and provide them with leadership opportunities mentoring and future career pathways; on the other they’re accelerating hiring efforts as overall PwD representation in the workforce remains dismally low.Experts said that improving overall representation will take time but efforts are on.“There is a lot of ground yet to be covered but organisations are focusing hard on increasing representation and driving an equitable and inclusive culture for PwDs” said Leenika Khattar director of diversity inclusion and belonging – at IT industry body Nasscom. A June 2023 Aon-Nasscom study on the DEI landscape in India Inc showed that PwDs are part of the DE&I agenda in 83% of companies.At Larsen & Toubro among the current headcount of the PwD category of employees about 40% are in the managerial cadre leading teams and projects across various businesses.“Considering our industry it is challenging to hire people with disability at site locations; however we are exploring roles and locations that meet their needs. We have the leadership buy-in for our overall DEI efforts” said Dr C. Jayakumar head of Corporate Human Resource (CHRO) L&T. They are also trying to engage with NGOs who can help get the right talent.ITC has employed over 450 differently abled individuals across various roles and functions and the objective is to further scale this up going forward. Its Mangaldeep brand has set up the flagship ‘Sixth Sense’ panels in Delhi Kolkata Mumbai Hyderabad and Chennai to provide livelihood opportunities to visually challenged people by tapping into their keen olfactory abilities to improve its product offerings.Amazon has launched Aurora a programme designed to leverage the unique talents of individuals with learning disabilities and provide employment to them.Marico currently has members with disability across mid-to-senior levels in sales manufacturing and corporate functions. Earlier this fiscal it introduced 'WINGS' an initiative geared towards creating a consistent talent pipeline nurturing individuals with disabilities internally and preparing them for managerial roles within key business units across organisation said Amit Prakash CHRO Marico.With initiatives taken around training skilling and career support many PwD employees are working their way up to more senior roles.KFC India which has a team of 223 speech & hearing-impaired employees across the country has through training and support seen a large number of them progress to restaurant leadership roles such as shift manager and restaurant general manager.“We provide comprehensive support for their empowerment and growth encompassing a holistic 360-degree approach” said Aman Lal chief people officer KFC India.At Mercedes-Benz Research and Development India (MBRDI) employees with disabilities ranging from vision or hearing to locomotor impairments are actively contributing to various research and development integrated design solutions and IT projects across departments. The company is dedicated to supporting PwD employees through a multifaceted approach beginning with physical infrastructure and extending to career support.Sangeeta Iyer diagnosed with a 40% locomotor disability caused by polio when she was a child joined Accenture 16 years ago and has since grown to become managing director Advanced Technology Centres in India. “The culture of inclusion and initiatives like flexible working has created a safe space for me to thrive in” she said."

With a monster gain in 2023 that exceeds the Nasdaq Composite index Apple (AAPL 0.40%) is again showing that it's a favorite among the investment community. And this is much needed particularly after the stock lost an eye-watering 27% of its value in 2022. But now with Apple shares getting close to an all-time high again the question is this: Should investors buy sell or hold this leading consumer discretionary stock?

Facing a slowdown

Macro headwinds have been negatively impacting Apple in recent quarters. The company's revenue totaled $383 billion in fiscal 2023 which was down 2.8% year over year. This was the first annual sales decline since fiscal 2019. Yet investors seem to have shrugged off this news. The stock has climbed about 7% since the announcement.

In the latest quarter all product categories showed revenue drops except for the iPhone. But while it was encouraging that the company's flagship product registered growth with management even saying that iPhone 15 sales were doing better than iPhone 14 last year CFO Luca Maestri said Apple's overall revenue in the current quarter will be ""similar to last year.""

The forecast for a lack of top-line gains especially during the key holiday shopping season is a troubling sign. It just might indicate that Apple will continue to face pressures in the near term.

Economic moat

But there are reasons to have a positive attitude about this business. Apple possesses a wide economic moat that has supported its remarkable success over the years and should continue doing so in the future. In short it has a powerful brand. Its popular hardware products carry a premium status in the industry with the business exhibiting proven pricing power that hasn't deterred consumers from paying up.

That's why Apple products carry a stellar gross margin of 37% (for fiscal 2023). This is really impressive and bucks the reputation of consumer electronics being a terrible business that must always deal with falling prices.

Additionally Apple is bolstered by what I would call ""invisible"" switching costs. Of course there's nothing stopping any Apple customer from buying what a rival company offers. However Apple's ecosystem which consists of not only its hardware products but also various software and services helps to keep consumers locked in.

And with many of your friends and family likely using Apple products and services as well there's almost no incentive to leave.

What should investors do?

Apple's stock has soared this year and as a result it's not cheap. The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31 is about 50% more expensive than the trailing-10-year average of nearly 21. For a mature business that depends on a product like the iPhone that is almost saturated in its most important markets I view the chance for market-beating returns going forward as slim. This is why I don't recommend investors buy shares today.

On the flip side the case to sell the stock may make sense. If you've been a longtime Apple shareholder and you're sitting on fantastic gains then it could be a smart idea to take at least some of the profits off the table -- especially if there are other attractive investment opportunities you are eyeing right now.



Readers might also just want to follow what Warren Buffett is doing. The conglomerate he runs Berkshire Hathaway owns 5.9% of Apple's outstanding shares representing more than 48% of the company's equity portfolio. Berkshire remains an Apple owner. Maybe this is because of the dividends the tech giant pays or that its share buybacks continue to increase Berkshire's ownership position.

Dennis Ng Kwok-on vice-president of the Chinese Manufacturers’ Association of Hong Kong told the Post that the United States had started to ask local exporters who recently moved operations to Vietnam to register their companies in Singapore and designate a representative from the city state.

But a shippers’ organisation said moves to diversify away from the country would not be easy as it was an integral part of the global supply chain and difficult to replace. Amid the disruption manufacturers and brands both locally and abroad said they had to face new business realities some of which required overhauling operations.

A push by the US to drastically reduce its reliance on mainland China has forced Hong Kong exporters to sever some ties at home and over the border with firms also cutting down on imports of raw materials due to threats of boycotts industry leaders have told the Post.

“If these new entrants register their firms on the mainland or in Hong Kong they will not get any orders from the US and will be totally boycotted.”

Foreign investment has poured into Vietnam in recent years.

After enduring three years of strict Covid-19 restrictions mainland and Hong Kong companies have been among those setting up operations in the southeast Asian country including Growatt a Shenzhen-based power storage firm and Hangzhou First Applied Material a solar panel component maker.

But US buyers had reduced orders by 60 per cent in Vietnam in the face of economic belt-tightening high inflation and high interest rates in the country Ng said.

The pullback comes as Hong Kong’s exports suffered 17 consecutive months of decline up to September with an 11 per cent contraction recorded during the first 10 months of the year compared with the same period in 2022.

The gloomy streak was finally broken in October when exports grew by 1.4 per cent compared with the same month last year. Before that exports last recorded year-on-year growth in April 2022.

But authorities have warned that challenges will persist amid heightened geopolitical tensions.

The export figures cast a shadow over Hong Kong’s gross domestic product which the government estimated would grow by 3.2 per cent this year compared with 2022 missing its earlier forecast of 4 to 5 per cent.

Willy Lin Sun-mo chairman of Hong Kong Shippers’ Council said Washington’s tougher stance on decoupling started a few years ago when city exporters were told to cut down on made-in-China components or raw materials in their products.

“The US has demanded the city’s exporters to reduce made-in-China components to below 40 per cent by 2026-27 if they want to receive orders” Lin said.

“But a lot of companies have said it is difficult to source raw materials outside the country as processing of raw materials such as integrated circuit chips and yarn causes serious pollution such as water pollution” he said. “Many Asian countries don’t take part in this kind of production.”

Lin said he believed US buyers would eventually back down as there were no viable alternatives.

“China is irreplaceable in terms of producing raw materials with a very stable supply chain” he said. “Eventually the buyers will be forced to explain to their country that they will have to make concessions.”

Referring to requests for Hong Kong operators in Vietnam to register their companies in Singapore he said the impact was very limited.

“Its decoupling impact is not critical at all” Lin said. “If an operation is backed by Hong Kong investors the profits will eventually go into their pocket no matter where they register their companies.”

Steve Lamar president and CEO of the Washington-based American Apparel and Footwear Association that represents more than 1000 global brands said US companies were carrying out the largest sourcing diversification process in a generation to prevent being dragged into the geopolitical tensions.

“Although there is no single target number US apparel footwear and travel goods companies continue to diversify their sourcing [away] from China and other traditional suppliers to de-risk and build resilient supply chains” he told the Post.

“As part of that strategy [the association] has been advocating for more predictable and smart trade policies and programmes to support investment in and sourcing from Central America and the Caribbean Africa and the United States.”

But Lamar emphasised that as China would remain an important partner and market US firms should ensure they followed responsible purchasing and production practices in the country.

“It is also important to stress that with China continuing to be a large producer and consumer of fashion it will be at the forefront of any successful efforts to ensure that the industry meets science-based decarbonisation goals to combat climate change” he said.

But Louis Chan Wing-kin deputy director of research at the Trade Development Council described the shake-up as “labour pains” for exporters forced to reconstruct their supply chains.

“There’s no cause for concern” he said. “I would not call it decoupling from China but just some kind of strategic reshuffling of the global supply chain.”

Chan pointed out that firms could enter the US market under the North American Free Trade Agreement by establishing a presence in Mexico.

“There are many flexible ways to conduct business and resolve the issue of geopolitical tensions” he said.

“For example some firms have moved part of the production processes to Asean countries or set up shop in Mexico to break into the international market.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vZWNvbm9teS9uZXdzL2thcm5hdGFrYS1leWVzLXJzLTEtNC10cmlsbGlvbi1pbnZlc3RtZW50LWFubnVhbGx5LXRvLWJvb3N0LXN0YXRlLWVjb25vbXktMTIzMTIwMjAwNjc3XzEuaHRtbNIBkAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzcy1zdGFuZGFyZC5jb20vYW1wL2Vjb25vbXkvbmV3cy9rYXJuYXRha2EtZXllcy1ycy0xLTQtdHJpbGxpb24taW52ZXN0bWVudC1hbm51YWxseS10by1ib29zdC1zdGF0ZS1lY29ub215LTEyMzEyMDIwMDY3N18xLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Karnataka eyes Rs 1.4 trillion investment annually to boost state economy,"The Karnataka government has announced the initiation of several strategic initiatives aimed at attracting investments worth Rs 1.40 trillion annually a 75 per cent increase from the current level. The plan is to bring a total investment of Rs 7 trillion over next five years with an aim of establishing Karnataka as a premier investment destination in Asia for future technology and advanced manufacturing.

""Our government has initiated several measures to make Karnataka an industry-friendly state” stated M B Patil Minister for Large and Medium Industries and Infrastructure Development Government of Karnataka.

“We aim to create a conducive environment for all sectors to flourish” he added

Over the next five years the government plans to grow at a rate of 15-16 per cent annually and increase the industrial sector's contribution to the Gross State Value Added (GSVA). Currently the state attracts investments of about Rs 80000 crore per year.

The government's focus sectors include aerospace and defence electronic components core manufacturing warehousing and logistics. Additional sectors of interest are electric vehicles textiles semiconductors space tech and med tech.

Significant investment proposals received by the state government are from companies such as Foxconn IBC AMD Qualcomm Applied Materials Marubeni and Tata Technologies.

“We have a robust pipeline of investments worth Rs 50000 crore” Patil remarked.

The Government of Karnataka is preparing to announce a new industrial policy soon aiming to make the state the most preferred investment destination in the country.

“Measures like reconstituting the IKF Board forming a strategic investment committee and establishing nine sector-specific vision groups will position Karnataka as a leading state for investors” Patil added.

The strategic investment committee is tasked with guiding the industries department in attracting investments to the state. Nine Vision Groups have been established in various sectors including aerospace and defence ESDM auto and EV machine tools pharma core manufacturing industry 5.0 textiles and green energy.

To draw investors to its focus sectors the government is establishing ready-built factories industrial parks and clusters and common facilitation centres. It has also digitised the application and approval process providing real-time visibility of the Karnataka Industrial Areas Development Board (KIADB) land banks. Furthermore the government is fostering industry-academia collaboration and upgrading its polytechnics with modern equipment and infrastructure.

The government has undertaken several initiatives to maintain industrial growth including a recent delegation visit from the Department of Industries to the United States. The delegation engaged with US-based companies in technology semiconductor electric vehicles aerospace and healthcare highlighting investment opportunities in Karnataka.

The Strategic Investment Committee under the Invest Karnataka Forum (IKF) is a notable development. IKF in its revamped form will benefit from the participation of leaders across various industrial sectors including core manufacturing.

The government emphasised Karnataka's investor-friendly policies which include multiple financial incentives to enhance cost economics and a readily available industrial ecosystem including land. The state boasts a highly skilled and trained workforce robust skill infrastructure and subsidies.",,,,,,

Training and running advanced artificial intelligence (AI) models requires more than just powerful graphics processing units (GPUs). Those GPUs do the heavy lifting but feeding the ultra-powerful chips with data can become a bottleneck. A cluster of servers with tens of thousands of GPUs linked together requires some heavy-duty networking gear to make it all work.

Cisco Systems (CSCO -0.41%) is the longtime leader in the switching and routing markets with its proprietary products maintaining dominant market shares. Across the entire enterprise network infrastructure market the company managed a 41% share in 2022 quadrupling that of its nearest competitor.

Cisco's model of bundling its proprietary hardware and software isn't appealing to everyone. A more flexible approach makes sense for the major cloud providers which build data centers at incredible scale and have very specific networking needs.

Cisco competitor Arista Networks which builds its networking gear using merchant silicon from third parties and layers a fully programmable operating system on top has had great success in winning business from some of the cloud giants.

Going after the AI market

Given that the major cloud providers are scooping up the bulk of powerful GPUs to build out their AI capacity Cisco would be missing out on a huge market without a change in strategy. The company hasn't had much of a presence among the major cloud providers in recent years but its Silicon One family of networking chips is changing the picture.

""We regained our footing there because we listened and we showed flexibility with our willingness to disaggregate if they wanted to do so"" said Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins during the latest earnings call speaking of the major cloud providers. ""So I think that the disaggregation and the flexibility and us listening to them and understanding what they wanted was the reason that we got back in"" Robbins continued.

Cisco's Silicon One chips can power ultra-fast switches and routers allowing cloud providers to build the networking architecture they need in their massive data centers. The chips are fully programmable and support massive data throughput making them ideal for AI networks.

Cisco is having some early success with its AI-focused products and expects significant revenue down the road. The company's Ethernet AI fabric is deployed at three major hyperscale companies and it expects to receive more than $1 billion in orders for AI infrastructure from major cloud providers in fiscal 2025. So far the company has booked about $500 million in orders. By 2027 the market for AI switching is expected to top $10 billion.

Cisco will be going up against Arista which is growing rapidly thanks in part to a heavy dependence on Microsoft and Meta Platforms. Cisco's market share doesn't yield any advantages in winning business from major cloud providers so its products must stand on their own. So far the company appears to be gaining meaningful traction.

Is Cisco stock a buy?

Cisco generates more than $50 billion in revenue annually so AI-related revenue will be a minor contribution for the foreseeable future. Even if demand for Cisco's AI products grows rapidly the company's overall results are still heavily tied to the state of the economy. During times of economic uncertainty Cisco's customers can pull back on tech spending and delay orders.

Cisco stock looks reasonably priced trading for about 12 times the company's guidance for fiscal 2024 adjusted earnings. However the company is facing some headwinds as customers work through products delivered as Cisco was bringing its backlog down to normal levels. Cisco expects one or two quarters of lower revenue before growth rebounds to more normal levels.

There's a risk that this slowdown will become more drawn out as customers pull back in an uncertain economic environment which would put pressure on Cisco's profits. Still a reasonable valuation coupled with a long-term opportunity to tap into the AI infrastructure market makes Cisco stock an interesting proposition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAzL3doeS10aGlzLXVuZGVyYXBwcmVjaWF0ZWQtdmFuZ3VhcmQtZnVuZC1jb3VsZC1iZS13L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why This Underappreciated Vanguard Fund Could Be Worth Buying Right Now,"The Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF is a unique investment worth exploring.

Vanguard is a titan in the investment world. Its index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are easy and inexpensive ways to achieve diversification.

If you're familiar with Vanguard the first product that comes to mind is probably something like an S&P 500 index fund its popular growth ETF or its value ETF.

One of the lesser-known but still massive funds is the Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF (VO 0.37%) with $132.6 billion in net assets. Here's why the fund is unique and worth buying now.

Not your typical fund

The Vanguard Mid-Cap Fund holds 338 companies and sports a 0.04% expense ratio which is similar to the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF's (VOO 0.18%) 507 holdings and 0.03% expense ratio. However the big differences between the Mid-Cap ETF and other top Vanguard funds are the weightings by sector and the weightings by individual stock.

The distinction is apparent if we simply look at the weights of the top 10 holdings. In the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF the top 10 holdings which include stocks like Apple and Microsoft make up 32.2% of the fund. The Vanguard Growth ETF is even more concentrated with 56.2% invested in just 10 holdings. And even the Vanguard Value ETF has 23.2% invested in the top 10 stocks.

Flip over to the Mid-Cap Fund and you'll find the largest holding makes up less than 1% of the fund while the top 10 holdings make up just 7.6% of the fund.

Sector breakdown

The weightings by sector between the Mid-Cap ETF and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF are very different as well.

Sector Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF Vanguard S&P 500 ETF Industrials 18.0% 8.3% Technology/Communications 15.7% 36.8% Consumer Discretionary 13.0% 10.6% Financials 12.8% 12.7% Health Care 9.7% 13.2% Real Estate 8.4% 2.4% Utilities 7.9% 2.5% Energy 5.6% 4.5% Consumer Staples 4.9% 6.6% Basic Materials 4.0% 2.4%

As you can see in the table the Mid-Cap Fund sports more than double the industrials allocation more than triple the weighting in real estate and utilities and less than half the weight in technology/communications.

The reason is the fund doesn't reflect the most valuable companies in the same way the S&P 500 does. And it's not going to assign the largest weights to the most important value stocks or growth stocks like other ETFs would do.

Instead the Mid-Cap Fund focuses on smaller but still sizable companies blending value and growth and avoiding ultra-large businesses.

The largest financials holding isn't JPMorgan Chase or Berkshire Hathaway -- its Arthur J. Gallagher. The largest technology holdings aren't Apple and Microsoft they're Amphenol and Arista Networks. The list goes on and on.

It sounds strange on the surface but the dynamic plays out very well in practice. A good example is looking at the energy holdings.

The mid-cap fund has a 5.6% weighting in energy which is similar to the S&P 500 ETF's 4.5% weighting. But while around 2% of the S&P 500 is invested in ExxonMobil and Chevron 2% of the Mid-Cap Fund is invested in Hess Cheniere and Baker Hughes. It's the same idea -- just using a different approach that often leads to higher risk and higher potential reward.

The sector weightings can lead to a far different performance for the Mid-Cap ETF compared to the S&P 500. For example the Mid-Cap ETF is underperforming the broad market by quite a bit this year because the mega-cap tech stocks have contributed the bulk of the S&P 500's gains.

Not a foundational holding

Index funds and ETFs provide low-cost diversification and can do a great job of rounding out a portfolio. The Mid-Cap ETF -- with its specific holdings and sector weightings -- should be viewed as a tool to get exposure to companies you may normally overlook instead of as a foundational holding to build your portfolio around.

For example if you already own plenty of Apple stock then buying an S&P 500 index fund will noticeably add to your Apple exposure which you may not be looking to do. Put another way you may end up double-dipping with the biggest companies instead of achieving true diversification.

With the Mid-Cap ETF you're getting a small piece of many different companies you're less likely to already be invested in. In this sense the ETF is serving a specific role in a portfolio not just doing more of the same thing.

During the studio’s inaugural upfronts presentation the sequel plans were unveiled following the first film earning nearly 80 million worldwide viewers after debuting March 21 on Prime Video. Gyllenhaal will reprise his role as ex-UFC fighter Dalton.

“I am so ready like I love this character I love this world I love the thing that we’ve created and I can’t wait to bring more” the Gyllenhaal told the upfonts presentation. Other plot details for the Road House sequel are being kept under wraps.

Amazon said the remake of the 1989 action classic which starred Patrick Swayze was its biggest global movie launch ever. And for the first time for a feature film Amazon reported 50 million viewers had watched the film in its opening two weekends.

That made the project Amazon MGM Studios’ most-watched produced film debut ever on a worldwide basis. Road House made headlines ahead of its debut when director Doug Liman said he would skip its South by Southwest premiere in protest of the film not going to theaters.

On Monday the company backtracked and apologized for billboards that bore the message “You know full well a vow of celibacy is not the answer” juxtaposed against an introduction to “the new Bumble.” The app launched a brand redesign in April in hopes of reviving user interest which had been lagging.

Women on social media castigated the company for suggesting celibacy isn’t a valid personal choice. Some online critics read the slogan as reflecting patriarchal notions that women should be willing to have sex with men even if they don’t want to.

In an apology posted on Instagram Bumble said it is removing ads that it called a mistaken attempt to “lean into a community frustrated by modern dating.” It said the company has long stood up for women and their right to “fully exercise personal choice” but admitted that the ad campaign didn’t live up to those values and apologized “for the harm it caused.”

The company also plans donations to the National Domestic Violence Hotline and other organizations to support global efforts to “support women marginalized communities and those impacted by abuse.” The company said it will also offer the billboard space to these same organizations for ads of their choice.

Bumble did not respond to inquiries seeking information on how many billboards were involved in the campaign and where they were located. It remains unclear whether the ads also ran in other media.

The dating app company has been going through a rough patch. Its shares have fallen steadily since last July dropping roughly 45% over that time amid concerns over its ability to reach younger users. In February it laid off 350 employees roughly 30% of its workforce in February when it announced plans to revamp its app in order to make it more attractive to Generation Z.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vZXVyb3BlL2xpdmUtbmV3cy9ydXNzaWEtdWtyYWluZS13YXItbmV3cy0wNS0xNC0yNC9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFUaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vZXVyb3BlL2xpdmUtbmV3cy9ydXNzaWEtdWtyYWluZS13YXItbmV3cy0wNS0xNC0yNC9pbmRleC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Blinken in Kyiv at crucial point in Ukraine-Russia war: Live updates,"Georgian demonstrators attempt to break into the parliament through a metal barrier erected in front of its main gates during a rally against the controversial ""foreign influence"" bill in Tbilisi Georgia on Tuesday May 14.

Georgia’s parliament has passed a controversial “foreign agents” bill despite widespread domestic opposition and warnings from the European Union that its enactment would imperil the country’s chances of joining the bloc.

The new law will require organizations receiving more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as “agents of foreign influence” or face crippling fines. Opponents say that the legislation was modeled after similar laws in Russia that the Kremlin has used to increasingly snuff out opposition and civil society.

Dr. Dorothy Jean Tillman II was only 10 when she became a freshman at the college of Lake County majoring in psychology. In 2020 she earned her Master of Science from Unity College. She was accepted in 2021 when she was 15 into the Doctor of Behavioral Health Management Program at Arizona State University.

Speaking to ""Good Morning America"" Tillman said she has always held education in such high regard in part due to her family's background.

""People in my life like my grandmother who was part of the Civil Rights Movement she of course harped on the importance of education and consistently learning something always"" Tillman said.

""But the way I always held education so high on my own aside from being raised that way was finding different things to be educated about it doesn't just have to be all of the subjects that they teach you in school there's so many things in the world to learn about that we wish we knew about"" she said. ""I feel like that urge to learn something new just never didn't exist for me.""

Tillman said growing up she had always felt drawn toward psychology and related fields.

""They've always made me so curious"" she said. ""And so grinding away I could continue to study in that area. With even more that was attached to it. It was just really intriguing to me.""

In December 2023 at 17 Tillman successfully defended her dissertation to earn her doctoral degree in integrated behavioral health from ASU's College of Health Solutions. On May 6 she walked at ASU's commencement ceremonies.

Tillman told ""GMA"" prior to the big day that she was feeling ""so excited"" just like any other student.

""I love having a reason to celebrate and throw a big soirée"" she said. ""Just that walk and especially with people I haven't been there seeing every day since my program is online it's just gonna feel really fulfilling to finish.""

Dr. Leslie Manson a clinical associate professor at ASU told ""GMA"" that Tillman is the youngest person in school history to earn a doctoral degree in integrated behavioral health.

""It's a wonderful celebration and we hope ... that Dorothy Jean inspires more students"" Manson said adding of Tillman ""But this is still something so rare and unique.""

Throughout Tillman's time at ASU Mason said she saw her growth in gaining the skills of professional writing as well as leadership noting that Tillman is ""inquisitive"" and ""intelligent.""

""She has innovative ideas and motivation which is wonderful"" Mason explained. ""And truly I think what is inspiring is that she embodies that meaning of being a true leader.""

Mason added that ""other students can really learn the piece of dedication"" from Tillman.

""So that motivating energy those are the pieces that I think other folks can really turn to and feel inspired about"" she said. ""That curiosity is always there. And I think all learners come with that. But it's great to be able to see it in someone so young as well.""

Her inspiration and how she gives back to community

Tillman's journey to success wouldn't be made possible without the support from her mom whom she said is one of her biggest motivators.

""Seeing my mother consistently worked so hard to continuously uphold our family's legacy and be that person that everyone was able to go to if they needed anything... Always seeing [her] like [a] 'Wonder Woman' definitely made me want to grow up [into] an accomplished person"" she said.

An advocate for education Tillman is also the founder and CEO of the Dorothyjeanius STEAM Leadership Institute where she runs programs like summer camps to help kids find balance between arts and STEM subjects.

""I feel like adding art and putting a focus on it throughout science technology engineering and math makes the kids excited to learn all those things"" she said. ""And it opens them up to all of the possibilities and all the knowledge provided in that area of just STEM.""

As for her plans after graduation Tillman said she is ""just like any other teenager still figuring out what my specific dreams and goals are.""

""And I'm really just grateful that the world is my oyster and that I've done so much so young. And I have time to like kind of think that through"" she said.

Discussing her advice to other youngsters Tillman said she would remind them to be careful about being influenced on what they see on social media noting that some posts ""aren't real.""

""There's a lot more to whatever it is than what you're seeing you know and so to always remember that is definitely important"" she said. ""And to always remember that everyone has points in their life where they feel like they're figuring it out…And so figuring things out not knowing what you want isn't a bad thing.

Neal Sherman the chief executive of TAGeX Brands said on LinkedIn on Monday that it was assisting with the rapid closure of Red Lobsters in 21 US states starting today.

All of the equipment from the restaurants is now being sold off.

""TAGeX Brands is proud to launch the largest restaurant liquidation EVER through its online auction marketplace"" said Mr Sherman. ""The furniture fixtures and equipment from select Red Lobster locations MUST GO ASAP!""

The closures included five branches in California and Florida four in Colorado and Maryland three in Georgia New York Texas and Virginia and many others across the country.

It comes after reports that the Florida-based seafood chain is considering filing for bankruptcy after years of cost-cutting by its parent company.

In 2023 the struggling company was further knocked off balance by a $20 endless shrimp offer that proved unexpectedly popular with customers reportedly costing it millions of dollars.

The all-you-can-eat menu option was previously a time-limited promotional offer. But when Red Lobster made it permanent patrons ended up eating far more shrimp than the restaurant could afford while taking up tables and lengthening wait times for new arrivals.

""We were expecting an increase of 20 per cent in customer traffic but the actual number was up to 40 per cent"" said Thiraphong Chansiri the chief executive of Red Lobster's parent company Thai Union last November.

In January Thai Union announced it would end its involvement with Red Lobster after eating a $530m loss on its initial investment which it blamed on the Covid-19 pandemic and the rise of interest rates around the world.

Red Lobster did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

It is helpful for sharing 3D models and animation details between different software. Moreover it stores data like lighting textures geometry joints and animation and it’s suitable for animation applications and in virtual and augmented realities.

FBX files are mostly used in animation and gaming engines like UE4 and Unity. OBJ files on the other hand store basic 3D model data like geometry faces color and textures but they don't support animation lighting and rigging data like FBX. Most CAD programs support it and it is a file format mostly used in 3D printing like STL files. So if you have one of the best 3D printers  especially the ones that support multi-color 3D printing and you have an FBX file you can convert it to OBJ to 3D print. In addition to 3D printing purposes you can also convert FBX to OBJ if you just want a small file with simple geometries and you want to work with the meshes. This simplicity makes OBJ files smaller than FBX files. Below are the main tools to use to convert FBX files to OBJ.

1. Autodesk FBX Converter

By Stuart Butler

Fish in a hundred vibrant shades flit between monumental towers of coral and the waving jelly arms of sea anemones. The colours and diversity of life on a tropical coral reef can be dazzling. Such a habitat with its base of solid rock-like coral can appear almost indestructible. But sadly that is just an illusion and coral is in dire straits.

As many people know although it often looks like colourful rock coral is a community of invertebrates known as polyps. These soft-bodied creatures form hard exoskeletons by extracting calcium carbonate from the sea which over time grow to become coral reefs.

These corals are highly sensitive to changes in their environment and in recent years many of the world’s coral reefs have been impacted by coral bleaching. As oceans warm the coral becomes stressed which leads them to expel the symbiotic nutrient–providing algae that live within them and give the coral its colour. The polyps revert to their transparent state causing them to appear white as if they have been ‘bleached’ which – if the waters remain warm and they are unable to take on more algae will cause them to eventually die.

In the period between 2009 and 2020 there was a 14 per cent worldwide decline in coral which was largely caused by sustained coral bleaching. And the situation is expected to get worse with scientists estimating that a 1.5C increase in water temperatures would see 70-90 per cent of the world’s coral reefs destroyed. In fact some scientists estimate that by 2070 there is a very real danger that there will be no healthy coral reefs left anywhere.

Restoring coral reefs with the help of AI and robots. Video by Coral Maker and Autodesk.

Coral reef restoration programs have been in existence for some time but these tend to be a labour-intensive and very slow process that cannot hope to restore all the world’s reefs. Now though AI technology could be coming to the rescue. In the Abrolhos Islands 60km (40 miles) off the coast of Western Australia an innovative new project is underway to restore coral reefs using a mixture of robots and AI technology. Small bits of coral are grafted into special limestone bases which are then planted on the sea floor.

This technique speeds up the process of rejuvenating coral reefs but planting the required amount of coral cuttings by hand is very repetitive and time-consuming so robot arms are being trained through AI to do the task instead of people. At the moment the technology is still in the development phase but initial lab results are encouraging and it’s hoped that once the robot arms hit the sea they will greatly speed up the process of reef restoration.

As well as robot coral gardeners technology is also being used to protect and enhance coral growth in other ways. Clouds act as a kind of natural parasol and the more – and brighter – cloud there is the cooler the ocean below. Scientists are experimenting with the idea of injecting sea salt into ocean clouds. If the technique works then scientists believe that the injected clouds can be brightened by up to 5 per cent which would help keep the planet – and the coral reefs – cooler.

Another perhaps even more bizarre technology-driven solution to coral destruction is through singing like a fish. We can’t really hear it but coral reefs are noisy places and by training computer algorithms to analyse underwater sounds scientists are hoping to understand the noises that indicate a healthy coral reef ecosystem. And once they have that information the idea is to erect loudspeakers on the sea bed which would be used to attract fish and other coral animals back to the reef system by playing recordings of the sound of a healthy coral ecosystem.

All of this technology is very much in its infancy but if all goes according to plan there’s the chance that in the future Nemo will have plenty of healthy coral reef to play on.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFmci5jb20vdGVjaG5vbG9neS9hbHRpdW0tcy1ib2FyZC1zaHVmZmxlLXJhaXNlcy1leWVicm93cy0yMDIzMTEzMC1wNWVvNHbSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ALU ASX: Altium's board shuffle raises eyebrows,"When The Seekers’ “We are Australian” burst from the speakers at the Altium annual general meeting last week it took a moment for investors and management to catch the lyrical trick.

In the following we introduce the neural-network-based vortex detector motivated by U-Net which is designed for image segmentation to solve our private problems41424344. The overall task of image segmentation involves dividing an image into multiple segments or regions where each segment represents a distinct object or area of interest45. Here we are only interested in detecting vortices and the sizes of vortices across the simulated images do not vary significantly hence we focus on predicting the exact position of each vortex core rather than the full vortex region. Therefore our problem reduces to that of binary classification for each pixel denoting the vortices cores by 1 and the other regions by 0. We used 456 images as the data set and manually labeled the vortices cores of them 150 of which were used as the test data to calculate the metrics of the model and the rest as the training data.

In the process of machine learning manual labeling data points consumes a significant amount of human labor and time4647. Additionally for this specific problem the labeling process of denoting the vortices cores by 1 is very prone to errors due to human error. In the process of labeling it is easy to deviate from the exact center position by labeling the neighboring pixels and difficult to check. As shown in Fig. 1 the white circles are the artificially labeled vortices cores’ points some of which we have zoomed in to show clearly. We zoom in red rectangular marked area (b) of (a) and red rectangular marked area (d) of (c). It can be found that the ideal center point is the pixel with the darkest color but is actually labeled as the pixel near to it. This is a very common problem during the labeling process and can affect the training and output of the model especially it makes the metrics unreliable. Meanwhile there will also be some vortex cores missing labeling.

Although the labeled data is not entirely correct we use them directly for model training and propose a new ACL method to solve the problem. The vortex detector model takes as its input gray scale images \(I \in [01]^{W\times H \times C} \)with equal width and height \(W = H = 128\) and a number of channels \(C = 1\) to the U-Net neural network (see Fig. 2). In principle the output of the detector can map a probability to each image pixel corresponding to whether this pixel represents a vortex core or not. The output Y of the neural network is therefore a tensor of dimensions \(128 \times 128 \times 1\) where every number corresponds to the probability of a vortex core being attended by this pixel by applying Softmax function.

Figure 2 The network takes as its input images of dimension \(128 \times 128\) with the condensate density (a) and outputs the probability of a vortex core in every pixel position (b).

The x–y-size is offered to the lower left edge of the box. White boxes represent copied feature maps. The arrows denote the different operations. Full size image

Training model by the rough manually labeled data

Firstly we train the model directly on density images obtained from simulations with the GPE i.e. without the addition of any noise. Our training and testing data were acquired by manual labeling which has not always been accurate in itself as denoted in Fig. 1. The architecture of the model and the chosen hyper parameters are given in Fig. 2. The obtained density profiles are normalized such that their pixels lie between [0 1] before being input to the neural network. We use the ADAM optimizer48 and a loss function of binary cross entropy with logits loss49. We have determined that giving a higher weight to learning positive predictions stabilizes training and accelerates convergence50 stabilizes training and accelerates convergence50.

Figure 3ab show the same density image where white circles in (a) correspond to the manual labeling and red dots in (b) to the prediction of the trained model. For the output probability tensor the threshold is set to 0.5 in the experiment where greater than 0.5 is 1 (detected as a vortex core center) and less than 0.5 is 0 (detected as not a vortex core center) as shown in Fig. 3. Overall we achieved an accuracy value of 98.87% and a recall value of 99.57% but only a precision value of 20.01% on the test data as indicated in Table 1. Accuracy precision and recall are calculated for every sample image through comparison between the position predicted by the model and the position labeled by manually which is difficult to avoid making mistakes. According to our analysis the main reason for high precision high recall and low precision is that the vortices cores are distributed sparsely on the density images and even if none of the vortices cores are detected such as all 0 (less than threshold 0.5) the accuracy will also be high as shown in Fig. 3a. More importantly we can find that some results detected by the model are very close to the actual vortices cores centers though some of the labeled data has errors. Moreover the vortices cores with missing labels are automatically detected as shown with the yellow box denoted by the yellow box denoted by 2 in Fig. 3b. According to the results provided for in the model most of the vortices cores were detected but many ambiguous pixels were also detected around the ground truth. The number of detected vortices cores is much greater than the actual number as shown in Fig. 3b which leads to the low precision. In Fig. 3c the white circles indicate that the labeled pixels are among the detected results and the red cross indicates that the labeled pixels are not among the detected results. Figure 3de show the magnification of the red box area denoted by 1 in Fig. 3ab respectively and the numbers in Fig. 3e show the probability of the output result \((>0.5)\). In Fig. 3e we can find that the pixel with the highest probability of the model detected result is just the true vertex core position but the labeled pixel is the pixel near the ground truth which is not detected by the model. Therefore we adjust the position of the labeled pixel to the maximum probability of the detected results and reliable the data set for training and testing.

Figure 3 The locations of the vortex cores within each image are shown as red dots for the model prediction (b) and by white circles for the artificial labeling (a). In (c) the white circle means that the labeled points are among the predicted points and the red cross means that the labeled points is not among the forecast points. (d) is a magnification of the red box 1 marked area in (a) and (e) is a magnification of the red box 1 marked area in (bc). The numbers denoted in figure (e) is the predicted probability values.

Training model by the ACL iteration data

We use a new ACL method to relate the vortices cores position. After setting the threshold value (0.9) to the output of the model by which the probability values less than 0.9 are reduced to 0 as times the mask. Then non-maximum suppression (NMS) method5152 is used to remove neighbouring ambiguous pixels detected. We create a window centered on the pixel position of the maximum probability and suppress all other pixels in the window to 0 so as to iterate this process to all nonzero values in each image sample. In Eq. (3) \(I_{i-1}\) represents the input density image to be detected NN represents the neural network function Mask represents the thresholding operation NMS represents the non-maximum suppression operation B represents the binary classification operation and \(L_i\) represents the labeling data by ACL in which i represents the iteration time. The pseudo processing of ACL is shown in the Fig. 4 in which we threshold all values below than 0.9 and use the NMS window size of \(3 \times 3\). Finally the yellow pixel position is labeled as the new vortex core position.

$$\begin{aligned} {\mathscr {L}}_{i}=B(NMS(NN(I_{i-1}) \times Mask)). \end{aligned}$$ (3)

Figure 4 Schematic diagram of the pseudo processing of ACL in which the threshold is 0.9 and the NMS window size is \(3 \times 3\) as the blue box shown. Full size image

In the actual experiment we choose the size of window of MNS in our data set to be \(5 \times 5\) and thus ensure that the size is chosen sufficiently fine that at most one vortex core is present in any window as shown in Fig. 5. From the experimental results the ACL method can automatically adjust the position of labeled vortex cores position and it’s more accurate than the manual labeling for exact pixels.

The probability output of the model with the threshold of 0.5 has many ambiguous points around the exact vortices cores position as shown in Fig. 5b. The red boxes in Fig. 5 represent the probabilities of points are greater than 0.5 but we want to remove them. So in ACL we set the threshold value to 0.9. Then to do away with the neighbouring ambiguous points the NMS method is also used for the output result. The relabeled vortices cores are denoted by white circles in Fig. 5c.

The performance of the model is measured by four metrics namely Accuracy (\({\mathscr {A}}\)) Precision (\({\mathscr {P}}\)) Recall (\(\mathscr {R}\)) and F1-score (F1). The F1-score is the harmonic mean of the recall and precision and these metrics are defined as follows:

$$\begin{aligned} {\mathscr {A}} =\frac{\textrm{TP}}{\mathrm {TP+FP+}TN+FN}\quad {\mathscr {P}}=\frac{\textrm{TP}}{\mathrm {TP+FP}}\quad {\mathscr {R}}=\frac{\textrm{TP}}{\mathrm {TP+FN}}\quad \textrm{Fl}=\frac{2\times \mathrm {P\times R}}{\mathrm {P+R}} \end{aligned}$$ (4)

where \(\textrm{TP}\) \(\textrm{FP}\) \(\textrm{TN}\) and \(\textrm{FN}\) denote the number of true positives false positives true negatives and false negatives respectively in all of the test samples where each sample has \(128 \times 128\) pixels to calculate. These four values all ranges from 0 to 1 with a higher value denoting more accurate detection. After using the NMS method to the predicted probability outcome the precision and \(\textrm{F1}\) score value are dramatically increased while the recall value is somewhat decreased as shown in Table 1.

Table 1 Detector performance metrics (accuracy precision recall and F1 score) are computed on the test data using manual labeling and ACLs. Full size table

Figure 5 (a) is the input image of the condensate density. (b) is the probability output of the model by threshold over 0.5 in which red boxes indicate ambiguous points. (c) is the labeled data using ACL. Full size image

To improve the performance of the model and make the metrics more accurately represent the model results we use the labeled data by ACL and retrain the model. Then we carry out a second ACL on the labeled data from the first ACL (\(i=2\) in Eq. 3). The relabeled data from the second ACL is then used and the retained model is used to perform a third ACL on the data from the second ACL and so on. The general process is: rough labeling \(\rightarrow \) machine learning \(\rightarrow \) probability region searching \(\rightarrow \) relabeling the data \(\rightarrow \) machine learning again. In Table 1 all the metrics are improved after ACL are iterated four times. The prediction metrics of both F1 score and accuracy by using manual labeling and ACL are gradually improved with the number of iterations as shown in Fig. 6. Figure 6 shows that the first use of ACL improved the metrics dramatically and then improved slowly after each iteration. We also find that the increase of ACL iteration times can improve accuracy slightly and F1 score greatly especially F1 score after NMS which is our detection method in practice as shown by the black dashed line in Fig. 6. NMS is essential for this peculiar vortex core detection problem because the pixels around the ground truth position also detect as high probability values which are hard to judge directly with a threshold value.

Figure 6 Accuracy and F1 score versus manual labeling and iterative ACLs for prediction output by thresholding only and by both thresholding and NMS. Full size image

To compare with the observed problems in Fig. 1 the labeled regions using 4th ACL and the model predictions (using NMS) were observed in magnification as shown in Fig. 7. We randomly selected 2 test samples and the zoomed in the area around the labeled position. From the magnification area of the red box it can be seen that the 4th ACL labeled position and the predicted position all have been located at the ground truths.

Figure 8 Structure block diagram of calculation method of label accuracy. Full size image

In order to demonstrate that ACL method can indeed correct false manual labeling we use label accuracy and label error distance to compare before and after ACL with ground truth labels. The calculation flow is shown in Fig. 8. Label accuracy (LA) is the percentage of the altered labels over the ground truth labels which is as defined as follows:

$$\begin{aligned} LA = \frac{1}{N} \sum _{i=1}^{N}\left( \sum _{j=1}^{S} \frac{I_j}{S}\right)  \end{aligned}$$ (5)

where N denotes the number of test samples S denotes the number of vortex core on the ith sample \(I_j\) is 0 if the label point is not matched with the ground truth label point or 1 if the label point is matched with the ground truth label point. Obviously this LA metric can calculate the effectiveness of using the ACL method to adjust the position of the label points.

We also use another metric label error distance (LED) to observe the change of labeling correction with ACL method which is defined as follows:

$$\begin{aligned} LED = \sum _{i=1}^N \frac{ d_1+d_2+ \cdots +d_S}{S} \end{aligned}$$ (6)

where N denotes the number of test samples S denotes the number of vortex core on the ith sample \(d_j\) is the distance between the label point and the ground truth label point in pixels.

It can be obtained from the calculation of Eq. (5) that the metrics of LA is the higher the better indicating that the more labels are matched with the ground truth labels. On the other side label error distance (LED) is the lower the better indicating that the pixel position of labels is closer to the ground truth labels’ pixel position. From Table 2 we can see that the accuracy of the labeling has been greatly improved by the ACL method from 65.89% to 83.44% which is improved greatly. It is worth noting that the second iteration of ACL results in a decrease in LA value although it still higher than before using ACL. And the values of LA barely change as we continue to iterate. The results of this experiment are different from those obtained by the previous iterative ACL method. In addition the value of LA and the value of LED are inversely correlated and we can get the same conclusion from the value of LED in the Table 2.

Table 2 Label accuracy (LA) and label error distance (LED) stands for the effectiveness of the ACL method. Full size table

Furthermore we use the trained model and ground truth label data to calculate the F1 score. From Table 1 the F1 score is only 66.36% by using the manual mislabeled data compared with the F1 score of 83.01% by using the ground truth labels in Table 2. This can prove that even if the manual labeling is not completely correct these data can still be used to train the U-Net and get good detection results which is a feature of the U-Net network that has not yet been proved by the data as far as we know. The F1 score with ground truth labeling has also been improved by the ACL method from 83.01 to 86.36%. But it is decreased with the second iterative ACL and the F1 score increases slightly with the number of iterations but it is still less than when the ACL was first used. This differs from Fig. 6 where the F1 score increases as the number of iterations of ACL increases. This means that with this iterative ACL method labels agree with whatever the U-Net model favors. Therefore in practical application it is meaningful to use this ACL method for the first time not only to adjust the manual mislabeled data but also to get a higher metrics score based on the adjusted labeling data.

In order to establish appropriate uncertainties and demonstrate the generality of the ACL method we artificially created 1000 data samples and experimented with fivefold cross-validation. Each sample is an image of \(128 \times 128\) pixels on which N \((1<N<36)\) partially overlapping two-dimensional Gaussian functions are randomly superimposed. The purpose of the experiment is to accurately detect the vertex positions of all Gaussian functions. First we randomize the positions of vertices in the training data set (800 samples) to simulate human mislabeling data and use the model in Fig. 2 to train the training data set and calculate the evaluation metrics on the test data set (200 samples) which vertex positions are ground truth. Then we run the ACL method using the trained model and re-train a new model to compare the results of evaluation metrics with the pre-trained model. We repeated the experiment five times in the cross-validation and obtained the results as shown in Table 3.

Table 3 The comparison of the evaluation metrics (precision recall and F1 score) between the model trained on the original data of artificial randomized superposition of 2D Gaussian functions and the model trained after ACL adjustment in the fivefold cross-validation. Full size table

From all the above experiments it is concluded that this ACL method can improve the performance of vertex position detection model during training in the case of training data is not very accurate. From the data of Table 3 we can also find a trend that when the evaluation metrics of the original model is better the ACL method is more effective in improving the model’s performance. For example in experiment 3 the F1 score was increased from 82.33 to 99.09% by using ACL.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ0aW5zaWdodHMuY29tL3JlYWwtdGltZS1hbmFseXRpY3MtbmV3cy1mb3ItdGhlLXdlZWstZW5kaW5nLWRlY2VtYmVyLTIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Real-time Analytics News for the Week Ending December 2,"In this week’s real-time analytics news: Amazon Web Services and its partners made many announcements at the annual re: Invent conference.

To avoid the old adage of “garbage in garbage out” it makes sense that you should spend considerable time understanding and cleaning your data. I recently read “The Kaggle Book” by Konrad Banachewicz & Luca Massaron where they interview many Kaggle grandmasters. Interestingly rushing or skipping the EDA is the most common mistake they and beginners make.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNDY3LTAyMy00MzgzNi010gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Language models and protocol standardization guidelines for accelerating synthesis planning in heterogeneous ...,"Annotation and extraction of synthesis actions

In our study we targeted reviewing SAC literature from when the term was introduced in 2010 to 2021 identifying nearly 1200 papers. Of these 569 were experimental reports while the remainder comprised reviews and theoretical studies. We focused on experimental papers from which we manually reviewed 145 publications aiming to analyze the trends in synthetic routes investigated across various thermo- electro- and photochemical reactions (Supplementary Note 1). Synthesis routes of SACs typically encompass various steps such as mixing wet deposition pyrolysis filtering washing and annealing. Conventionally these procedures are reported within the “Methods” sections of scientific articles as unstructured natural language-based textual descriptions. Our goal was to extract all relevant synthesis steps related conditions and the resulting material compositions into a structured format as exemplified in Fig. 3a. To facilitate our analysis we defined the synthesis of SACs as the process starting from the metal precursor and carrier or carrier precursor and continuing until a catalytic material containing single atoms stabilized on a support is obtained. Using this definition we classified the reported synthetic approaches into eight categories and an additional post-synthetic treatment step (Supplementary Table 1).

The sentence to annotate is displayed on the left while the annotation procedure is depicted on the right. Selection of the edit property button opens a separate tab where the action can be edited. Full size image

To develop a framework for extracting and analyzing this information we initially identify the most commonly used synthetic steps that could later be used as action terms for annotation purposes (Supplementary Note 2 Supplementary Table 2). We further analyzed the frequency of occurrence of synthetic steps in the same subset of 145 publications through manual analysis. Each step involves several relevant parameters such as the temperature temperature ramp atmosphere and duration in the case of pyrolysis. These details need to be clearly defined and can be customized depending on the required level of detail. Thus all such synthetic steps and essential parameters necessary to replicate the experiments were identified and labeled as action terms (Supplementary Table 3).

The action terms were then used to manually annotate a randomized subset of 127 synthesis paragraphs (approximately 25% of the total paragraphs compiled) comprising 936 sentences. The annotation was performed on the dedicated software as shown in Fig. 3b. (see “Methods” for details). Using this set of annotated paragraphs and combining it with previously annotated set for organic synthesis17 we fine-tuned a pretrained transformer model17 to devise our ACE (sAC transformEr) model which translates full-length unstructured sentences from entire paragraphs into a structured machine-readable sequence of information (see “Methods” for details and Supplementary Note 3). We evaluated the fidelity of our model based on metrics such as the Levenshtein similarity and BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scores. With an overall Levenshtein similarity of 0.66 our ACE model can capture and extract approximately 66% of information from synthesis protocols into correct action sequences while a BLEU score of 52 attests to the high-quality translation of synthesis sentences from natural language into machine-readable formats (Supplementary Note 4)

To maximize the potential of this language model for automated extraction of synthetic protocols we wanted to make it easily accessible to a broad audience and more specifically experimental researchers. For this purpose we developed a web application and open-sourced it at synthesis_protocol_extraction. Synthetic and computational researchers can easily access this tool requiring no prior programming or coding experience.

Accelerating literature analysis and synthesis insights

The ACE model serves the dual purpose of synthetic protocol text mining and collective analysis of this literature data to reveal interesting patterns. As such this model serves as an invaluable tool to catalysis practitioners as it expedites literature review practice which is often routine tedious and time-intensive. We estimate the time spent on one single paper and for collecting details on the metal speciation composition synthetic route and reaction types by a SAC researcher to be approximately 30 min without any help and under 1 min with our ACE model. Scaling this effort to 1000 publications would cumulatively result in a minimum of 500 man-hours in an ideal case scenario while text mining these publications by the ACE model would take a mere 6–8 h (a set of 300 papers were text mined in less than 2 h for quantification) offering over 50-fold reduction in the time invested for literature analysis- and thus demonstrating the true worth of language models.

The results of our analysis on the synthesis of SACs complement existing domain knowledge thereby instilling greater confidence in the model output. By applying topic queries to articles reporting SACs for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and CO 2 reduction reaction (CO 2 RR) applications accounting for approximately one-third of the reports in our database we identified the most frequently used metals and metal precursors carrier materials and solvents (Fig. 4a b). Our analysis revealed that Fe is one of the most commonly investigated metals for the ORR reaction with Fe-based precursors typically involving chlorides or nitrates. The model findings also revealed that carbons derived from zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIF-8) are a popular choice for carrier materials in ORR applications due to their high surface areas microporous structures chemical and thermal stabilities and synthesis controllability with ZIF-8 synthesized from 2-methylimidazole and Zn(NO 3 ) 2 via solvothermal and solvent methods being prevalent. The analysis also provides valuable insights into the temperatures applied during thermal treatments in SAC synthesis for example pyrolysis annealing and reductive treatments (Fig. 4c). A broad range of temperatures are used in all cases but distinct peaks are observed. These are typically around 1173 K for annealing and pyrolysis steps. Reduction treatments usually activate the catalyst at lower temperatures (373–423 K). For SACs subjected to heat treatment two distinct peaks are observed where the evidenced distribution at lower temperatures could plausibly account for instances where the catalyst was subjected to heat treatment (573–623 K) post the metal stabilization on the carrier.

Though the above enterprise presents valuable information to synthesis experts for informed decision-making during the experimental planning stages we realize that the seamless automation of text-mined synthetic protocols to create comprehensive SAC repositories or databases is far from realization and requires extensive manual intervention. We highlight and attribute this limitation to the absence of uniform data presentation and lack of standards in writing protocols64445. This discrepancy consumes valuable time and introduces the risk of misinterpretation and inaccuracies in the process. For example we observe that the commonly used solvent ethanol is referred to using various terminologies such as ‘ethanol’ ‘C 2 H 5 OH’ ‘EtOH’ and ‘EOH’ in different publications. While human researchers can recognize these variations as referring to the same chemical entity language models often treat them as distinct substances. This issue becomes increasingly complex when dealing with multiple such precursors solvents and associated chemicals presented under various nomenclatures. Similarly we notice that the term ‘heating’ is synonymously used for pyrolysis carbonization or annealing thereby rendering challenges for the model to determine the appropriate thermal-treatment method. Developing a language model capable of accurately identifying and accounting for all such chemical entities and unit operations is formidable. In light of these challenges we emphasize the critical importance of data standardization in scientific publications. Only through enhanced data uniformity can we pave the way for broader applications of language models in chemistry and catalysis-related tasks thereby advancing interdisciplinary research and innovation in these fields.

Model adaptability and limitations

Visualizing the data extracted by the model sheds valuable insights into the unit operations related to synthesis across publications. Our findings reveal a close alignment between the distribution of action terms predicted by the ACE model and the annotated synthesis steps also referred to as ground truth (Fig. 5a). Notably the ACE model demonstrates a remarkable accuracy in predicting action terms such as ThermalTreatment SynthesisProduct Centrifuge Transfer etc. Furthermore we note the recurrent presence of action terms such as Add Stir MakeSolution ThermalTreatment DrySolid Wash and Concentrate etc. in the distribution list. This observation aligns with our initial manual analysis where we statistically inferred the predominance of solution-phase and high-temperature procedures and their hybrid forms in SAC synthesis and these encompass the aforementioned action terms. This in turn demonstrates the model’s prediction prowess.

Fig. 5: Predictive and generalization capabilities of the ACE model. a Distribution of action types for the test set determined by ground truth (human annotation) and by the ACE model. The action terms are ordered in decreasing frequency of the ground truth. b Generalization of the model to a broader class of heterogeneous catalysts. A sample of 18 paragraphs encompassing synthetic protocols on mono- bimetallic and promoted catalysts with 202 action sequences resulted in an HMI of 69%. Source data are provided in the source data file. Full size image

Here we rationalize that since the ACE model is purely data-driven and effectively identifies action steps related to solution-phase and high-temperature synthesis methods its predictive capabilities should not be limited to SAC protocols. Instead it has the potential to be adapted for a broader category of heterogeneous catalysts that are prepared by similar synthetic routes. Within heterogeneous catalyst research supported mono- bimetallic and promoted systems are amongst the most investigated materials often prepared using wet-chemistry techniques like precipitation impregnation and sol-gel methods among others. Extending the model’s application to extract synthetic protocols of these catalysts would prove its ability to generalize across various catalyst types.

To test this hypothesis we selected a randomized subset of 18 synthesis paragraphs from the literature on a few prominent reactions including CO 2 hydrogenation acetylene hydrochlorination and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. These paragraphs were subjected to the ACE model prediction resulting in 202 action sequences (Supplementary Note 6). To determine the model accuracy we devised a simple yet effective evaluation metric termed human machine-readability index (HMI) (see Methods for details). Here we observed that of the total sample size the ACE model could predict 125 actions correctly inclusive of all essential information 28 sentences were partially correct while 49 sentences were predicted wrongly resulting in the HMI of 69%. (Fig. 5b) To put into context this inferred that the model could extract approximately 69% of information from the evaluated paragraphs implying that it could generalize and extract synthesis details with accuracies similar to SAC synthesis as described in the earlier section. These findings quantitatively prove that the ACE model can be extended to extract operations from texts of other families of heterogeneous catalysts with minimal training data or the definition of new action types to cover different catalytic reactions of interest.

However it should be noted that the automated extraction of action sequences for SAC synthesis is a first step in this direction an ongoing effort with its limitations including the current accuracy level inability to extract details of grouped information and failure to capture gas and vapor phase and electrochemical routes (Supplementary Note 7). For instance when the model encounters a synthetic protocol where the catalysts are prepared with different metal contents or activated at different temperatures where all the experimental details are written in parenthesis the model typically retrieves one of the given values or assigns an arbitrary value to the respective action term. Furthermore the predictive prowess of the model is inherently compromised on encountering less standard synthesis protocols for example gas-phase or electrochemical. Based on the model prediction it is evident that essential procedures like plasma treatment and configuration of the plasma chamber for gas-phase and details including type of electrodes calibrations and cycles for electro are currently not well captured. The poor generalization is primarily due to the absence of these steps as action terms due to the scarcity of these methods in the training set of paragraphs for annotation. This is a significant limitation to bear in mind when using the model for prediction or extraction in these areas. Nevertheless we believe that curating action terms specific to these routes and supplementing the model training with these potential new terms will scale its accuracy proportionately.

Improving machine-readability through protocol standardization

Examination of the incorrect predictions of the ACE model reveals that the errors are often minor involving the omission of one or two action terms. These errors are frequently acceptable alternatives to the ground truth. To improve the model performance we propose two systematic approaches. First we recommend increased annotation of synthesis paragraphs followed by model retraining and the addition of new annotation terms corresponding to synthesis steps where the model is least confident. Second we advocate for standardizing the way synthesis protocols and experimental results are reported in literature to facilitate efficient text mining and automated data analysis. Towards this goal we offer eight guidelines to standardize synthesis paragraph writing (Fig. 6a b).

(i) Publishers and journals should require detailed synthesis protocols as Supplementary Information to free authors from word limits and (self-)plagiarism constraints allowing for more accurate descriptions which would improve synthetic reproducibility and model training. (ii) Chemical composition and targeted properties (e.g. metal nuclearity in supported metal catalysts) of synthesized catalysts the procedure used to prepare them should be explicitly mentioned to ensure accurate correlation of synthesis details with samples. (ii) Supplier details and grade of all chemicals used in the study should be given in a uniform format. For our model providing them as a single sentence at the beginning of the paragraph rather than listing them at the first occurrence of the chemical entity improves the performance. (iii) Specify exact quantities of chemicals rather than writing mathematical expressions in ratios will improve machine readability which would otherwise require the development of specific calculations to decode the formulation entailing separate challenges. (iv) Keep protocols concise excluding elaborated discussion of choices of synthetic steps. Additionally separate descriptions of characterization techniques from synthesis paragraphs. (v) Provide details on all samples reported rather than focusing on the best-performing catalyst. If multiple samples for example of distinct composition are prepared following the same synthetic procedure we propose that such details and the speciation of these SACs be separately listed in a tabular format after the synthesis paragraphs. (vi) Use standardized terms for synthesis steps and catalyst vocabulary. This requires more effort from the scientific community to develop and adopt standardized definitions. (vii) Publish all synthesis-related datasets with every manuscript for transparency and reproducibility.

The color codes used include red yellow and green for incorrect partially correct and correct predictions respectively. Source data are provided in the source data file. Full size image

We performed a demonstration test to evaluate our premise that protocol standardization can improve machine-readability (Supplementary Note 8). From the pool of SAC literature compiled in this study we randomly selected 11 paragraphs where the SACs were prepared by wet-chemistry routes and labeled them as pristine paragraphs. Subjecting these paragraphs to the ACE model resulted in 151 action sequences where we observed fully correct and partially correct predictions on 99 and 19 actions respectively while 33 were predicted incorrectly resulting in an HMI of 72%. We then modified the pristine paragraphs to comply with the first five proposed guidelines which are straightforward to implement and termed them as standardized paragraphs. On assessing the model on these paragraphs 156 actions sequences were generated comparable to the pristine action set. Interestingly here the correct action sequences increased to 130 while the partially correct and incorrect actions were reduced to 8 and 18 respectively. This in turn resulted in an HMI of 86% - a significant 14% increase compared to the pristine counterpart (Fig. 6c). It is worth mentioning in comparison to increasing training set size or synthetic data augmentation as discussed in the earlier section where we notice meager increments in model performance (c.a. 2–3%) under various scenarios data standardization offers a more promising alternative to improve model fidelity and machine-readability. More importantly as a proof-of-concept we successfully demonstrate the significance of protocol standardization and its indispensable role in machine-reading and NLP-related tasks in chemistry and catalysis.

The guidelines proposed for protocol standardization are not limited to the above cause but can be conveniently translated to manage data in heterogeneous catalysis as per the FAIR (Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reusable) principles4446. For instance in addition to the synthesis protocols being written in the Supplementary Information authors can also submit the same in online repositories for easier and enhanced accessibility. Along with the metadata of the protocols including but not limited to who when and where the synthesis was performed details on the supplier and grade of the chemicals and equipment or reactors used during synthesis will allow for greater reproducibility of the protocols complying with FAIR principles. An alternative to online repositories would be to list the details of the synthesis protocols including catalyst properties and synthesis approach quantities of precursors solvents and supports and the respective unit operations in a succinct manner in Excel sheets or customized electronic lab notebooks (ELNs) in tabular formats such that all the above information are efficiently managed through the life-cycle of the project. These synthesis datasets should be published with every manuscript. Furthermore details of similar procedures could be seamlessly listed in tabular formats within ELNs making data interoperable. Here we highlight that the objective of protocol standardization by no means intends to limit the creativity of the experimental researcher but rather encourage scientific writing and data reporting practices so that it can be translated to meet the requirements of text mining approaches. Another forward looking alternative would be to write synthesis procedures as a sequence of actions rather than plain texts. We believe such practices if fostered would encourage experimentalists to list procedures in the correct sequence of actions along with all necessary details essential to replicate the experiment. Such formats would not only benefit the experimental community but also be greatly advantageous for text mining and language models endeavors. Overall through such protocol and data reporting standardization efforts which inadvertently improves the quality of data we anticipate text mining approaches be it natural language processing association rule learning sequential pattern mining pattern tracking etc. to effectively work with small datasets and minimal training ultimately leading to their greater acceptance is chemistry and catalysis research."

MEMPHIS Tenn — Tigers fans might be feeling some déjà vu — Iowa State is set to play Memphis for the AutoZone Liberty Bowl game at the end of the month.

The 65th AutoZone Liberty Bowl game will see the two teams facing off in the same venue they did in 2017 when Iowa narrowly beat the Tigers 21-20. This year's game will be televised nationally on ESPN and is said to start at 2:30 p.m. at Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium.

In fact this year will mark the Iowa Cyclones' fourth Bowl game as the team played in 1972 and 2012 as well.

""It’s been a highly successful season for the Memphis Tigers"" executive director of the AutoZone Liberty Bowl Steve Ehrhart said. ""Coach Ryan Silverfield and his team have won nine games and this makes their 10th-straight bowl appearance. It’s only the second time in our 65-year history to have the University of Memphis in the AutoZone Liberty Bowl. We had a packed stadium back in 2017 and expect the same again this year.""

The AutoZone Liberty Bowl can be reached at (901) 795 7700 for event and game tickets. The Memphis Ticket Office also reportedly is selling tickets through this website.

""With the planned major renovations to Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium this year’s AutoZone Liberty Bowl takes on even more significance for the Memphis community"" Ehrhart said. ""We’re proud to host the Tigers and their outstanding fans as we join hands to send a resounding message that both organizations are strong and the investment in the stadium are needed and also vital to the future of both the AutoZone Liberty Bowl and Tiger Football.""

Ehrhart said he is ""thrilled"" to welcome back the Iowa State Cyclones.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb21tZXJjaWFsYXBwZWFsLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9zcG9ydHMvY29sbGVnZS9tZW1waGlzLXRpZ2Vycy8yMDIzLzEyLzAzL21lbXBoaXMtZm9vdGJhbGwtYm93bC1nYW1lLTIwMjMtY29sbGVnZS1mb290YmFsbC1zY2hlZHVsZS83MTcxMjU0NzAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Memphis football to play Iowa State in AutoZone Liberty Bowl to cap 2023 season,"Memphis football knows its postseason destination and opponent.

The Tigers (9-3 6-2 American Athletic Conference) will meet Iowa State (7-5 6-3 Big 12) in the AutoZone Liberty Bowl on Dec. 29 (2:30 p.m. CT ESPN) it was announced Sunday. Memphis will have a chance to earn a rare 10-win season if it can beat the Cyclones in a unique situation at its home stadium.

Though the Tigers fell short of their goal to reach the AAC title game they won three more games in 2023 than they did in 2022. Memphis lost to the three teams it was an underdog against — Missouri Tulane and SMU — and beat the nine teams it was favored to beat.

Almost every game was close at some point whether or not the Tigers ultimately won. Between the win over Navy on Sept. 14 and the loss to SMU on Nov. 18 Memphis both trailed and led in every game it played. That included a last-minute touchdown drive to salvage a win at North Texas an overtime win over Charlotte and a loss to Tulane when the Tigers were up by double-digits in the second half.

The Liberty Bowl typically pits a Big 12 team against an SEC team but Memphis ended up in the game because there were not enough bowl-eligible SEC teams to fill all the conference's bowl slots. That opened the door for an AAC team to get that spot and the Liberty Bowl chose the hometown team.

The Cyclones are returning to a bowl game after going 4-8 in 2022. This game will be a rematch of the 2017 Liberty Bowl when Iowa State beat Memphis 21-20.

Last season Memphis beat Utah State in the SERVPRO First Responders Bowl.

Memphis will serve as the American Athletic Conference’s representative after the Southeastern Conference failed to have enough bowl-eligible teams to meet the game’s contractual obligations for an SEC-versus-Big 12 matchup. This announcement comes on the heels of news that the City of Memphis has a pending resolution to move its ownership of Simmons Bank Liberty Stadium to the University of Memphis as early as December 30th. A victory in the AutoZone Liberty Bowl which will be played on December 29th would serve as a fitting inauguration party for the Memphis Football program.

The Tigers’ first appearance in their hometown bowl game since 2017 Memphis will have a second shot at a Power 5 opponent after falling to the Top-10 Missouri Tigers in St. Louis earlier this season. Regardless of the Big 12’s representative in the game many would assert the late bowl season matchup to be the biggest of Ryan Silverfield’s head coaching career and the most important bowl game since the Tigers appeared in the Cotton Bowl in 2019. The Iowa State Cyclones who the Tigers also played in 2017 look to be the Tigers’ most probable pairing when the game is officially announced later today. Other projected Big 12 representatives include West Virginia and Central Florida.

Finishing the regular season with a dominating 45-21 victory over Temple the 2023 Tigers became just the 10th team in program history to win 9 games in a season and a win in the AutoZone Liberty Bowl could move Ryan Silverfield’s team into even rarer territory. Not only would a victory give the Tigers their most significant bowl win ever but it would be just the fifth team in the program’s 109-year history to win 10 or more games in a season. Accompany this with stadium renovations seemingly moving forward as planned several key Tigers announcing their intention to return next season and an estimated bowl payout of over $4 million the Memphis Tigers have one final opportunity to conclude the season with an exclamation point."

Might even be the best team in the state overall.

“That’s for you guys to decide” Boyle County coach Justin Haddix said.

The Rebels dominated the Class 4A state championship game with Covington Catholic at Kroger Field in Lexington taking down the Colonels 41-0 for their fourth straight state title.

There wasn’t much Boyle did wrong on Friday night under the bright lights a spot they’re all too familiar with over the past four seasons. They racked up 413 yards while holding CovCath to 64 the first time the Colonels have been shut out since Dec. 11 2020 a 20-0 loss to Bowling Green in the state semifinals.

“There’s no reason to sugarcoat anything they beat us in all three phases of the game tonight” Colonels coach Eddie Eviston said. “We tip our hat to them. Great football team. We ran into a buzzsaw tonight.” The Covington Catholic faithful didn’t have much to cheer for Friday night. Brandon Wheeler | LINK nky contributor

Early momentum was in the Rebels favor converting on a 3rd-and-17 on one drive a 4th-and-2 on another to set up their first two scores.

“Anytime you’re in a game like this you want to start off strong but we just put ourselves behind the 8-ball” Eviston said. “Offense put our defense in bad positions special teams put our defense in bad positions and we just couldn’t stop them. A lot of third down conversions a lot of fourth down conversions.”

Montavin Quisenberry was the common factor in the first half his first scoring run coming from 13 yards out after making a couple tacklers miss for a 6-0 Rebels lead with 2:38 left in the first. After an Avery Bodner run for a touchdown from a yard out in the second Quisenberry made it 20-0 with 5:16 left before halftime on a 39-yard punt return for a score his third punt return for a touchdown this season.

The Colonels had a chance to get something going in the late stages of the half but a drive stalled out near midfield on a sack the Rebels collecting four on the day on Evan Pitzer.

While Boyle was able to pick up third and fourth down conversions throughout the Colonels struggled to do so collecting just six first downs in the contest.

Avery Bodner’s second touchdown run from nine yards out made it 27-0 Sage Dawson also finding paydirt on a nine-yard run to make it 34-0 with 40 seconds left in the third.

The Rebels got the game to a running clock with 6:56 left to play when Dawson hit Geordon Brown for a 32-yard touchdown pass.

They end out on top for the fourth straight season which also happens to be how long Haddix has been with the program.

“Been an emotional week. Some people talk about family and all this but it really is a family. We expect a lot out of them and put too much into this and be our best and be remembered” Haddix said. “Emotional when you think about it trying not to think about losing some of these guys going to enjoy this one tonight.”

The Colonels were making their first state championship appearance since 2019 their 23 seniors closing out their season with a 14-1 record and one game shy of the program’s ninth state title in program history. In the last four years they went 42-10 and this being their deepest playoff run.

“Very exceptional group of seniors very exceptional group of young men” Eviston said. “Every challenge we put in front of them they were tearing it down. Obviously this was the last one just couldn’t get it done. There’s so many things that go into a high school football team and so many things we do a certain way at Covington Catholic. Very pleased with how these guys handled themselves both on and off the field all year long. Just proud to be their coach.”

The loss dropped Covington Catholic to 8-2 all-time in state championship games.

What is the trilemma facing the energy industry?

As businesses organisations and governments all over the world put more and more effort into decarbonising the economy the energy industry faces a trilemma which can be broken down into three main pillars. Firstly it needs secure affordable and scalable energy to serve a growing population. Secondly that energy must be delivered converted and consumed more efficiently. And thirdly there is a need for new cleaner energy sources to support growth whilst replacing the widespread use of fossil fuels.

Do you think the current conversation around decarbonisation takes into account all three pillars of the trilemma?

The conversation surrounding decarbonisation can often be too narrow which risks neglecting the wider trilemma. Conversations can be dominated around potential solutions like ‘banning all fossil fuels’ which doesn’t take into account how complicated of an issue this is. If we are to succeed in providing robust reliable and affordable energy to everyone on the planet each pillar of the trilemma needs to be addressed.

For example if we look at the first issue there is the need to significantly increase the number of people who have access to electricity. Although an additional one billion people have been given access to electricity in the past few decades there are still around one billion people worldwide who do not have access to electricity. Additionally there is the issue of efficiency – currently around 65% of the energy that is sourced converted and consumed worldwide is wasted through inefficiencies.

So before we even look at the third pillar of the trilemma – developing a new cleaner energy source – there are significant things that can be done to improve the situation in the short term and increase the energy we currently supply through a big improvement in efficiency.

In this endeavour digital engineering is making great strides forward. The application of digital technologies to engineering design simulation optimisation and the operation of systems and processes across the whole life cycle of a product is making a significant contribution to energy efficiency and sustainability – and its contribution will only increase over time.

What can be done in the short term if we are to achieve our net-zero goals?

In the short term whilst we are in a transitional period where new technologies and energy sources are being discovered and developed improving energy efficiency in all products and processes is the best way to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. If efforts are focused on this area it could reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions by up to 40% which would go a long way to helping us achieve our short-term net-zero ambitions. Currently 31% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions footprint comes from converting fossil fuels into electricity and heat; of that electricity a massive 45% is used in electrical motors in isolation. This means that currently 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions produced by humans come from electric motors. This is particularly significant as the global transportation sector is currently embarking on a vast electrification effort meaning that the use of electric motors is set to exponentially increase in the coming decades. As a result any efficiency that can be improved in electric motors could reduce global emissions by a few percent. Although that may sound small this would be a huge win for the planet as this solution is made up of many smaller percentage reductions in the aggregate.

How can digital engineering be employed in the design process to improve sustainability?

It is crucial to consider sustainability right from the off in the design process. This is because the majority of a product’s cost and environmental impact are locked in during the development and design cycle. One such decision that is critical to the overall impact that any product may have is that of materials selection. The materials that are used determine weight and therefore overall efficiency but also the recyclability. This is where the extensive use of digital engineering is pivotal. Firms are able to use digital engineering to input the exact properties of countless materials to be used in their simulations that are done at the beginning of the lifecycle. This means they get full insight into the most energy-efficient and cost-effective materials to use. Once the materials are chosen further simulations can be done to determine the optimal shape and makeup of a product again reducing material usage but critically without reducing strength. All of this works together to make a product that is more efficient in the first instance but also goes a long way to improving the overall life cycle of the product including having less material to recycle at the end of the lifecycle thus reducing energy consumption even further.

How can digital engineering be employed as the energy industry transitions to a more digital future?

On our path to a more sustainable future there are many new technologies that will be employed. The evolution of technologies such as the Internet of Things and 5G communications are driving the digital transformation of the industry as a whole and will play a crucial role moving forward. However the challenge comes with regards to energy assets and infrastructure that were commissioned long ago well before the explosion of the digital age. A big component of shifting the entire industry forward will be installing sensors actuators and communication devices so they can all be incorporated into the Internet of Things and this again is where the extensive use of digital engineering will be critical. It will allow a digital thread to be created that links all assets old and new into a single system that can be monitored by digital twins. Digital twins are a virtual replica of a real-world asset that allows engineers to understand how that asset will work in any given scenario. The use of digital twins allows teams to optimise efficiency reliability durability and real-time performance – all absolutely crucial to ensuring the long-term sustainability of any given product.

Vanguard is a titan in the investment world. Its index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are easy and inexpensive ways to achieve diversification.

If you're familiar with Vanguard the first product that comes to mind is probably something like an S&P 500 index fund its popular growth ETF or its value ETF.

One of the lesser-known but still massive funds is the Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF (VO 0.37%) with $132.6 billion in net assets. Here's why the fund is unique and worth buying now.

Not your typical fund

The Vanguard Mid-Cap Fund holds 338 companies and sports a 0.04% expense ratio which is similar to the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF's (VOO 0.18%) 507 holdings and 0.03% expense ratio. However the big differences between the Mid-Cap ETF and other top Vanguard funds are the weightings by sector and the weightings by individual stock.

The distinction is apparent if we simply look at the weights of the top 10 holdings. In the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF the top 10 holdings which include stocks like Apple and Microsoft make up 32.2% of the fund. The Vanguard Growth ETF is even more concentrated with 56.2% invested in just 10 holdings. And even the Vanguard Value ETF has 23.2% invested in the top 10 stocks.

Flip over to the Mid-Cap Fund and you'll find the largest holding makes up less than 1% of the fund while the top 10 holdings make up just 7.6% of the fund.

Sector breakdown

The weightings by sector between the Mid-Cap ETF and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF are very different as well.

Sector Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF Vanguard S&P 500 ETF Industrials 18.0% 8.3% Technology/Communications 15.7% 36.8% Consumer Discretionary 13.0% 10.6% Financials 12.8% 12.7% Health Care 9.7% 13.2% Real Estate 8.4% 2.4% Utilities 7.9% 2.5% Energy 5.6% 4.5% Consumer Staples 4.9% 6.6% Basic Materials 4.0% 2.4%

As you can see in the table the Mid-Cap Fund sports more than double the industrials allocation more than triple the weighting in real estate and utilities and less than half the weight in technology/communications.

The reason is the fund doesn't reflect the most valuable companies in the same way the S&P 500 does. And it's not going to assign the largest weights to the most important value stocks or growth stocks like other ETFs would do.

Instead the Mid-Cap Fund focuses on smaller but still sizable companies blending value and growth and avoiding ultra-large businesses.

The largest financials holding isn't JPMorgan Chase or Berkshire Hathaway -- its Arthur J. Gallagher. The largest technology holdings aren't Apple and Microsoft they're Amphenol and Arista Networks. The list goes on and on.

It sounds strange on the surface but the dynamic plays out very well in practice. A good example is looking at the energy holdings.

The mid-cap fund has a 5.6% weighting in energy which is similar to the S&P 500 ETF's 4.5% weighting. But while around 2% of the S&P 500 is invested in ExxonMobil and Chevron 2% of the Mid-Cap Fund is invested in Hess Cheniere and Baker Hughes. It's the same idea -- just using a different approach that often leads to higher risk and higher potential reward.

The sector weightings can lead to a far different performance for the Mid-Cap ETF compared to the S&P 500. For example the Mid-Cap ETF is underperforming the broad market by quite a bit this year because the mega-cap tech stocks have contributed the bulk of the S&P 500's gains.

Not a foundational holding

Index funds and ETFs provide low-cost diversification and can do a great job of rounding out a portfolio. The Mid-Cap ETF -- with its specific holdings and sector weightings -- should be viewed as a tool to get exposure to companies you may normally overlook instead of as a foundational holding to build your portfolio around.

For example if you already own plenty of Apple stock then buying an S&P 500 index fund will noticeably add to your Apple exposure which you may not be looking to do. Put another way you may end up double-dipping with the biggest companies instead of achieving true diversification.

With the Mid-Cap ETF you're getting a small piece of many different companies you're less likely to already be invested in. In this sense the ETF is serving a specific role in a portfolio not just doing more of the same thing.

The Mid-Cap ETF is also a better value than the S&P 500 sporting a 17.7 price-to-earnings ratio compared to 21.2 for the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF.

All told the Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF is a unique option that's worth considering now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJ1Z2J5cGFzcy5jb20vbmV3cy91c2EtZ3JlYXQtbWFkaXNvbi1odWdoZXMtcmV2ZWFscy11bmZpbmlzaGVkLWJ1c2luZXNzLWFmdGVyLXN2bnMtcmV0dXJuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,USA great Madison Hughes reveals 'unfinished business' after SVNS return,"With the United States of America failing to medal at the Tokyo Olympics two years ago playmaker Madison Hughes was ready to “move on” and sail into the sunset after a storied sevens career.

Hughes now 31 captained America during a transformational time for the sport’s shorter format in North America. With the USA and Canada impressing it was Hughes who led the way.

In a team that boasted plenty of star power by way of Perry Baker Carlin Isles and Garrett Bender Hughes took the circuit by storm and finished the 2015/16 campaign as the top point scorer.

But that’s just one sentence one season which could never justifiably detail the impact that Hughes had on North American rugby the circuit and the United States sevens program.

Hughes’ skill on the field leadership qualities and experience were simply invaluable to the USA sevens side and the void the playmaker left behind proved hard to fill in the years since his departure.

But with one eye on a third appearance at the Olympics ahead of the 2024 Paris Games Hughes returned to the SVNS circuit for the first time in two years at the season opener in Dubai this month.

In an exclusive interview with RugbyPass after the United States’ quarter-final loss to traditional sevens heavyweights New Zealand Hughes revealed he has “unfinished business” at the Games.

“At the Olympics I feel like I’ve got some unfinished business there. Both in Tokyo and in Rio (we) didn’t quite get the performances we wanted at the Games” Hughes said.



“Would love to have another crack at that bit for not just concentrating on getting back in the mix with the team and trying to reestablish and figure out my role within the team and how I can best push the team forward.

“Kind of had left the door open. The plan was kind of to come back but was figuring out all sorts of things” he added when asked whether it was always the plan to return.

“Almost a dream scenario was that I was happy to move on with my life and I was feeling in a good place but I definitely missed it too much missed being with the boys missed being with the team.

“Excited to be back here and now we’ll see what happens.”

Walking into The Sevens Stadium for the first time in four years as an active United States player on Saturday morning Hughes looked focused ahead of his comeback tournament.

USA opened their campaign with a tough loss to Fiji later that morning but bounced back with big wins over Great Britain and France to round out pool play.

But the All Blacks Sevens proved to be a mountain too tough to climb early on the second day. New Zealand ran away with a relentlessly dominant 40-nil win over Mike Friday’s men.

With the Americans looking to make amends on the SVNS circuit after a year of “inconstancy” in 2022/23 – with the Eagles finishing 10th – the quarter-final defeat offers more lessons to be learnt.

“As we reflect on that game kick-offs are the ones that stand out to me – we just weren’t recovering our own ball and they were recovering a lot of their own kicks” Hughes said.

“We really didn’t have much possession and if you have to defend for very long periods against a team like New Zealand they’re going to start finding gaps.



“I think we have to have a look at that kick-off and then see defensively where they were coming through us.”

Hughes’ return should put a smile on the faces of sevens fans around the world but those very same supporters will also be counting down the days until another American makes his return.

Two-time World Rugby Sevens Player of the Year Perry Baker was rested for the Dubai leg of the 2023/24 SVNS Series after helping the USA qualify for the Olympics.

With Baker and Hughes both in the mix for selection there’s plenty to like about the potential of the USA Eagles Sevens and the heights they could reach if they get things right.

“There’s definitely a little bit of a different balance with the squad. We had a lot of very established people within the team who’ve been there for a long period of time and some of those are still around.

“We’ve got a good young group coming through and I think that’s really exciting to see and that’s what’s going to take the team forward.

“We’ve got guys who are resting this weekend so Perry Baker Kevon Williams Joe Schroeder and Stphen Tomasin – four fantastic players.

“When they come back into the mix I think you’ll see a little bit more of that balance between the experienced guys and that younger exciting group that are coming through.

“It’s a fun balance I think it’s a fun group to be around. I’m 31 now and they’re a bunch of 20 22-year-olds so that’s taking me back to my youth and that’s a good fun team to be in.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uemhlcmFsZC5jby5uei93aGFuZ2FudWktY2hyb25pY2xlL25ld3MvY2FsZW5kYXItZ2lybHMtd3JpdHRlbi1ieS10aW0tZmlydGgtYW1kcmFtcy1sYXRlc3QtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi80MzJMVFYyU1dOQlFCRVdNREdVR0ZJM0dIQS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Calendar Girls written by Tim Firth Amdram’s latest production,"Terry Lobb (assistant director) was the first to shave Geoff Campbell's hair.

Amdram’s latest production Calendar Girls directed by Helen Watson is based on the movie Calendar Girls and the true story of a group of women from Rylstone Women’s Institute North Yorkshire who posed “nude” in a calendar to raise money for a settee.

John Baker died of non-Hodgkins Lymphoma in 1998 at age 54 and was the main inspiration behind the calendar.

His wife Angela spent many hours sitting on a badly sprung old settee in the relatives’ room at Skipton General and after John’s death she and her friend Tricia Stewart decided to raise money for a new settee.

Jacqui Hughes stage wife Annie is about to take over shaving Geoff Campbell's hair from Terry Lobb (assistant director).

The original calendar featured 11 women each taking a month and posing together for December. They sold over 88000 copies. In over 20 years the Alternative WI calendar has raised over £6 million ($12.2m) for Leukaemia Research.

Geoff Campbell plays John Clarke (John Baker) alongside Jacqui Hughes as his wife Annie. We are very fortunate to have a fabulous cast to work with both newbies to our theatre and some returning.

Geoff is no stranger to Amdram both on and off stage and goes all out for his characters. Unfortunately he only gets to play part of the first act before he succumbs to that dreadful decease.

So off with his hair! To get into character we had a ‘shaving’ before rehearsals and let a few cast members loose on him with a razor. Terry Lobb (assistant director) was the first to shave Geoff’s head for a previous show he was in.

The couple were joined by Olivia Rodrigo Paris Hilton and Dixie D'Amelio along with a number of fashionable guests at this year's KIIS FM's iHeartRadio Jingle Ball.

Rodrigo was seen in a tight dark silver mini dress with a low-cut neckline while Hilton - who recently welcomed her second child via surrogate - had all eyes on her in a theatrical shimmering silver dress with a number of star accents along the hem.

Rodrigo was one of the artists who performed at this year's KIIS-FM Jingle Ball which is an annual concert produced by the Los Angeles radio station KIIS-FM.

Other stars performing included Niall Horan AJR Sabrina Carpenter Miguel Doechii Flo Rida (G)I-DLE and P1Harmony.

Robach and Holmes' attendance at the event signals their love is still going strong a little over a year after it was revealed they were an item.

On November 10 2022 the two were spotted at O'Donoghue's bar in Times Square hours after pre-recording their daily segment.

'They were totally into each other' an eyewitness told DailyMail.com.

'She was giggling at whatever he was saying and they were looking at each other's phones. At one point she was kind of dancing in her chair to the music and laughing so hard she practically fell into his lap.'

The following day Holmes was seen leaving his apartment with a backpack and a duffle and after a morning filming heading to a West Village restaurant near Robach's apartment.

Moments later he walked around the corner and headed up the block to where Robach was waiting to pick him up in her BMW convertible.

The pair drove north of the city for a two-hour drive to Shawangunk Mountains where they checked into a cottage nestled in the wilderness.

They checked out on November 13 and Holmes was seen grabbing Robach's rear as she bent to pack up the car.

On November 17 the pair met again after the day's filming ended. Holmes met Robach a Stage 2 breast cancer survivor at NYU Langone Medical Center. Later Robach's friend walked her dog while she and Holmes stayed in her apartment.

The duo were removed from the air less than a month after the photos dropped though viewers were told the change would be 'temporary.'

In January an email memo was sent to staff notifying them of the pair's departure.

'I want to share with you that we've reached a decision about T.J. and Amy' it read.

'After several productive conversations with Amy Robach and T.J. Holmes about different options we all agreed it's best for everyone that they move on from ABC News.

'We recognize their talent and commitment over the years and are thankful for their contributions.'

Robach's ex-husband Andrew Shue wiped all traces of her from social media just days after news of the infidelity broke.

The couple wedded in 2008 following Robach's split from Tim McIntosh and had a blended family including five children from previous marriages.

Likewise Holmes and his ex-wife Marilee Fiebig divorced in December 2022 after reportedly separating that August.

The pair welcomed a baby girl in 2013 and were married for 12 years. Holmes has two other children a son and a daughter from his previous marriage with Amy Ferson.

Later that afternoon the couple were caught in a rare PDA moment as they held hands in the back of an Uber while heading to Robach's apartment

But being removed from the show they first met at did not seem to slow down their love as they were seen running the NYC marathon together last month.

The former stars were among the nearly 50000 runners who flocked to the streets of New York to partake in the tradition.

The race started in Staten Island and sent competitors through the four remaining boroughs before ending in Central Park near the West 60s.

A customer looks at the selection of onigiri available at Musubitei in Shibuya Ward Tokyo in October.

Onigiri rice balls have been gaining popularity domestically as well as in many foreign countries for their delicious taste and healthfulness.

Increased demand for takeout due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to the opening of a number of onigiri specialty stores.

Onigiri is also becoming increasingly popular among health-conscious foreigners leading to the expansion of onigiri shops overseas.

As domestic rice consumption slumps many businesses are trying to find new demand for the “soul food” of Japan.

Using delicious rice

On Oct. 27 Musubitei onigiri shop in Shibuya Ward Tokyo was bustling with customers looking at the onigiri in its display case to decide which one to buy.

The display case is lined with rice balls filled with various ingredients such as salmon ume plum pickled takana greens and mentaiko spiced cod roe.

“The rice is fluffy unlike what I used to eat in China. The onigiri is so delicious that I keep coming back to this shop” said a 31-year-old company employee from China who works for a nearby company.

Tetsuya Kazama 56 president of an audio equipment rental company opened Musubitei in late August hoping that many people would enjoy the rice from his home prefecture of Niigata. He insists on using rice made from koshihikari produced in Uonuma in the prefecture for the onigiri.

The onigiri sold at the shop cost between ¥180 and ¥360 each which is slightly more expensive than onigiri sold at convenience stores but the company sells nearly 500 onigiri a day. Many foreign customers also visit the shop.

“I want people around the world to know the deliciousness of Japanese rice through onigiri. We are also considering the expansion of onigiri shops overseas” Kazama said.

High demand for onigiri

The Yomiuri Shimbun

Customers eat Onigiri rice balls at a restaurant in Osaka on Nov. 21.

Onigiri specialty shops are springing up in many places in the nation with many opened by firms from other industries.

Honnori-ya operated by a subsidiary of East Japan Railway Co. (JR East) has opened eight new shops since April 2022 and now operates 20 shops in the Tokyo metropolitan area.

Zojirushi Corp. also launched its onigiri shop “Zojirushi ginpaku onigiri (silver-white onigiri)” at a department store in Osaka in April 2022.

Ohmoriya Co. a company that specializes in nori dried seaweed opened an onigiri shop called “Nori musubi” in Kyoto where customers can choose from three different types of nori.

The increase in the number of onigiri shops was prompted by the fact that people became accustomed to eating their purchased food at home or at work during the pandemic.

According to a family income and expenditure survey by the Internal Affairs and Communications Ministry expenditures on onigiri and other food items using rice for households of two or more people reached a record high of ¥5172 in 2022.

The price of flour which is an ingredient of bread and noodles temporarily spiked due to Russia’s aggression in Ukraine but the price of rice has remained relatively stable which is one of the reasons why demand for onigiri has increased.

Spreading overseas

Nevertheless per capita consumption of rice has remained stagnant due to the diversification of dietary habits among other factors. After peaking at 118 kilograms in fiscal 1962 rice consumption has continued to decline reaching only approximate estimates of 50.9 kilograms in fiscal 2022.

One tailwind for increased rice consumption is the popularity of onigiri which has begun to spread overseas. Onigiri is attracting attention as an inexpensive healthy food.

The basic ingredients of onigiri are rice seaweed and salt making it easy to eat for people who follow religious dietary restrictions or are vegetarians.

Omusubi Gonbei which has 51 chain stores in Japan has two stores in the United States and two in France.

On a busy day a single store can sell several thousand onigiri each of which costs about ¥400. In the future the company plans to open 1000 stores overseas alone.

Boosting exports

The amount of rice exported overseas for commercial use has been increasing due to a growing number of onigiri shops opened overseas. According to the Agriculture Forestry and Fisheries Ministry the volume was 4516 tons in 2014 and it increased sixfold to 28928 tons in 2022.

As part of efforts to boost overseas exports of rice the ministry launched a strategic project to expand the overseas market for rice in fiscal 2017.

The ministry has been promoting the deliciousness of rice at tasting events in various countries and bringing Japanese and foreign companies together.

“Until now rice has only been featured for using to make sushi but the recent onigiri boom has opened up opportunities to develop the rice market” a ministry official said. “In the future we would like to expand the export of rice not only to North America and Asia where it has been very popular but also to the Middle East and Africa.”

Using substituted ingredients

Convenience store operators have begun attempting to solve social problems through onigiri.

In July Seven-Eleven Japan Co. began selling “mirai deli onigiri tuna mayonnaise” which is tuna mixed with pea protein. The company said this is an effort to address food shortages caused by the world’s growing population.

In August Lawson Inc. began selling frozen onigiri at its outlets in Tokyo and Fukushima Prefecture on a trial basis. The company aims to reduce the number of deliveries from food factories to stores and respond to the so-called 2024 logistics problem an anticipated shortage of labor in logistics-related fields.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm55dGltZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMDMvYnVzaW5lc3MvcHJvLXNwb3J0cy1nYW1ibGluZy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Team's Sale Reflects Growing Links Between Pro Sports and Gambling,"For years professional sports organizations like the National Basketball Association and Major League Baseball prohibited liquor companies from buying advertising in locations in stadiums and arenas that could be seen on television in deference to efforts to curb drunken driving.

But in 2009 during the depths of the worst recession since the Great Depression those same leagues found themselves scrambling for cash as their biggest sponsors — automakers banks and others — cut back on marketing. Suddenly they began signing multimillion-dollar deals with companies that made rum tequila vodka and other hard liquor and the advertising was displayed for all to see.

It was a sign of how justifications can change seemingly overnight especially when money is involved. The sports world was reminded of that last week when Miriam Adelson and her trust sold $2 billion worth of shares in the Sands Corporation a casino operator to buy a professional sports team which turned out to be the Dallas Mavericks. (The purchase still needs to be approved by the league’s board of governors before becoming official.)

“The Adelson and Dumont families are honored to have the opportunity to be stewards of this great franchise” they said in a statement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdldGRyb2lkdGlwcy5jb20vZHJhZ29uLWJhbGwtdGhlLWJyZWFrZXJzLWNyYXNoaW5nLXBjL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Fix: Dragon Ball The Breakers Keeps Crashing on Startup on PC,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.getdroidtips.com/dragon-ball-the-breakers-crashing-pc/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdldGRyb2lkdGlwcy5jb20vZHJhZ29uLWJhbGwtdGhlLWJyZWFrZXJzLWNyYXNoaW5nLXBjL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The agency says Bank of America will pay $12 million for repeatedly sending false information to federal regulators.

The CFPB says BofA has routinely violated the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act which was enacted in 1975.

The law requires lenders to maintain certain records and submit data about loan applications and originations to the CFPB to protect consumers against predatory practices in the residential mortgage market.

The CPFB says that hundreds of BofA loan officers neglected their duty to ask mortgage applicants a number of demographic questions as mandated by federal law. But instead of following up to get the necessary details the loan officers falsely reported that 100% of mortgage applicants opted not to provide their demographic data over a three-month period.

The regulator also says that BofA failed to ensure that its loan officers were providing accurate information on mortgage applications. According to the CFPB the lender’s loan officers were not collecting the required demographic data from mortgage applicants as early as 2013 but BofA chose to overlook the shortcoming.

Says CFPB Director Rohit Chopra

“Bank of America violated a federal law that thousands of mortgage lenders have routinely followed for decades. It is illegal to report false information to federal regulators and we will be taking additional steps to ensure that Bank of America stops breaking the law.”

In addition to the $12 million fine the CFPB is requiring Bank of America to take measures that would stop its illegal data-collection practice.

BANK BLOODBATH Bank of America confirms it’s closing nearly two dozen locations in single state but promises ‘robust’ presence

BANK of America has confirmed it is closing nearly two dozen branches or ATMs in one of the most populous states of the US.

The closures will include locations where ""client traffic has diminished significantly.""

More bad news for the Bay Area California this week as Bank of America confirmed it will close a total of 20 branches and ATMs in the next 90 days.

The chain filed a report to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency confirming the closures as is legally required.

Bank of America spokesperson Colleen Haggerty told SFGate that Bank of America maintains nearly 200 financial centers in the Bay Area.

She said the cuts were made “where centers are located in close proximity to one another or where client traffic has diminished significantly.""

Haggerty also claimed that the increased use of mobile banking has led to a decline in foot traffic.

""We remain confident in this mix of robust retail presence and mobile capabilities that our clients tell us they prefer” she added.

Out of the 20 locations due to shutter four will be gone by the end of 2023 including one in San Francisco.

A further four are slated to close in 2024 including two in the city and a date has not yet been revealed for the remaining 16 closures.

WIDER TREND

Bank of America is the biggest bank operating in the Bay Area according to the San Francisco Business Times.

But the chain has closed a total of 95 locations nationwide this year and a further 15 are expected to shutter before the year is through.

The entire banking industry has moved toward consolidating branches over the last decade with the pandemic only accelerating this trend.

Bank of America rival Wells Fargo has shuttered over 300 branches this year.

And that comes after around 1000 Wells Fargo stores closed in 2022 according to the bank's annual report.

Meanwhile Chase has closed 150 locations this year with more closures slated for 2024.

A total of 14 branches are closing for good in December.

Another bank chain is closing 29 locations.

And see which bank is no more after a merger with a different company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL3Blb3BsZS93ZS1hcmUtYXQtdGhlLWJlZ2lubmluZy1vZi1hLWhlYWx0aHktaXBvLWN5Y2xlLWluLWluZGlhLWJvZmEtbWQtcm95LTExNzAxNjI0MjM3OTEwLmh0bWzSAYUBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGl2ZW1pbnQuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9wZW9wbGUvd2UtYXJlLWF0LXRoZS1iZWdpbm5pbmctb2YtYS1oZWFsdGh5LWlwby1jeWNsZS1pbi1pbmRpYS1ib2ZhLW1kLXJveS9hbXAtMTE3MDE2MjQyMzc5MTAuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,We are at the beginning of a healthy IPO cycle: BofA MD Roy | Mint,"MUMBAI : Often investors reward corporate India to be more cash positive than in debt says Subhrajit Roy managing director and head global capital markets at BofA in an interview. According to him the capital markets activity is expected to pick up pace next year as corporate balance sheets are now deleveraged and capex cycle is getting restarted. Edited excerpts:

It has been a pretty good year for capital markets activity. How do you see the year so far?

The year 2023 has been interesting with activity coming in phases. The first four months were quiet then in May we saw a return of broader risk appetite with block deals leading the way. Blocks have been resilient throughout the last couple of years irrespective of the market conditions. Every quarter blocks have been averaging around $2.5 billion-$3 billion. This year was unprecedented as block deals worth $5 billion were executed in the April-June quarter. This was due to the demand side has pick up and the supply was reasonably stable too. It was never a zero unlike let's say IPOs and follow-ons which had periods of no activity.

IPOs seem to have come back strongly with the recent ones including Tata Technology listing seeing unprecedented demand. Will this continue into 2024?

IPOs have been absorbed well because the domestic demand has always been strong. But I think they're also now being balanced well by FII demand as well. Notwithstanding the overall FII trajectory where we have seen the activity to be choppy. It is a balanced demand scenario in which the outcome is a win-win for both buyers and sellers. And I think generally corporate India sponsors have also been very mindful on how the stock would trade post listing.

I believe we are at the beginning of a very healthy IPO cycle. Though there is a bit of a wait and watch by corporates with regards to the national elections next year I think that if the election outcome has no major surprise there will be a substantial surge in follow on activity.

A number of global brokerages have upgraded Indian equities to outperform in the impact what is your top picks? Does India figure and what is your stance and why?

I think it is well flagged that within emerging markets (EM) India is among the top picks. Now the first or second or third could keep changing depending on which other countries are there in the mix. But I think if we look at reallocation of resources new allocation of resources emerging market markets ex-China everything seems to be favoring India from their perspective especially from geo political stability and relative growth perspectives.

What is your take on India becoming part of the GBI-EM the JP Morgan index from June next year? Is there a flip side to it?

I think it’s too early to say but its long awaited and certainly a move in the right direction. From an Indian market maturity standpoint this has been inevitable. I think the boost in offshore investor participation in domestic markets will certainly pave the way for further deepening of domestic markets and the Indian market has matured well and needs to be nimble to handle orderly inflows and outflows. As markets turn more liquid the ability to handle inflows and outflows credibly is important.

The second quarter results have shown inline earnings but top line has moderated what is the outlook on core performance in the coming quarters.

Part of the reason why we have seen earnings beat the expectations also is the fact that input pressures have eased. So have supply chain disruptions and raw material costs. Also corporate entities have become more efficient in managing costs in general that has been an important mantra post-COVID. Which is why earnings have been pretty well managed apart from some disruptions.

On the overall topline front we feel quite constructive. The Make in India thematic government spends and core sector performance should drive healthy revenue outcomes. The current GDP growth numbers also bear out these trends. The markets however will closely watch the consumption growth across verticals. There is a lot of talk about top tier bottom tier experiential consumption product consumption urban consumption and global consumption. The jury's still out on whether there is broader resilience in consumption. But generally if you see the takeoff of consumption in this festive season people are bullish and probably we will get a better view once the December numbers are out.

Now that the large corporates have deleveraged and the banks too have cleaned up their balance sheets will the India Inc.’s animal spirits return?

Some of that decision making may trigger around the election outcome as well. If we generally speak to corporate India there is a pro capex mindset right now. Will every capex lead to equity funding? Probably not. But the point is capex will start kicking in as corporates feel more sanguine about the growth outlook and stable operating environment. What is also important to note is that corporate India’s attitude towards leverage especially through COVID has rebased to a new normal where there is a preference for cash. Coporates don't mind sitting on more cash than being more pro-debt. We often find investors reward corporate India to be more cash positive than in debt. As a combination of these factors would expect strong capital market activity to follow be it equity or debt once Corporate India meaningfully embarks on this capex cycle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMioAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVyLWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL3BpY3R1cmUtZ2FsbGVyeS9zcG9ydHMvY29sbGVnZS9sb3Vpc3ZpbGxlLzIwMjMvMTIvMDIvbG91aXN2aWxsZS1mbG9yaWRhLXN0YXRlLWZvb3RiYWxsLTIwMjMtYWNjLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC1waG90b3MvNzE3ODUyOTgwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2023 ACC Championship: Louisville vs Florida State football photos,"Louisville football takes on Florida State in 2023 ACC Championship game

The group then marched to Times Square a chorus of voices chanting “Israel bombs USA pays how many kids did you kill today?” echoing through the streets of Manhattan’s West Side.

The event was co-organized by the Palestinian-led community organization Within Our Lifetime (WOL) and the New York-based activist movement Decolonize This Place (DTP) and initially intended as a two-pronged action: a pro-Palestine rally outside the museum followed by an “anti-colonial tour” of its collections. In social media posts about the event the groups also cited the AMNH’s sources of funding including the Bank of New York Mellon which houses the Friends of the Israel Defense Forces Donor Advised Fund as well as its large collection of human remains.

Ahead of the protesters’ arrival police had shut down all traffic on Central Park West and barricaded the institution’s front steps preventing the activists from entering the museum to host the planned tour. Additional police officers joined the dozens already on the scene including members of the Technical Assistance Response Unit which specialize in electronic surveillance equipment. Protest monitors from the American Civil Liberties Union stood along the edges of the crowd answering questions and surveying the scene.

Approximately 700 protesters gathered around the Manhattan institution.

A little after 2pm the activists unfurled their banners long colorful sheets of fabric bearing phrases like “resistance until return” and “from Gaza to Jenin revolution until victory.” One black banner with the words “the Nakba started here” depicted a painting of the Queens Museum building where in 1947 the United Nations voted to separate Mandate-era Palestine into two states resulting in the violent displacement of 430000 Palestinians.

Protesters held hand-painted signs and placards and a man with a cart walked through the early hours of the protest hawking small Palestinian flags for $5. One woman who asked not to be identified held swaddling cloths in her arms in a reference to the more than 6000 Palestinian children killed in Gaza since October 7.

“There is only one solution Intifada revolution” chanted the activists. “From the river to the sea; Palestine will be free.”

Some of the handmade signs and placards at the December 2 protest

Harlem-based artist and comedian Johnny Laveie wore a double-sided sign and offered fellow activists pens to write how they felt on it. By the time the protesters began marching toward Times Square every blank white space had been filled with words and phrases.

“I think as activists we often don’t have an opportunity to take care of ourselves” Lavaie told Hyperallergic. “This is our job as artists: to heal” Lavaie said. “How do we heal the activists? How do we heal and also fight for the rights of those who are oppressed?”

A little past 4pm the group walked around the block to the museum’s Gilder Center entrance on 81st Street. Police placed barricades to block access and an officer told Hyperallergic that the museum was closed to all visitors including members. However after the action on Sunday December 3 a museum spokesperson told Hyperallergic that the institution remained open during the protest and that “admission continued throughout”; the representative has not yet responded to questions about which entrances were used and how visitors were able to access them.

WOL and DTP held a similar action at AMNH exactly one week earlier on Saturday November 25 distributing flyers with specific locations inside the museum that they intended to visit on their “anti-colonial tour.” As today the organizers said that they were not allowed entry. The museum blocked off the main entrance though a spokesperson told Hyperallergic that visitors were allowed to enter through an alternate door.

AMNH has not responded to Hyperallergic’s immediate request for comment regarding today’s protest and closure.

Artist Johnny Laveie wore a sign and provided pens for fellow protesters to write how they felt.

One black banner with the words “the Nakba started here” depicted a painting of the Queens Museum building where the United Nations voted to partition the British Mandate for Palestine in 1947.

While the barricaded empty street stifled public interaction during the AMNH rally when the activists began to march drivers honked restaurant diners nodded and cheered and in a few instances observed by Hyperallergic some bystanders voiced anger and disapproval. “Return the hostages” one pedestrian yelled.

A barricaded and police-fortified Lincoln Center awaited the south-moving group but the protestors bypassed it choosing instead to enter the Columbus Circle Mall across from the southwestern corner of Central Park. Police officers and security guards attempted to close the doors but the activists pushed through.

The march moved quickly covering 40 blocks in an hour and a half. By 6pm the activists stood in the center of Time Square. Palestinian flags soared above the dense crowd illuminated by neon restaurant signs and LED billboards.

WOL organizer Abdullah Akl expressed his dismay that AMNH would not allow the group to enter the museum emphasizing that the group had made it clear that the anti-colonial tour was peaceful and comprised a teach-in.

“[The New York Police Department] would rather close multiple entrances to one of the largest museums in the United States just for the sake of a pro-Palestinian rally that’s not even actually disruptive” Akl said.

“But obviously the NYPD has no intention of our people doing that has no intention of Indigenous people continuing to learn about their history” Akl continued.

The NYPD has not responded to Hyperallergic’s immediate request for comment.

“When we come out to places like the American Museum of Natural History we make it very clear that they have not been representing Indigenous people not only in this country but countries all across the world” said Akl. “And we want to call them out on that.”

Some bystanders nodded and cheered as the march progressed.

The group marched to Times Square.

Some protesters wore a keffiyeh a garment that has become a symbol of Palestinian resistance.

Palestinian flags soared above the dense crowd illuminated by neon restaurant signs and LED billboards.

Sterling Bank of Asia (SBA) again received the Straight-Through Processing (STP) award from The Bank of New York Mellon for its exceptional payment formatting performance in 2022.

STP is a vital performance indicator in the financial industry measuring payment processing efficiency. The STP award is a testament to SBA’s fulfillment of BNY Mellon’s strict requirements for processing speed procedural compliance and secure transactions for offshore transactions.

It reflects the bank’s unwavering commitment to excellence and dedication to providing seamless and efficient financial services to its customers.

The quaint village of Saltford nestled between the bustling cities of Bristol and Bath is more than just a passing point along the A4 Bath Road. Despite its location on a key route it boasts a tight-knit community where ""everyone knows each other and feels like they belong"".

Once perceived as lacking identity Saltford has transformed into a thriving hub for families couples and young people. Over the past decade the village has embraced numerous changes evident in the 'sold' signs dotting almost every street corner. Its prime position along a busy A-road and the scenic Bristol Bath railway path make it an attractive place to settle down.

Saltford offers a diverse range of homes from luxury properties with expansive driveways and mechanical gates to charming cottages adorned with plants and flowers. It also houses hidden architectural gems like the grade II listed Saltford House believed to have been built in the 1700s by architect Thomas Bennett for his personal use.

Like any desirable location house prices in Saltford reflect its growing popularity. However data from Rightmove indicates that the overall average price of homes there was £492222 over the last year marking a 10 per cent decrease from the previous year reports Bristol Live.

According to Rightmove's records ""The majority of sales in Saltford during the last year were semi-detached properties selling for an average price of £487400. Detached properties sold for an average of £571500 with terraced properties fetching £425000.""

Saltford offers easy access to Keynsham's town centre with a mere stroll and city centres and rural pubs are just a short drive away. The public transport system is quite capable with two primary services between Bristol and Bath the X39 and 39 still running every half hour into the pre-dawn hours despite the 2023 bus cuts that affected other areas. Additionally there's the A4 an hourly airport service.

Saltford also boasts places like The Riverside Inn on the banks of the River Avon and Thai Cafe on Bath Road offering delectable meal options. Though Thai Cafe primarily serves scrumptious Thai food in the evenings it has become such an integral part of the community that it invites people in for a daytime cuppa.

During a 2022 visit Nikki the proprietor of Thai Cafe shared: ""Saltford has become the place to be. Everyone knows each other and helps each other out.""

""I have been here for about 20 years. It used to be mostly retired people who lived here but we are getting more families and young people now.""

Nikki pointing to the restaurant's interior expressed her gratitude for local support: ""People around the village have helped to make the restaurant what it is today. If something is broken someone will help and fix it.""

She continued to praise the community spirit saying ""People in the community helped me to get the restaurant up and running when we had to shut for eight months. Everyone is so nice and so helpful. That's what makes the village so great the people in it. I feel like I belong.""

Highlighting the perks of village life Nikki added ""In Saltford you have things like parking space. You don't get that in most cities. I also know that if I walk home at 10pm from work I will be safe. You don't get antisocial behaviour around here.""

Overlooking the bustling Bath Road Thai Cafe benefits from the traffic calming measures. ""Luckily traffic is slowed down because of the traffic lights"" Nikki remarked.

""We do get a lot of cars go by but people have to get to work and we understand that. Those people the people that drive through the village aren't the people that live here.""

As the warmer months roll in Saltford becomes a haven for wild swimmers kayakers and paddleboarders boasting a picturesque marina and the Bristol Avon Sailing Club making it a perfect destination for water enthusiasts.

Salford Parish Council is at the helm of addressing local concerns in the village. A spokesperson for the Parish Council shared with BristolLive their pride in the community stating: ""Many people who live and work in the village make Saltford a great place to be through their voluntary contributions which are celebrated annually through the Saltford Parish Council Community Awards. Much of the community activity is centred around Saltford Hall run by the Saltford Community Association.""

""Saltford is fortunate to have a community run Post Office and library on the A4 Bath Road as well as many active commercial businesses based around the village. Saltford is surrounded by green belt land which preserves its rural setting; care of the local environment is a matter close to many villagers' hearts as shown by the many members of the Saltford Environment Group and Saltford Wombles.""

""The village is served by the Bristol to Bath Railway Path which is popular with walkers and cyclists alike. As a rural community Saltford Parish Council welcomes considerate visitors who follow the countryside code who leave no trace of their visit by taking their litter home or use one of the many bins around the village. Saltford's residents appreciate considerate parking by visitors and use of public transport is strongly encouraged due to limited parking in the village.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzEyL3VwdG93bi1hcGFydG1lbnRzLXVudmVpbGVkLWluLXJlZGV2ZWxvcGVkLWRvd250b3duLWJhdGgtYmxvY2sv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uptown apartments unveiled in redeveloped downtown Bath block,"The Midcoast’s housing crunch eased slightly this month as developers unveiled 60 new Bath apartments geared toward senior residents.

The new apartment complex called The Uptown features 60 mostly one-bedroom apartments for tenants aged 55 and older. The apartments are for mixed-income households with rents ranging between $794 and $1495 per month. Around 42 apartments are classified as low-income according to developer The Szanton Company.

A large crowd gathered for the grand opening of the redeveloped Moses and Columbia Block Buildings on the corner of Front and Summer streets on May 8.

“There’s a housing shortage here and everywhere in Maine so the fact that we have one unit still available before we even open our doors speaks to the need for housing” said The Szanton Company Vice President Amy Cullen.

Around 10 existing units were already open in the Moses and Columbia building with Szanton adding four more units there Cullen said.

Applications for The Uptown opened in January with the apartments filling up in about one month leaving just one unit available at the time of the grand opening. The new tenants started moving into The Uptown on May 10.

“There is a housing crisis in the state and Bath is no exception” said Bath City Council Chairperson Mary Ellen Bell. “The Uptown project builds density in the downtown recreates underutilized space and provides attainable housing for some of our older residents.”

The newest addition of the building that connects to the renovated Columbia and Moses housing block sits on what used to be an empty lot that was once home to the Bath YMCA. Szanton bought the historic Moses and Columbia blocks back in 2020 with construction beginning in the summer of 2022 according to Cullen.

“The rehab of the existing historic building Moses and Columbia block that this project contains had a lot more work than we expected” Cullen said.

Most of the new tenants come from the Bath area with some coming in from out of state.

“For years to come these affordable homes are going to be a remarkable and lasting tribute to those who have worked so hard for affordable housing in this City of Ships” said MaineHousing Director Daniel Brennan.

A recent report from Deloitte Canada found only 14 per cent of near retirees can expect comfortable golden years. This study looked at Canadians aged 55 to 64 and found those who likely won’t need to rely on things like the Canada Pension Plan after 65 have more than $900000 in financial assets and likely own their home outright.

But Paul Kershaw founder of the think tank Generation Squeeze told The West Block‘s Mercedes Stephenson that the situation is even more dire for young people.

“I do increasingly worry about the pressures that they will face later on in their aspirations to retire because the reality is that for young folks today hard work doesn’t pay off like it used to” he said.

Kershaw says there are a wide range of pressures faced by younger generations that make life overall less affordable than it was for their older peers.

“They will go to post-secondary more pay more for the privilege to land jobs that actually often are paying less after adjusting for inflation. And then we all know they are facing dramatically higher housing prices that increasingly lock them out of ownership and their consolation prize is lousy rising rents” he said. “And all of that means that so much harder to save for retirement down the road.”

With a typical retirement age of 65 and average life expectancy of 81 Kershaw says that the struggle of the younger generations means more fiscal challenges for retirement programs.

Breaking news from Canada and around the world sent to your email as it happens.

“There are just three working age residents to pay for every retiree. And that’s adding some risks to what can we do to protect that security for our retired loved ones. But it’s also putting a lot of pressure on younger taxpayers” he said.

While some retirees are able to enjoy a lower cost of housing and interest rates than their millennial and Generation Z descendants Laura Tamblyn Watts CEO of CanAge argues that our current fiscal situation is hitting seniors hard too.

“Boomers are the most indebted generation we’ve ever had. Some of them are retiring with student debt let alone mortgage debt” she said on The West Block.

“So they’ve accrued a lot of debt but their money didn’t make much because interest rates were historically low. Now the cost of debt has gone up and their cost of living has gone up… So it is actually a very poor situation.”

In this situation Tamblyn Watts said that more people are having to look at extending their working years past 65.

“The idea of retirement at 65 came out of a time where people died at 67. That’s actually when we created our (Canada Pension Plan). It was only expected that you would live two years and then you would die. Now we’re looking at a third of our life” she said.

According to RBC about 14 per cent of Boomer households in Canada now carry mortgage debt.

Kershaw said that while more Boomers are carrying debt into retirement they are still economic winners.

“While there has been a little bit of a trickle-up in the number of Boomers who are retiring with mortgage debt typically that’s because they have been refinancing homes and purchasing additional homes because they are making a great deal of wealth coming from the housing system” he said.

Conversely Tamblyn Watts says that downsizing is becoming increasingly challenging for seniors.

“Most rental places are not appropriate for older people. They’re not easily able to downsize and stay in their communities” she said.

“Many of them are going to sell or are going to have to move far outside of the area that they are into something much more remote more challenging to get the services and health care that they need where transportation becomes a huge issue.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ25pdHltZW1vcmlhbC5jb20vZW4tY2Evb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jaGlsbGl3YWNrLWJjL3BhdWwtYmF4dGVyLTExNTY2MDM00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paul Baxter Obituary - Chilliwack BC,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.dignitymemorial.com/en-ca/obituaries/chilliwack-bc/paul-baxter-11566034 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ25pdHltZW1vcmlhbC5jb20vZW4tY2Evb2JpdHVhcmllcy9jaGlsbGl3YWNrLWJjL3BhdWwtYmF4dGVyLTExNTY2MDM00gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vaG9va2VtaGVhZGxpbmVzLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEyLzAyL2NqLWJheHRlci1wbGF5aW5nLWJpZy0xMi1jaGFtcGlvbnNoaXAtZ2FtZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is CJ Baxter playing in the Big 12 championship game today?

It is a sad time for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.48%) (BRK.B -0.55%) and the global investment community at large. Warren Buffett's longtime business partner Charlie Munger passed away on Nov. 28 2023 nearly a month before reaching 100 years of age.

Buffett and Munger both have expressed confidence that the investment conglomerate they helped build will be an empire built to last. Just a week prior to Munger's passing Buffett said as much in a letter outlining his annual charitable giving pledges:

Berkshire – one of the largest and most diversified companies in the world – will inevitably encounter human errors in judgment and behavior. These occur at all large organizations public or private. But these mistakes are unlikely to be serious at Berkshire and will be acknowledged and corrected. We have the right CEO to succeed me and the right Board of Directors as well. Both are needed.

And who will be that next CEO? It's Berkshire's non-insurance business head Greg Abel. And Munger's replacement will be the insurance business head Ajit Jain. And what of the empire they will inherit the reins to? Are shares of Berkshire still a long-term buy for 2024?

Berkshire an ultimate all-weather ""index fund""?

A year ago after an epic rise in Berkshire Hathaway stock I said shares of Buffett's conglomerate remained a great long-term buy but maybe not a ""best buy now."" Berkshire stock rose but slightly lagged behind the rally in the S&P 500 index and especially underperformed the Nasdaq Composite index since then.

But there's a simple explanation for this: Berkshire is a steadier long-term investment especially compared to the tech-heavy Nasdaq and even to the increasingly tech-heavy S&P 500 (owing to the massive size of companies like Apple Microsoft and Amazon that make up a large portion of the index's composition).

That's because outside of Berkshire Hathaway's holdings in publicly traded stocks (dominated by Apple which makes up nearly 50% of this portfolio) the company wholly owns myriad ""old and boring"" but highly profitable businesses.

Included in those are insurance underwriting and investment income from those insurance company holdings (like GEICO part of Abel's oversight). The insurance business's operating income through the first nine months of 2023 rallied 165% from depressed levels last year to $11.4 billion. Railroads (BNSF acquired in 2008) utilities (including extensive natural gas pipelines) the newly purchased majority stake in the Pilot Travel Center business as well as numerous manufacturing and retail companies (collectively Jain's half of the Berkshire empire) are also having a solid year. In all Berkshire's wholly owned subsidiaries' operating income was up 19% so far in 2023 to $28.9 billion.

Thus the giant that Buffett and Munger helped build is a great all-weather investment for good times and bad. Berkshire's stock performance in 2023 though slightly trailing the rebound from the 2022 bear market for the major stock indexes is solid for a year where there has been frequent mention of recession risk. Berkshire is itself a type of index of great companies that can steadily perform no matter the economic climate of the moment.

Berkshire Hathaway a best buy before the end of 2023?

As it was this time a year ago Berkshire Hathaway's price-to-book value (a metric Buffett and Munger have often used over the years to determine how much stock to repurchase) remains near its historic highs. This keeps me from calling it a best buy headed into 2024.

But Berkshire need not be dirt cheap to be a great buy. Regardless of that price-to-book value shares have tended to steadily grind higher over the long term.

After a solid rally in 2023 the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes could have bumps in the road ahead. Berkshire stock could as well. Nevertheless this company is built to last and proven leadership with great investment acumen (Abel and Jain) have been installed to keep things moving in the right direction. If you're looking for a great stock you can buy and forget Berkshire Hathaway remains a top pick as a core portfolio holding.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vYXdlYWx0aG9mY29tbW9uc2Vuc2UuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bC1pbnZlc3RpbmctaXMtaGFyZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Successful Investing is Hard,"After Charlie Munger passed away this week I went looking through an old post I wrote about his investing principles from a decade ago.

There was a table I recreated that showed the annual returns from the Munger Partnership which was the fund he ran before joining Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway for good:

The results are spectacular but look at how volatile his returns were. Munger was down more than 53% during the 1973-1974 bear market.

The losses didn’t matter of course because the gains more than made up for them.

The same dynamic applies to Berkshire Hathaway.

Munger joined Buffett full-time at the former textile company-turned-investment-arm in 1978. Since then Berkshire Hathaway has compounded capital at nearly 19% per year an incredible return.

But there were plenty of drawdowns along the way to those unbelievable returns:

Over the past 40+ years Berkshire Hathaway has experienced drawdowns of -20% -32% -34% -46% -51% -22% and -25%. That’s plenty of bear markets and crashes.

Which brings us to one of my favorite Munger quotes:

If you’re not willing to react with equanimity to a market price decline of 50% two or three times a century you’re not fit to be a common shareholder and you deserve the mediocre result you’re going to get compared to the people who do have the temperament who can be more philosophical about these market fluctuations.

Of course being more philosophical about market fluctuations is not easy.

Losing money is no fun. Making money is hard. Investing is HARD.

It can be grueling for mere mortals like you and I but it’s even hard for legends like Munger and Buffett.

A few weeks ago I listened to one of Munger’s final interviews on The Acquired Podcast.

Even at 99 years old he was still cagey and sharp.

The overarching theme of Munger’s message in this interview was how difficult it was to produce such an enviable track record.

I loved his answer when asked if Buffett and Munger could replicate Berkshire Hathaway’s success if both we in their 30s starting out today:

The answer to that is no we wouldn’t. We had… everybody that had unusually good results… almost everything has three things: They’re very intelligent they worked very hard and they were very lucky. It takes all three to get them on this list of the super successful. How can you arrange to have just […] good luck? The answer is you can start early and keep trying for a long time and maybe you’ll get one or two.

Refreshingly humble.

Munger mentioned how hard it is to achieve investment success on multiple occasions:

Why shouldn’t it be hard to make money? Why should it be easy?

It was never easy. It’s thoroughly understood it was never easy and it’s harder now. Those are the two. But it takes time.

I knew when I was 70 that it was hard. It’s just so hard. I know how hard it is now. Always people who are getting this 2 and 20 or 3 and 30 or whatever they all talk because oh it was easy. And they get to believing their own bullshit. And of course it’s not very easy. It’s very hard.

I love it.

There are so many successful people today who try to make it seem like it should be easy to replicate their success.

If you just follow these 10 simple steps or read this one book or live by these inspirational quotes blah blah blah.

Finding success can be simple but it’s never easy.

It’s even harder to recreate the success of someone else considering how much luck is involved in the process.

I’ll leave you with a Munger quote from Damn Right by Janet Lowe:

Each person has to play the game given his own marginal utility considerations and in a way that takes into account his own psychology. If losses are going to make you miserable – and some losses are inevitable – you might be wise to utilize a very conservative patterns of investment and saving all your life. So you have to adapt your strategy to your own nature and your own talents. I don’t think there’s a one-size-fits-all investment strategy that I can give you.

Amen.

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has claimed that the Haslam family tried to bribe executives at the Pilot truck stop chain. In a counter-lawsuit Berkshire also alleges that the Haslams paid millions of dollars to inflate the company's profits this year.

If successful the Haslams could potentially force Berkshire to pay more for their remaining 20% stake in the company which is valued at around $3.2 billion. Berkshire recently became the majority owner of the company earlier this year.

The Haslam family which includes Cleveland Browns managing partner Jimmie Haslam and former Tennessee governor Bill Haslam had initially sued Berkshire Hathaway for allegedly attempting to understate Pilot's earnings this year by changing its accounting practices.

According to the Associated Press Berkshire claims that ""Jimmy Haslam offered to personally pay bonuses to the executives that would far exceed their annual salaries based on the price the family received for its remaining stake.""

The offer was reportedly made at a country club dinner in Knoxville Tennessee in March and was repeated to at least four other high-level executives. The former CEO of Pilot also extended the offer to at least 10 other executives in April according to Berkshire's filing.

""Those are wild inventions"" say the lawyers

In response to these allegations attorney for the Haslam family Anitha Reddy stated ""We called Berkshire's allegations wild inventions in our opposition brief. I don't think we could have been clearer that we dispute them. And if there is any doubt in Berkshire's mind we think they're false and we intend to defeat them on whatever schedule the court orders.""

The original lawsuit is scheduled to take place sometime in January. Both parties will have the opportunity to present their arguments and evidence before a decision is made.

This case has attracted significant attention due to the involvement of high-profile individuals and the large sums of money at stake. The accusations of bribery and financial manipulation have serious implications for both the Haslam family and Berkshire Hathaway. It remains to be seen how this legal battle will unfold and what impact it will have on the future of the Pilot truck stop chain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hc2RhcS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvc3VycHJpc2Utd2FycmVuLWJ1ZmZldHQtaGFzLWJldC1vdmVyLSUyNDE3Ni1iaWxsaW9uLWluLTMtYXJ0aWZpY2lhbC1pbnRlbGxpZ2VuY2UtYWktZ3Jvd3Ro0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Surprise! Warren Buffett Has Bet Over $176 Billion in 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks,"Over the years Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett has made no bones about his difficulty understanding some of the world's latest technological innovations. The legendary investor had for years avoided technology stocks saying he prefers ""simple businesses"" stating categorically ""If there's lots of technology we won't understand it.""

Despite those assertions over the past few years Buffett has accumulated a fortune in stocks on the cutting edge of artificial intelligence (AI).

1. Apple -- $174 billion

Anyone who has followed Berkshire Hathaway won't be surprised to find that the company's most sizable AI stock holding is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). When including the shares held by subsidiary New England Asset Management (NEAM) Buffett's stake in Apple amounts to more than 915 million shares worth roughly $174 billion.

Apple has long been at the forefront of AI technology. The company integrated its virtual digital assistant Siri into the iPhone 4S in 2011. That was the first of a long line of AI-driven features infused into the iPhone supported by the Apple Neural Engine. This sophisticated neural processing unit (NPU) resides on the device supporting all manner of AI functionality.

This includes the Face ID technology used to unlock the iPhone the language recognition and processing that helps Siri better interact with users over time and the image processor that helps improve photo quality in the camera. Many of Apple's health and safety features are also supported by AI including the Apple Watch's fall detection crash detection and electrocardiogram (ECG) functionality.

While Apple has kept its generative AI aspirations close to the vest CEO Tim Cook said on the company's third-quarterearnings call ""We view AI and machine learning as core fundamental technologies that are integral to virtually every product that we build."" He went on to say ""We've been doing research across a wide range of AI technologies including generative AI for years.""

Apple has published a number of job postings this year for those with expertise in the field of generative AI. The company's history suggests Apple won't reveal its plans for using this technology until it's already deeply embedded in an as-yet-to-be-released product.

2. Amazon -- $1.47 billion

Berkshire Hathaway also holds a considerable stake in e-commerce denizen Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) though Buffett himself didn't initiate the purchase. The company holds 10 million shares currently valued at nearly $1.47 billion.

Buffett said he's long been a fan and ""always admired Jeff [Bezos]"" Amazon's former CEO. In his usual self-deprecating manner however Buffett also admitted he should have invested in the company long ago but didn't because ""If I think something is going to be a miracle I tend not to bet on it.""

Amazon is a longtime innovator in the field of AI. The company has developed algorithms to recommend products forecast demand operate its fulfillment and logistics warehouses and map out product delivery routes. The company also offers machine learning and generative AI tools via its industry-leading Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure service.

Amazon also pioneered an array of products infused with Alexa its AI-driven virtual assistant. CEO Andy Jassy recently admitted the company is ""investing heavily"" in the large language models that form the foundation for generative AI.

3. Snowflake -- $1.05 billion

Data cloud and analytics provider Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) is the last in Berkshire's trio of sizable AI holdings. In fact Berkshire invested in the company even before its initial public offering (IPO) in a move instigated by Buffett lieutenant Todd Combs who purchased more than 6 million shares currently valued at roughly $1.05 billion. Combs is also CEO of wholly owned Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary GEICO which is a longtime customer of Snowflake's data warehouse services.

According to Snowflake its platform was ""built from the ground up to support machine learning and AI-driven data science applications."" The company also says it helps businesses ""apply AI to make better decisions improve productivity and reach more customers."" Most recently Snowflake added support for the large language models that underpin the major generative AI systems. This allows users to deploy these systems directly within their Snowflake accounts.

Is it time to buy?

Buffett hasn't minced words about his love of Apple stock. At Berkshire's 2023 shareholder meeting in May he said ""[Apple] just happens to be a better business than any we own."" The iPhone continues to gain converts controlling an estimated 60% share of the premium smartphone market for the second consecutive quarter according to data compiled by Counterpoint Research. Add to that the company's consistent services growth and superior cash-flow generation and it's easy to see why Apple is a Buffett favorite. Furthermore at just 31 times earnings Apple is selling at a discount to its historical valuation.

While Amazon experienced a fall from grace during the downturn the company has seen its e-commerce business rebound. And despite last year's challenges the company continued to control roughly 38% of the market in the U.S. more than the next 14 rivals combined. It's also the acknowledged leader of cloud infrastructure services though competition continues to ramp up. Finally it's the world's No. 3 provider of digital advertising services behind just Alphabet's Google and Meta Platforms. And at just 2 times forward sales Amazon is the cheapest of the bunch.

The riskiest of the three is Snowflake as evidenced by its precipitous fall last year. While demand for the company's data storage and analytics services continues to grow economic uncertainty has weighed on its recovery. Furthermore the stock is still pretty pricey selling for 16 times forward sales. However for those with a stomach for volatility and a willingness to accept some additional risk for greater potential gains Snowflake might be worth considering.

Inc. (NYSE:BBY) Now?,"Let's talk about the popular Best Buy Co. Inc. (NYSE:BBY). The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NYSE over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Best Buy’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity.

See our latest analysis for Best Buy

What Is Best Buy Worth?

Great news for investors – Best Buy is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation the intrinsic value for the stock is $118.02 but it is currently trading at US$73.42 on the share market meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However given that Best Buy’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta which is a good indicator for share price volatility.

Can we expect growth from Best Buy?

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Best Buy's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows feeding into a higher share value.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? Since BBY is currently undervalued it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However there are also other factors such as financial health to consider which could explain the current undervaluation.

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on BBY for a while now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet which means it’s not too late to buy BBY. But before you make any investment decisions consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet in order to make a well-informed buy.

In light of this if you'd like to do more analysis on the company it's vital to be informed of the risks involved. At Simply Wall St we found 1 warning sign for Best Buy and we think they deserve your attention.

This case originally retailed for $400 but today it's available for $200 from Best Buy. That's an excellent deal for a well-reviewed SFF PC case that also includes a 140mm AiO a 92mm fan a PCIe 4.0 riser cable and a 750W SFX power supply.

The NZXT H1 is available in two versions and this appears to be the V2 model. That means it comes with a higher wattage power supply (750W vs 650W) an extra fan and slightly larger dimensions to allow for bigger graphics cards to be fitted.

It's this version that I built a computer in last year and I found it quite straightforward. The front glass and rear mesh panels pop off with a tug then the remaining bodywork (including the two mesh side panels and the top) slides up and off the chassis. This allows easy access to all components.

As the PSU and AiO are pre-installed for you most of the more fiddly cables are already in position - so you just need to prepare your Mini ITX motherboard with your RAM NVMe storage and CPU then you can plop it into position screw on the AiO cooler (with pre-applied thermal paste) and plug in a few items like the power button front I/O and motherboard/CPU power inputs. From there you need to attach the riser cable into your motherboard slot your graphics card into the riser and secure it with some screws.

In terms of compatibility GPUs up to 324mm long and 58mm thick are supported while memory can be up to 46mm tall - so you can fit in quite substantial graphics cards but something truly giant like the triple-slot RTX 4090 Founders Edition is slightly too thick.

In any case it's a nice case to build in that looks nice when finished and doesn't do too badly in thermals either so if you're considering a SFF PC build I'd say this is a solid starting point at $200!"

The running shoe world is always abuzz with the arrival of a new contender and the R.A.D. R-1 could be about to make waves since its debut this year. Emerging from the realms of CrossFit-centric footwear R.A.D. takes its first strides into the running shoe arena with the R-1.



After reading the specs for the R-1 and getting my first glimpse of the shoe it was clear R.A.D had three things in mind: sustainability design and comfort.

The main standout feature of this running shoe is the midsole. The R-1s midsole is powered by R.A.D.'s groundbreaking SwellFoam N2 technology. Comprising a 50/50 blend of cane and fossil composition it marks a 20% bio increase from the R.A.D One training shoe's SwellFoam. This unique foam mix is designed to deliver next level cushioning for your long runs. The midsole also incorporates something called Bubble-tech which is composed of nitrogen bubbles for a lightweight midsole and noticeable energy return. But how did these innovative features fare up when I put the shoes to the test?



While trying to build up my base levels again before beginning marathon training I tested the R.A.D R-1s during a variety of runs including interval work one tempo session two long runs and various easy miles. Read my full R.A.D R-1 running shoe review below and see how they compare to the best running shoes.

R.A.D R-1 review: Price and availability

Retailing at $160/£150 R.A.Ds first running shoe can be bought in a Men's size 4.5 to 14 and a Women's 6 to 15.5. With 11 colorways to choose from ranging from the understated Black to the vibrant FTC Red the R-1 is set to cater to diverse tastes.

R.A.D. suggests that this shoe fits true to size but to size up by 0.5 if you usually do in running shoes. But If you’re ever unsure about sizing read our how to buy running shoes guide here. At the time of writing you can only buy the R-1 running shoes from the R.A.D website we will update here if they become available through other retailers.

R.A.D R-1 review: Design and fit

Let's start with the basics. I opted for my usual size during testing and found the fit to be spot-on supporting the idea that true-to-size is the way to go with the R-1.



If you were to tell me that a brand best known for CrossFit shoes is planning to create a running shoe the R-1 is exactly what I'd envision. That may sound silly but the R-1's are not as extravagant looking as some popular running shoes appear (like the On Cloudmonsters) and are subtle enough in appearance to pass as a training shoe in the gym. However the chunky and rounded sole does give the game away that they are in fact designed for running.



SwellFoam N2 is R.A.D's answer to a cutting-edge midsole tech for running shoes that incorporates sugar cane actively capturing carbon during growth reducing reliance on less eco-friendly materials. With a 50/50 cane/fossil composition blend it marks a 20% bio increase from the R.A.D One training shoe's SwellFoam.

Upper

The upper is crafted from a visually intriguing 3D looking mesh featuring horizontal lines that I felt enhanced both structure and breathability. Around the toe heel and lateral sections of the shoe there is a TPU film strategically placed to help with durability in areas where wear and tear is more common.

The entrance to the shoe features a soft foam enveloping the ankle and foot and ensuring a comfortable fit. There is also a little additional cushioning in the heel cup area which helped prevent any unwanted foot movement during testing. The tongue is gusseted and made from an airy mesh material which provides cushioning and allows for a snug fit without causing discomfort. However the Achilles heel of the design lies in the laces which I found frequently came undone mid-run and got a bit annoying during my tempo and interval training runs when pausing to retie my laces wasn't on the agenda.

Midsole:

The heart of the R-1 lies in its midsole as we've already touched on it's powered by R.A.D.'s proprietary SwellFoam N2 technology. This supercritical foam midsole not only should deliver cushioning for long runs but is also supposed to exhibit the necessary responsiveness for tempo and interval sessions. Plus the use of nitrogen bubbles in the foaming process is designed to create a lighter-weight midsole with enhanced energy return. While I definitely enjoyed the soft cushioned feel of the shoe on my easy and long runs I'm afraid I can't say the same for any runs where I needed to pick up the pace.



I tried finishing a speedy-ish 5K in my first two runs with the shoes and felt I was working harder than I have to when I wear my On Cloudmonsters or go-to Parkrun shoe the Hoka Kawana. It was a similar story when I came to wear the R-1's during a tempo session or for interval training. I felt like I was stomping my way along rather than bouncing seamlessly from one foot to another. However I did feel really comfortable in the R-1's during my long runs and will be returning to them for long casual chatty runs in the future.

Outsole:

The outsole is relatively simple in its design with four rubber pieces. Two weeks into testing the R-1's and as expected so soon on no sign of wear was evident. However once these sections do begin to wear away you'll find yourself running directly on the midsole. That being said it reminds me of the bottom of the Hoka Rincon and they seem to hold up just fine from what I've heard from fellow runners.

R.A.D R-1 Run Performance:

Initial impressions during speed sessions and interval runs did leave me questioning the R-1's prowess. It seemed to demand more effort to maintain pace than some competitors. However as my testing progressed into longer runs and easy miles the shoe's potential began to shine for me in the form of reliable cushioning.

The upper provided excellent lockdown and ventilation. I have only tested these shoes in winter conditions but I'm holding out for the R-1s to become a trusty long distance running shoe in summer with its breathable upper.

The R-1 ended up being a comfortable plush option for easy miles and extended outings. However it lacks the specialized features necessary for speed and tempo runs. While not designed as a performance powerhouse it serves well for casual runs or those seeking a comfortable companion for lengthy excursions.

R.AD R-1 review: Verdict

For runners seeking a plush comfortable experience on easy miles and extended outings the R-1 is a solid choice. Casual runners and those prioritizing comfort over speed will find a reliable companion in these shoes. With that being said this is quite a pricy shoe. Had I found design features like the Bubble Tech to have delivered greater energy return or the Swellfoam to provide more bounce I definitely would be more in favor of the price.

The R.A.D. R-1 earns its stripes as a casual running shoe but sadly doesn't stand out as a solid shoe choice for energy return or bounce. I'm excited to see where R.A.D goes with running wear now that it has entered the scene.

If you're looking for a reliable everyday running shoe for a slightly smaller price you should check out the Nike Pegasus 40. Or if you want to find a snappy and responsive shoe you might like the Adidas Ultraboost Light.",,,,,,,,,

The government of the UAE at the Dubai-hosted COP28 climate conference announced the launch of ALTÉRRA a new investment platform aimed at driving private capital towards climate investments and on improving access to climate finance in emerging markets with a particular focus on the Global South.

Her screams were an intended element of the illusion but nerves and fear made them genuine that time.

For Ms. Blackstone that gig assisting the master illusionist Harry Blackstone Jr. turned into a love affair and later marriage. After her husband died in 1997 Ms. Blackstone moved center stage and went on to a successful career as an illusionist coach producer and director.

But she is an exception. Only around 8 percent of professional magicians are women according to a spokeswoman for the Magic Castle a private clubhouse in Los Angeles for members of the Academy of Magical Arts. Ms. Blackstone and others say a number of factors are to blame for the stubborn disparity including sexism wardrobe limitations and the enduring stereotype that women best serve as the audience’s distraction.

“I think for many years no one really thought of the need for women to be the magician” Ms. Blackstone said. “But now as we’re coming up with different roles and different things we want to be doing then there’s no reason why women can’t be just as great as men.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9pbnRlcm5hdGlvbmFsLWJ1c2luZXNzL2Jyb29rZmllbGQtYmxhY2tzdG9uZS1hbW9uZy1sYW5kbG9yZHMtaGFuZGluZy1iYWNrLWtleXMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvMTA1Njg5ODg3LmNtc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Brookfield Blackstone among landlords handing back keys,"Office landlords hit hard by the work-from-home revolution are resorting to a desperate measure in the real estate world: ""handing back the keys."" When this happens the landlord stops paying the mortgage on the office building or declines to refinance it. The bank or investors who made the loan then repossess the building.Some of the biggest names in commercial real estate  like Brookfield and Blackstone  have defaulted on mortgages and have started or completed the process of handing back the keys on office towers.The tactic reveals both the depth of the problems in the office market and the ability of big property companies to push much of the financial pain onto others - in this case banks and other lenders.Since the pandemic began office employees showed they could get their jobs done from home and many have been reluctant to come back. And companies realized they could save a lot of money by renting less office space making many office towers unprofitable for their owners and turning many business districts into ghost towns. About 23% of office space in the United States was vacant or available for sublet at the end of November according to Avison Young  a real estate services firm compared with 16% before the pandemic.Handing back the keys is a drastic move but it makes sense because it can limit a landlord's losses on a building. Take a property company that bought an office tower for $100 million just before the pandemic investing $25 million of its own money and borrowing $75 million. If the building is hemorrhaging tenants and now has a value of $45 million the landlord's initial investment could be worth zero - and the lower rent income may not be enough to cover the building's costs.Rather than continue to pay interest and other expenses the landlord can decide to default which means the lenders get the beleaguered building. And in theory the lenders could end up with a $30 million loss - the difference between the amount they lent ($75m) and the resale value of the building ($45 million).Today's handing back the keys is reminiscent of the term ""jingle mail"" which became notorious after the financial crisis of 2008 when homeowners abandoned their homes - and supposedly sent their keys back to their banks - because their homes were worth far less than what they owed on the mortgage.But there is a difference: Big property firms can keep doing business after they default and are even considered savvy for jettisoning distressed buildings.

Boeing on Friday announced its elimination from the competition known as the Survivable Airborne Operations Center to develop the aircraft that would serve as flying emergency command and control post in emergencies such as if nuclear war breaks out.

Reuters first reported the news. Boeing is the manufacturer of the current ""Doomsday plane"" known as the E-4B Nightwatch – a militarized version of a Boeing 747 that’s capable of aerial refueling with advanced electronics and communications systems designed to shield against electromagnetic pulses and other effects stemming from nuclear war.

""We are approaching all new contract opportunities with added discipline to ensure we can meet our commitments and support the long-term health of our business"" a Boeing spokesperson told FOX Business. ""We remain confident our SAOC approach is the most comprehensive technically mature and lowest-risk solution for the customer and Boeing.""

""Our proposal is based on 60 years of military commercial derivative aircraft knowledge and experience including the design development and sustainment of the E-4B Nightwatch which currently serves the national security command and control mission"" the spokesperson added.

Boeing’s removal from the SAOC competition leaves just one publicly known company in the running – privately held defense contractor Sierra Nevada Corp. The Air Force plans to award an SAOC contract in 2024 and has declined to comment on whether other firms have submitted bids.

Such programs have resulted in $16.3 billion in losses since 2014 on fixed-price defense programs according to a Reuters review of Boeing’s regulatory filings.

Boeing Chief Financial Officer Brian West indicated in October that the company is looking to move away from fixed-price contracts saying ""Rest assured we haven’t signed any fixed-price development contracts nor (do we) intend to.""

And some of the world’s biggest companies are planning to use this data to decarbonize their supply chains.

Climate TRACE uses machine learning satellites and other technology to detect and track greenhouse gas emissions. That information is then bundled up into a public inventory the latest of which was announced this weekend by Gore at the COP28 climate talks in Dubai. The database covers more than 350 million sources of greenhouse gas pollution such as individual power plants steel mills and mining operations. That level of specificity allows companies to build a low-emissions supply chain rather than relying on suppliers’ self-reported emissions data said Gavin McCormick co-founding member of the coalition.

“We are here at this COP in particular because this is the year of the Global Stocktake” Gore said referring to the process to gauge countries’ progress toward meeting the Paris Agreement goals. “Climate TRACE is really the only independent comprehensive source of accurate data on which a stocktake can be made.”

Not ‘the climate police’

Companies that have newly signed on to use Climate TRACE’s data to gather more information on steel and aluminum supplier emissions include Tesla Boeing and General Motors. Some companies using the inventory have already told McCormick they’re finding cleaner manufacturing facilities that offer similar prices to their current suppliers and have the capacity to handle new customers though he didn’t name them specifically.

Working with companies on steel and aluminum supplier emissions is just an initial “proof of concept” McCormick said. The coalition — which includes data scientists AI researchers and nongovernmental organizations — plans to expand its partnerships next year to include exploring emissions reduction potential within lumber rice cement and beef suppliers. Climate TRACE also has designs to include air pollution in its inventory and publish inventories at a monthly or even weekly place. While the group doesn’t want to be “the climate police” McCormick said it’s open to working with governments interested in levying tariffs to goods from polluting facilities.

Machine learning models can process massive amounts of emissions data but they also risk missing extreme sources of emissions or “infrequent but very consequential events” like methane plumes according to Mallory Barnes an assistant professor at Indiana University’s School of Public and Environmental Affairs and a member of NASA’s Carbon Monitoring System.

To help account for those outliers Climate TRACE provides confidence and uncertainty estimates for every asset in its database McCormick said. Sectors in which those infrequent events are a large percentage of their emissions receive high uncertainty and low confidence ratings.

‘Measure and report’

Beyond detailing individual facility emissions this inventory release — Climate TRACE’s third since it launched in 2020 — also reveals larger country-level insights. One of the most damning: The host country of this year’s climate conference the United Arab Emirates may have underestimated its own emissions by over 100 million tons a discrepancy which McCormick partly ascribes to underreporting by the oil and gas sector. The country’s latest 2019 numbers were 225 million tons while Climate TRACE put the figure at over 350 million tons. (Both figures excluding aviation and maritime shipping which the UNFCCC doesn’t require countries to include in national totals.)

“They have no explanation for the discrepancy” Gore said. “A stocktake has to be a truthful stocktake and they have simply ignored lots of emissions that we can measure and report.”

Moreover the UAE’s figure is growing: The coalition puts the country’s emissions today at close to 400 million tons.

“What [it] looks like is going on is that a lot of countries are kind of measuring the stuff they know about and assuming the rest is zero” McCormick said noting that’s simply not the case.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vc2VlLWNhYmluLWRlc2lnbmVkLWZvci1iYmotNzc3eC0yMDIzLTEy0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnVzaW5lc3NpbnNpZGVyLmNvbS9zZWUtY2FiaW4tZGVzaWduZWQtZm9yLWJiai03Nzd4LTIwMjMtMTI_YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,See the cabin designed for $400 million+ BBJ 777X,"Lufthansa Technik unveiled a cabin design for Boeing's newest business jet.

Cybersecurity researchers have warned people about a new scam that is targeting Booking .com customers by posting advertisements on the Dark Web asking for help finding victims. Hackers are targeting accommodation listed on the platform to impersonate staff members.The scam investigated by cyber-security firm Secureworks involved deployment of the Vidar infostealer to steal a hotel's Booking.com credentials.Access to the Booking.com management portal allows the threat actor to see upcoming bookings and directly message guests according to cybersecurity firm Secureworks.Booking.com has not been hacked but hackers have devised ways to get into the administration portals of individual hotels which use the service.Hackers are offering $30 to $2000 per valid log with additional incentives for regular suppliers.According to reports hackers appear to be making so much money in their attacks that they are now offering to pay thousands to criminals who share access to hotel portals.A Booking.com spokesperson said that the company is aware that some of its accommodation partners are being targeted by hackers ""using a host of known cyber-fraud tactics"" reports the BBC.Secureworks incident responders noted that the threat actor initiated contact by emailing a member of the hotel's operations staff.""The sender claimed to be a former guest who had lost an identification document (ID) and they requested the recipient's assistance in finding it. The email did not include an attachment or malicious links and it was likely intended to gain the recipient's trust"" the security team noted.With no reason to be suspicious the employee responded to the email and requested additional information to assist the sender.Later the threat actor sent another email about the lost ID. The sender identified the document as a passport and stated that they strongly believed they left it at the hotel.When the recipient clicked the link in the email a ZIP archive file was downloaded to the computer's desktop.""Microsoft Defender identified a file within this archive as the Vidar infostealer. Microsoft Defender detected multiple failed execution attempts before the malware finally executed"" the researchers informed.Secureworks researchers analysed the contents of this file and confirmed that it is the Vidar infostealer. This Vidar sample is configured to only steal passwords.""This activity originally appeared to suggest that Booking.com's systems were compromised. However the observations by Secureworks incident responders indicate that threat actors likely stole credentials to the admin.booking. com property management portal directly from the properties and used the access to target the properties' customers"" the team said.--IANSna/dpb",,,,,,,,,

Investors often bought homes in cash winning bids over prospective homeowners needing mortgages and disproportionately driving up rent prices and forcing out tenants in areas such as East Boston with high proportions of low-income families of color the report found.

One in five homes sold in Greater Boston from 2004 to 2018 went to private investors — particularly smaller local operators scooping up two-families and triple-deckers in hopes of making a profit on the region’s soaring housing market — driving up the cost of once relatively affordable housing a new report found.

“A lot of investors are looking at hot markets and saying ‘I can get a building from an elderly owner and because the tenants are sometimes paying below market rent jack up the rent by an enormous amount slap on a little paint’ and all of a sudden they’re renting to a completely different clientele than has usually lived in that neighborhood” said Marc Draisen the council’s executive director. “That’s what often fuels displacement in these communities.”

The council defined private investors as those who used limited liability corporations purchased more than three residential properties in five years spent at least $3.45 million over 23 years or purchased properties with at least four units.

The report revealed that investors play a much bigger role in shaping the region’s housing market than previously known although Greater Boston has not seen the same level of billion-dollar corporations snatching up cheap single-family homes as other US cities.

Investors who often either flipped homes for much higher prices within two years or jacked up rents by as much as 70 percent were particularly active in some lower-income areas and gentrifying neighborhoods the report said. Parts of East Boston and Lynn for example saw more than 40 percent of home sales go to investors.

The report illuminated a dynamic that tenant and neighborhood advocates have been witnessing on the ground for decades.

“The consequences are dire” said Carolyn Chou director of Homes for All Massachusetts a tenant advocacy group. “When people I work with hear their landlord is selling the building everyone’s stomach drops. Even people with professional jobs. Because they know that pretty soon they might not have a home anymore.”

There are generally only a few outcomes when a private investor purchases a two- or three-family property advocates said.

In many cases an investor will “flip” the property meaning they put money into some simple repairs then put the property back on the market within two years for significantly more than the purchase price. Some 9 percent of homes purchased in Greater Boston between 2002 and 2022 were flipped.

In other cases investors hold onto the property and raise the rents.

Housing has been a hot bed for investment for decades largely because the nation’s shortage of homes means that properties are likely to steadily increase in value after they’re purchased particularly in housing-starved urban areas.

Most research into the impact of investor buying has focused on the activity of large-scale institutional buyers such as Invitation Homes that have taken to buying up single-family homes or apartment buildings in fast-growing regions such as Atlanta and Phoenix. Oftentimes those investors will fix up deteriorating properties and rent them out at higher rates or put them back on the market.

That sort of investor is not nearly as present in Greater Boston as it is in some other areas according to the report largely because single-family homes here are so expensive and because there are relatively few of them to buy.

Instead the report found Greater Boston has many more small and midsize investors people who own between three and five properties or who purchased between $3.45 million and $10.34 million worth of property in the 23-year period MAPC studied.

Combined those small and midsize investors made roughly 88000 purchases in that period accounting for 64 percent of all investor purchases in the region. (Institutional investors accounted for roughly 25 percent of investor purchases.)

The report found that overwhelmingly investors are eyeing two- and three-family homes the kind of buildings that represent the region’s last remaining “naturally occurring affordable housing.” That deeply concerns affordable housing advocates.

In most cases two-families and triple-deckers were built decades sometimes a century ago. Because of their age and sometimes their condition those properties tend to carry cheaper rents and purchase prices. In low-income neighborhoods areas hit hardest by America’s long history of racist mortgage lending policies and historical disinvestment these properties tend to be last refuges of affordability in a city and region that is rapidly growing too expensive for people of modest means to stay housing advocates say.

Those buildings have long been a bastion for Boston’s working and middle classes who have often purchased small multifamily properties as homes and rented out the other units for supplemental income or to relatives. But now the report said such opportunities are growing increasingly out of reach as investors snap up the properties with cash offers.

“That model of homes and homeownership that the triple-decker represents which was so important to this region for so long... it’s not evaporating but people are being out-competed for those things” said Timothy Reardon chief of data and research for the state’s new Executive Office of Housing and Livable Communities. “We’ve seen that the effects of that can be devastating.”

In 2018 two-families represented more than 30 percent of investor acquisitions and three-families nearly 50 percent. Those figures were even higher in low-income neighborhoods and the state’s inner cities and picked up in the years after the 2008 financial crisis when home prices dropped and foreclosures were widespread.

Investor activity in the housing market has historically been challenging to document because most purchasers buy property through one or more LLCs making it difficult to discern who is behind a transaction. The data took MAPC roughly four years to analyze.

Even more challenging though will be figuring out how to pump the brakes on the trend said Draisen. A real estate transfer tax could help he said because it could discourage speculators from buying and selling homes in quick succession. And it would provide funding for more affordable housing efforts.

The state should also require more transparency around LLCs he said because knowing who is behind purchases will make it easier to understand how many buildings private investors are purchasing and where.

“We need policies that will put a stop to this” Chou of of Homes for All Massachusetts said.

Following the death of George Floyd Lee Pelton’s essay “America Is on Fire” went viral. But for his latest mission—fixing the city’s shameful racial wealth gap—the recently installed president of the Boston Foundation knows it’ll take a lot more than words.

Get a compelling long read and must-have lifestyle tips in your inbox every Sunday morning — great with coffee!

Lee Pelton cannot see. It’s a Friday morning in early October and harsh stage lighting is temporarily blinding the Boston Foundation president and CEO during a panel discussion at the Mass Black Expo. Hundreds of entrepreneurs investors nonprofit leaders and public officials have descended on the carpeted sprawl of the Boston Convention & Exhibition Center in the Seaport many of whom are packed inside this particular conference room to hear Pelton speak directly to the weekend’s theme “Building Black Wealth in the Commonwealth.”

Squinting through tortoiseshell specs Pelton can only guess at the number of people before him. He feels a bit awkward. It’s not stage fright; the former Emerson College president is a natural orator. (Even former Governor Charlie Baker once bemoaned having to follow him during a speaking engagement.) But Pelton likes to play off the energy and reactions of his audience—an audience that at this moment is basically invisible to him. What’s more the whole event is behind schedule. The opening ceremony with speeches from Governor Maura Healey Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll and Black Economic Council of Massachusetts (BECMA) president and CEO Nicole Obi ran long.

Still Pelton doesn’t let himself get flustered. After all he has important things to talk about. “I’m cool” Pelton tells the crowd referring to the stage lights. The soft-spoken stylish and erudite fixture of Boston society couldn’t have said it any more succinctly: Lee Pelton is cool.

Make no mistake though: Pelton’s elegant duds and outward ease belie the fire that burns beneath his exterior. It is a fire of indignation over racial inequities—Boston’s most pressing and intractable issue—that is fueling him to refocus his own priorities.

After speeding through a sweeping overview of Black Boston’s history from the transatlantic slave trade to its current cultural mosaic and answering questions about the evolution of Black wealth and economic disparities in Boston he launches into what has become his life’s focus since leaving higher education: closing the racial wealth gap.

By now the numbers are infamous but bear repeating: In 2015 a Federal Reserve Bank of Boston report called “The Color of Wealth in Boston” found that the median net worth of a non-immigrant Black family in this city was $8 compared to $247500 for a white family. The sample size in the report was quite small—fewer than 100 Black families were surveyed—but the impact of the study across Boston was enormous spurring many efforts to address racial inequities.

Some people including attendees at the convention have emphasized increasing access to business capital and employment to fix the problem. But Pelton is here today to deliver a different message. “Wealth is not income” he tells the audience to a mix of affirmative murmurs and rapt silence. “Wealth is accumulated assets. So when we talk about the wealth gap we’re not talking about the income gap.”

The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston report came to a similar conclusion citing research that found racial differences in income and racial differences in wealth are only weakly correlated. So when Pelton took over the helm of Boston’s oldest and arguably most august philanthropic foundation he urged it to focus not on income but on the biggest contributor to wealth: real estate.

Homeownership has been one of the greatest sources of wealth—and generational wealth—accumulation in this country. But research has shown that for decades Black Americans were unable to access this opportunity due to codified lending discrimination and racially exclusionary zoning practices. The legacy? As of 2021 in Greater Boston 70 percent of white households compared to 37 percent of Black households 31 percent of Hispanic households and 57 percent of Asian households own homes according to a research brief published in November 2022 by the foundation’s research center Boston Indicators. Even if there were no racial discrimination in the housing market today the effects of past government policies on Black Americans’ ability to buy homes and accumulate wealth through them would continue to fuel the racial gap in wealth and homeownership.

To increase those numbers at Pelton’s direction the Boston Foundation has quietly summoned dozens of business government and nonprofit leaders to form the Greater Boston Partnership to Close the Racial Wealth Gap. The coalition is hardly the first group to try to solve this problem. But with everyone from Obi to Boston Chief of Housing Sheila Dillon to the top brass of local and national banks in the fold the nascent group is the most expansive and influential effort yet aimed at addressing the gap. “It’s new in the sense that we have more people at the table and more decision makers who can I would hope make change” says Symone Crawford the executive director of the Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance and a member of the partnership.

The foundation’s coalition has perhaps learned from the hard lessons of the past appealing not to the state’s better angels but to its wallet. During his convention panel Pelton mentioned a Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation finding from 2021 that closing the wealth gap in Black and Hispanic communities would generate $25 billion for the Massachusetts economy over a five-year span the equivalent of creating 100000 jobs. “This is not a zero-sum game” Pelton told the audience. “If we close the racial wealth gap it lifts all boats. We all prosper.”

A bottom-line approach may sound like a swerve for someone who until two years ago worked in the ivory tower. But Pelton wasn’t your average college president. At Emerson he embedded himself in the city’s business and political firmament becoming a trusted confidant to former Mayor Marty Walsh and current and former Chamber of Commerce presidents Jim Rooney and Paul Guzzi among many others. “There are lots of things that happen in Boston that Lee has a finger in very quietly and behind-the-scenes” says Colette Phillips the president and CEO of Colette Phillips Communications and one of the many seekers of Pelton’s counsel.

Pelton’s influence officially moved from the hushed backchannels of Boston’s power elite to the public sphere when a letter—which famously and passionately stated that America was “on fire”—that he’d written after George Floyd’s murder went viral. In it he revealed a powerful side of himself few people had previously seen sharing painful personal confrontations with racism and the long-simmering frustrations he felt deep within. Through op-eds and TV appearances Pelton soon became nothing short of the city’s moral authority. And when he left Emerson for the Boston Foundation he had both universal respect and a perch from which to flex that social capital.

Now past the age when many retire Pelton has staked out perhaps his most ambitious mission yet—one that others in this town have taken on over the past few decades and failed to achieve. Still Pelton seems undaunted. “Not everything that is faced can be changed” he says quoting James Baldwin “but nothing can be changed until it is faced.”

It can be easy to forget that Pelton left the world of higher ed just two years ago. This feels particularly true on a fall morning inside “Lee’s Library” at the Boston Foundation’s Back Bay offices where Pelton’s crisp blue suit Allbirds and a gray 5 o’clock shadow evoke GQ more than campus-casual. But as he sits in a rocking chair emblazoned with Emerson College’s seal and speaks in the deliberate contemplative cadence of someone who could seemingly give office hours in perpetuity you could be forgiven for imagining him in a corduroy jacket with elbow patches. Even in his new digs the man who stopped teaching long ago is as professorial as ever.

Pelton’s path to a seat in Boston’s upper echelon of influence began in 1970s Kansas. After graduating from Wichita State University where he studied 19th-century British literature he announced to his father that he wanted to go to graduate school in Boston to study poetry. “You’re going to Boston?” he recalls his father saying. “You know that’s the most racist city in America.”

It wasn’t as though the family hadn’t seen racism in their backyard. Situated in a Black enclave on the outskirts of Wichita their home didn’t have indoor plumbing unlike the homes in the city’s predominantly white neighborhoods until Pelton was six and a city sewer line arrived belatedly. Later the gas station his father took over after years of working at a meat-packing plant was expropriated. “There was a major part of the highway that as it always does came through the Black neighborhood and took out his service station” Lee says with a rueful chuckle alluding to the widespread and sometimes deliberate construction of thoroughfares in communities of color during the mid-20th century which led to displacement and disinvestment. Both experiences in his youth he would come to understand represented examples of systemic racism the implicit and explicit discrimination historically baked into policies and institutions across the country.

Pelton also had an early brush with housing discrimination in Kansas—and fought back. While in college in Wichita a landlord told him her house wasn’t available to rent. Suspicious Pelton asked a white classmate to inquire. “He got a very different response” remembers Pelton who ultimately found another place to live. Even at 19 years old he wasn’t surprised by the incident but the injustice still unsettled him. He filed a complaint which was successful; the landlord was fined.

Still to the Pelton family Boston’s racism was notorious: The city after all had received national attention for its racist pushback to busing a federally mandated effort to desegregate schools that began in 1974. By then decades of lending discrimination in the housing market had already embedded racial divisions across the city.

None of that however was enough to deter Pelton from studying at Harvard University. He earned a doctorate in English and American Literature in 1983 and taught for a bit before deciding that he preferred to work in the institutional side of higher education. After stints as a dean at Colgate University and Dartmouth College he assumed the top post at Willamette University in Oregon in 1998. Though he liked the Pacific Northwest his time at Harvard convinced him that he was a New Englander by temperament and he sought a path back East.

In 2011 Pelton landed right on Boston Common becoming president of Emerson College after the search committee unanimously voted him the best candidate for the position. Pelton quickly oversaw the revitalization and expansion of the small college’s footprint: About a third of his job he estimates entailed work outside of the school and in the city itself. “Institutions of higher education can be somewhat navel-watchers and they stay in their realm” says Colette Phillips who was a member of the search committee. “Lee brought a whole different lens to the job.”

Bostonians took note. Prominent institutions including the Boston Arts Academy Foundation the Museum of Fine Arts the Barr Foundation and GBH asked Pelton to sit on their boards. Yet it wasn’t until he wrote an unsparing moral missive to the Emerson community in the wake of George Floyd’s murder that Pelton’s stature rose and his path out of higher education and into his current role as a civic leader began.

One night days after George Floyd was murdered on a strip of asphalt under the knee of officer Derek Chauvin Pelton stayed up until the small hours of the morning in his Beacon Hill college president’s residence replaying the video repeatedly. On Saturday of that week as he watched protests erupt across the nation he felt he was still too angry to make a meaningful public statement. “I didn’t want to write a piece that was full of platitudes and that would seem performative because that’s what college presidents often do” he recalls.

It didn’t help that he received emails from Emerson students who blamed him for not speaking up already. “Do you understand how difficult it must be for me to speak out on what happened in an authentic way?” he remembers telling one white student. Even talking about it now he grimaces and raises his voice his anguish apparent. “And then I said to him ‘This is not my problem; this is your problem.’”

That premise became part of the letter. “What are you going to do?” he wrote with “you” in bold type. Calling Floyd’s slaying a “legalized lynching” he stated that “Black Americans are invisible to most of white America. We live in the shadows—even those of us who like me sit at the table of bounty.”

He also shared specific times he’d experienced racism from getting spit on by a white parking-lot attendant to having cops draw guns on him mere feet from his house to being called the n-word everywhere he’s lived. News outlets including this one ran the letter in its entirety which helped spread its reach to upward of an estimated 6 million people.

Afterward Pelton started receiving national attention. “I could go to about any setting and people I didn’t know would say ‘Oh I read that. That was important.’ It was just supposed to be a letter to my children essentially and to my community but it became much more than that.”

Part of its viral power was its deviance from the rote institutional statements that surfaced amid Black Lives Matter protests. Still Pelton wanted to accomplish more than simply authoring a resonant call to action that produced 15 minutes of viral fame. He wanted to tackle the biggest problem plaguing his adopted city—and he found the perfect place to pursue his grand vision.

The classical Revival building at 75 Arlington Street is as old as the billion-dollar community foundation inside it that has dominated Boston’s philanthropic scene over the past century. In the nearly 110 years since it was founded the Boston Foundation has helped build the city backing everything from a burn unit at Mass General to the Boston Symphony Orchestra to aid tents during the pandemic—the 1918 one that is. And yet as lengthy and wide as the charity’s civic reach has been it has failed—like every other institution in Boston—to remedy the racial injustices of the city’s past and present.

Still due to the Boston Foundation’s influence Pelton saw it as a place that could help him channel the fire within him into action given he says that its “civic leadership is unparalleled in the commonwealth.” So when longtime Boston Foundation president Paul Grogan announced in January 2020 that he was stepping down Pelton saw an opportunity to start a new chapter of his career just a few blocks away from his perch at Emerson.

To many it seemed to be a perfect fit. “Lee has been long engaged with the Greater Boston business community” says Eastern Bank chair and CEO Bob Rivers. “He’s been a leading voice on issues of racial equity. He’s been a convener. So when he became the latest CEO of the Boston Foundation it was a very logical fit since it plays so well to his experiences interests and his reputation.”

Pelton too felt like it was a natural move for him. “I’ve said jokingly that I’ve been in training all my life for this role and it suits me perfectly. Because my impulse to be engaged in the larger society is represented in this position” he says before getting professorial again and quoting a dead dude the late urban architect Daniel Burnham. “Make no little plans. They have no magic to stir men’s blood and probably will not themselves be realized” Pelton recites. “I live by that perspective.”

Pelton put his not-so-little plans into place after he assumed direction of the foundation in June 2021 and swiftly embedded equity at the center of its historically expansive mission tired of seeing communities in Boston experience the cascading effects of financial instability. He compares it to Jenga: “You pull out one block and it creates stress. You pull out another block; it creates more stress. You pull out too many; it creates trauma. And that’s what we’re finding in these communities. They don’t have the building blocks that they need for wealth and—I’m using it in a really Anglo-Saxon way—well-being.” Wealth Pelton explains is derived from the English “weal.” In other words wealth isn’t just about money but health. And the connection is real. A Boston Public Health Commission analysis this year found that the average life expectancy in a section of Roxbury one of the poorest and most dangerous neighborhoods in the city is 69 years compared with 92 years in an area of the Back Bay one of the city’s wealthiest areas.

Pelton knew that numerous nonprofits and government agencies were working to close the equity gap; the number of groups dedicated to helping others in Boston is part of why he loves the city. But something critical had been missing—something Pelton was uniquely poised to provide. All too often the public and private sectors work in silos former Governor Deval Patrick says. “If somebody’s not convening those conversations they’re not going to happen.”

Pelton’s approach to solving this problem was to do what he does best: get people together. That meant forming a roundtable of representatives from different areas of the city everyone from nonprofit leaders to mayoral cabinet members to bank CEOs who would meet regularly to work on identifying ways to close the racial wealth gap. “Lee is able to speak with and engage I think just about every sector in this region” Patrick says.

In fact Pelton had already proven he could harness this skill to effect change. When former Lieutenant Governor Evelyn Murphy the first woman in the state to hold a constitutional office needed someone to take over management of the Wage Equity Now coalition in 2022 she turned to Pelton and the Boston Foundation. For years the group’s effort to pass a law to help close the gender and racial wage gaps had fallen short in the legislature. Pelton recognized its importance and relevance to his mission. After he communications vice president Keith Mahoney and others at the foundation took the reins the salary transparency bill finally passed both chambers this fall—a prime example of a coalition creating change. “It’s not bombastic leadership—like ‘I’ve got the right way and come follow me.’ He has a presence to him that’s commanding because it is not loud” Murphy says of Pelton. “He has a different style of leadership than many in Boston.”

At the same time Pelton isn’t afraid of being resolute—such as when he made one critical choice about the foundation’s approach to closing the racial wealth gap. While Wage Equity Now and other nonprofits working on the issue are focused on income and the foundation itself touts a business equity fund Pelton narrowed this coalition’s focus solely to homeownership—“because homeownership on average represents the largest component of wealth for families and individuals” he says.

Many agreed with Pelton’s circumscribed plan including Ron O’Hanley chairman and CEO of State Street Corporation and a member of the Boston Foundation’s Board of Trustees who says the approach is likely “going to move the needle most quickly.” Meanwhile Rivers said the focus of the new partnership distinguishes it from other broad-scale efforts to close the racial wealth gap. “We’re not trying to boil the ocean here” Rivers says. “It’s addressing this one particular fundamental aspect that drives racial wealth inequities.”

Pelton is more visionary than wonk though; he isn’t steeped in housing policy and the political calculus required to change it. So when the Greater Boston Partnership to Close the Racial Wealth Gap first started meeting in late 2022 and its 40-plus members took turns sharing their expertise to help the group figure out where to even begin work on increasing homeownership in communities of color Pelton listened.

It was par for the course for the soft-spoken leader who has never been the loudest voice in meetings O’Hanley notes—“more often than not I seem to be struggling to hear him” he says of Pelton’s quiet delivery. At the same time Pelton’s open-minded style of discussion prevents discourse around a hot topic from becoming overheated. “He has a sort of Socratic way of asking questions asking you why you think a certain way about something” says Leigh Gaspar a vice president and special assistant to Pelton at the foundation who followed him there from Emerson.

By fall Pelton and company had made some headway. Between quarterly steering committee meetings three workgroups would focus on three critical factors that can make homeownership more attainable in communities of color: increasing down-payment assistance access to affordable mortgage products and housing supply. The group would accomplish its goals by drafting policies suggesting new programs and conducting research.

On the research front the foundation is working on addressing the wealth gap by measuring it again. Last year the Boston Fed announced that it would be updating the infamous study from 2015 in partnership with the Barr Foundation the Boston Foundation the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce and the Eastern Bank Foundation. The slew of media reports in the aftermath of its release often left out some important context—the study’s small sample size of just 71 non-immigrant Black families for instance. It also was lost upon some who didn’t dig into the details of the report that the median net worth of Boston’s robust Black Caribbean community was a much higher—albeit still highly distressing—$12000. Given the limitations in the original Fed study the new three-year research project will aim to reach a much larger sample this time perhaps thousands of families to more rigorously examine the factors that contribute to wealth disparities across the state. The partnership will take the new data into consideration as it recommends ways to increase homeownership in communities of color.

When it comes to down-payment assistance Pelton says he has an idea but wouldn’t yet share any specifics. Nor would he share any plans about what the partnership might do regarding philanthropy for mortgage assistance. As the group works out its concrete plans there is some skepticism even from within the foundation about how much it can really accomplish.

After the panel at the Mass Black Expo the crowd Pelton couldn’t see through the harsh stage lighting comes at him. In fact he can hardly make his way off the stage thanks to audience members swarming him. Michelle Brathwaite who holds seminars on building Black wealth around the city swoops in and asks for a selfie. “Just reach out to me” he tells her. On his way out the door he shares his email address with a group of Babson College students.

Courtney Brunson remembers similar exchanges when she sat on a panel with Pelton at last year’s Mass Black Expo. Greeting event planners and servers like he would the bankers and other power players on stage that day Pelton displayed a level of humility that stuck with her. The former policy adviser at BECMA and president of Harvard’s Legal Aid Bureau had never been interested in working at an “institution on a hill”—a nonprofit at a remove from the needs and perspectives of the communities it was serving. But with an equity-focused Pelton at the helm of the Boston Foundation Brunson saw an opportunity to make a difference. As the new director of the Greater Boston Partnership to Close the Racial Wealth Gap Brunson’s job is essentially to help expedite Pelton’s mission and turn his vision into tangible change.

Making that happen will be no easy task. Down-payment dollars and mortgage products are critical but can only help if there’s something to buy. Due in part to zoning laws that prevent the construction of multi­family homes in certain neighborhoods housing supply remains scant in many communities around the state increasingly driving prices up and pushing younger generations out. Communities everywhere—including in predominantly white and wealthy suburbs—will have to do their part to increase construction of multi-family homes experts say to increase the housing stock.

Today’s sky-high interest rates don’t help either. “The headwinds are just really really strong right now” says Clark Ziegler an executive at the nonprofit Massachusetts Housing Partnership which administers one of the state’s largest affordable mortgage loans ONE Mortgage. “I wouldn’t call it an elephant in the room but I think that’s the factor here that is impossible to ignore right? It’s an environment that’s just not conducive to first-time homeownership.”

Of course homeownership is still just one part of the problem. Research has shown that differences in retirement savings and marriage rates between Black and white people feed the racial wealth gap—even as they are also caused by it—which means that as ambitious as Pelton’s mission is it may not move the needle enough. This year the Institute for Policy Studies and the National Community Reinvestment Coalition examined progress in the wealth gap since just before the March on Washington in 1962 and found that at the current rate of change it would take 780 years for Black wealth to equal non-Black wealth in the United States.

All of this has some advocates nervous about the mission of Pelton’s group. “When I hear about a public-private partnership for a problem that historically has been more heavy on the public side I always look at that kind of suspiciously” says Reggie Stewart the Massachusetts liaison for the American Descendants of Slavery Advocacy Foundation (ADOS). Instead ADOS advocates for a federal program of reparations that returns money and land to descendants of chattel slavery. “Because the gap is so massive” Stewart says “nothing short of a direct transfer of wealth solves a wealth gap of this size that’s been allowed to go on for this long.”

Even inside the foundation some are urging caution about how much impact the partnership might have. “I do think we need to be careful not to over-promise how much any one local effort like this can really meaningfully close the large multigenerational racial wealth gap in Greater Boston” says Luc Schuster the executive director of Boston Indicators at the Boston Foundation. At the same time he adds “that shouldn’t be interpreted as a reason not to work on this.”

Pelton acknowledges that at a local level the partnership’s progress on fixing the gap may be incremental. If the effort doesn’t result in change it will have accomplished about as much as all of those platitudinous statements after George Floyd’s death. And it would render the man behind it another well-intentioned person in this town who couldn’t narrow Boston’s most shameful statistic.

On the other hand if Pelton can show how the group’s actions led directly to greater levels of homeownership—and thus greater wealth—it “will have done something really very special” Pelton says. What he really wants is the scaffolding for finally facing this structural problem to endure long after he’s left the foundation. “The success of this program” he says “is if it survives me.”

History Makes the Present

Decades of racial discrimination in the housing and mortgage markets have robbed generations of people of color the opportunity to accumulate wealth. Here’s how.

1930s to 1960s

The Federal Housing Administration revolutionized the mortgage market by introducing long-term loans with down payments of no more than 10 percent that were fully amortized allowing homeowners to accumulate equity while still paying off the loan. This resulted in one of the greatest vehicles for generational wealth accumulation in the nation’s history. Left out of the wealth-building bonanza were many Black Americans and immigrants. That’s because the federal Home Owners’ Loan Corporation assessed neighborhoods for mortgage lenders shading supposedly “high-risk” areas in red to steer clear of. Oftentimes the basis for an area’s so-called redlining on the map was merely the presence of people of color and immigrants.

1968

Following the passage of the Fair Housing Act the Boston Banks Urban Renewal Group (BBURG) attempted to increase Black homeownership by drawing their own red line around parts of Roxbury Dorchester and Mattapan that would provide access rather than exclusion from federally backed loans. But the reverse redlining of BBURG as it was known led to hasty sales on over-valued homes without proper inspections at the hands of corrupt real estate agents and lenders. Rather than generate wealth it caused foreclosures.

Late 1990s to 2011

In the late 1990s and early 2000s lenders disproportionately targeted Black Americans for subprime mortgage loans even when applicants qualified for conventional ones. As a result the fallout from the subsequent 2008 housing crisis was felt more strongly in Boston’s Black communities decimating wealth in a population already challenged by discriminatory housing practices. In Boston according to the nonprofit City Life/Vida Urbana there were 4000-plus foreclosures between 2006 and 2011 and more than 80 percent took place in Boston’s historical neighborhoods of color.

The Housing Warriors

The Boston Foundation isn’t alone in its quest to increase homeownership in communities of color. These four groups have already made some progress.

Citizens’ Housing and Planning Association (CHAPA)

What It Does: Advocates for the production and preservation of affordable housing statewide.

What It’s Accomplished: Helped engineer and pass the Massachusetts Affordable Housing Law (Chapter 40B) in 1969 to aid low- and moderate-income buyers. It also assisted with the launch of a new website mymasshome.org that helps homebuyers navigate assistance programs and other steps of the home-buying process.

Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance (MAHA)

What It Does: Fights for affordable housing while administering homebuyer and homeowner education programs.

What It’s Accomplished: Created a first-in-the-nation program STASH First-Gen Home that provides $20000 in a matching grant to buyers who earn the state’s median income or less and take the organization’s first-time homebuyer classes.

Massachusetts Housing Partnership (MHP)

What It Does: Develops policy and financing ideas to create more affordable housing by working with government leaders and private lenders as a quasi-public agency. Co-administers of the MassDreams program which disburses down-payment and closing-cost assistance to communities disproportionately hurt by the pandemic.

What It’s Accomplished: Manages ONE Mortgage which has helped more than 22000 low- and moderate-income state households purchase homes by offering 30-year fixed-interest loans at discounted rates. Distributed a total of $13.1 million in MassDREAMS funding to 510 homebuyers to date 76 percent of whom identify as people of color.

MassHousing

What It Does: Sells bonds to raise capital for the benefit of low- and moderate-income homebuyers and homeowners as well as developers. Co-administers of the MassDreams program.

What It’s Accomplished: The organization has provided more than $27 billion for affordable housing since its inception—and through MassDreams distributed a total of $37.4 million in funding to 1140 homebuyers 54 percent of whom were people of color.

The Quincy-based Real estate investment firm bought a seven-building office portfolio in Wellesley from Haynes Management Inc. for $48.5 million the Boston Business Journal reported.

The properties concentrated mainly in Wellesley Hills house various businesses including medical providers law and accounting firms and financial services advisory firms.

Here is a breakdown of the acquired properties and their corresponding sale prices:

40 Grove St. ($15 million)

326-332 Washington St./6 Abbott ($11.4 million)

16 Laurel Ave. ($10 million)

336 Washington St. ($5 million)

366 Washington St. ($4.15 million)

10 Prescott St. ($1.7 million)

16 Prescott St. ($1.25 million)

The portfolio acquisition involved extensive negotiations with Haynes a process initially geared toward a larger portfolio before honing in on the final seven-building transaction. Delays were attributed to the credit crunch.

A $23.7 million mortgage loan from Brookline Bank was secured for the transaction.

Most of Haynes’ remaining properties are located in Wellesley with a few in Newton according to the company’s website.

Michael Greeley and Newmark team marketed the properties and brokered the transaction according to Jumbo’s managing partner Jay Hirsch.

The office market in the Boston area has shown signs of thawing.

Earlier this month local firm City Realty Group bought 186 Lincoln Street in Boston for $11 million or about $150 per square foot marking a significant drop from its previous sale price of $20.7 million eight years ago the publication reported. While the property’s value dropped the acquisition is part of a trend as several downtown office properties have changed hands in the past few months breaking a prolonged period of stagnancy in the market.

Additionally real estate firm Synergy Investments purchased One Liberty Square a 13-story office building in the Financial District of downtown Boston for $45 million which is a 17 percent decrease from the building’s value a decade ago the Boston Globe reported.

The firm intends to maintain 186 Lincoln as office space and has plans to enhance the building’s amenities with an estimated investment of around $1 million.

10 underrated houseplants

Our expert pick of underrated houseplants are all easy to grow and undemanding types - criteria which are always top of our list when we're choosing houseplants.

They are unusual have interesting qualities and look good if you enjoy decorating with plants to brighten up your living space. Now to find out what's on our list.

1. Chinese evergreen

Botanical name: Aglaonema

Most underrated for: air-purifying

While we've all heard about the beneficial properties of plants like peace lilies that purify the air while we sleep and weeping fig plants that mop up toxins the Chinese evergreen plant might not be on your radar - yet.

'In my humble opinion this plant genus is highly underrated and isn’t raved about nearly enough' says Kamili Bell Hill creator of Plantblerd founder of Black People with Plants and author of Happy Plants Happy You! available from Amazon.

'They are spectacular. If it's variegation you seek this is the plant for you. You can find them with leaves of green and white pink and white red and green and different shades of green.'

These leafy lovelies are one of the most underrated air-purifying plants. There are a huge number of varieties to choose from in a range of lovely colors. They are a good choice for low light rooms and require little watering.

It's also one of the most durable houseplants you can grow tolerating low light dry air and drought. Look out for the variety Aglaonema 'Silver Bay'.

'It has striking green foliage and an easy-going nature' according to the plant experts at Bloomscape. 'The large leaves are detailed with an icy green center flowing into dark and light green striped edges retaining their color and pattern in even the lowest lighting conditions.'

Kamili Bell Hill Social Links Navigation Author and Planterior Designer Kamili Bell Hill combines her love of plants and design to curate a brand and community known as PlantBlerd where she partners beautiful houseplants with simple care information and words of encouragement. PlantBlerd serves as both a style and a growing guide. After noticing a lack of social media platforms highlighting houseplant collectors that look like her she established BlackPeople.WPlants featuring Black houseplant collectors from around the world. She put a career in law on hold to pursue her true passion of interior design and quickly realized the important role plants play in her clients’ designs.

2. Whale fin snake plant

Botanical name: Sansevieria masoniana (Dracaena masoniana)

Most underrated for: low light rooms

We're all familiar with the tall sword-shaped foliage of the regular snake plant but this variety is a little more unusual. Whale fin is a giant version that can grow up to 4-6 feet tall although admittedly it will take a long time to do so. It has attractive wide dark green leaves and the gorgeous coloring intensifies if you position your plant in a low light spot.

This is the plant to choose if you want something that will thrive in the shade of a hallway. Although it tolerates low light you will get faster growth if you place it in bright indirect light.

Like all snake plants this one is easy to propagate. You can simply cut leaf segments and root them in soil or grow them in water to expand your collection of these shapely specimens.

3. Crispy wave fern

Botanical name: Asplenium nidus

Most underrated: easy to grow fern

If you have struggled with your Boston fern turning brown or your asparagus fern turning yellow it could be time to switch your allegiance to one of the most underrated ferns around as Kamili Bell Hill has discovered.

'Just when I thought all was lost I stumbled upon the crispy wave a fern so different from all the others' she explains. 'Instead of small delicate leafy fronds it has these big paddle-like fronds that feel like lettuce and kind of look like a Boston fern leaflet.

'It was a love connection! This cultivar matched my energy and enthusiasm. And more importantly it matched my growing environment without a hitch. Unlike the others this fern was able to adapt to average household humidity. The crispy wave showed me the meaning of true fern love. And now here we are – I water she grows. It’s a beautiful thing.'

This hard-to-kill fern is a good choice if you have a chill plant parent style and a bad track records with other types of fern plant.

4. Stromanthe Triostar

Botanical name: Stromanthe Sanguinea 'Triostar'

Most underrated for: fantastic foliage

This stunning plant has variegated leaves in shades of pink green and white. A real beauty that will add a vibrant new color mix to your plant collection its star qualities are reflected in the name. We think you should be snapping one up now.

'Help its variegation stay vibrant by placing it in a spot that receives bright indirect light' says Eliza Blank founder of The Sill. 'The stromanthe is part of the same family as prayer plants and will similarly appreciate high humidity from a pebble tray or humidifier.'

The more indirect light the plant receives the more variegation you will see on the leaves. Too much bright light and this beauty will lose some of the color variation that catches the eye in the first place. Another plus is that the stromanthe has air purifying qualities too.

5. Avocado plant

Botanical name: Persea americana

Most underrated: free plant

Instead of throwing all those avocado stones away why not grow new houseplants from them? These leafy lovelies are one of the best kitchen plants as well as making an interesting display on a warm bright windowsill or in a humid conservatory. Given a combination of light humidity and regular watering avocado plants will thrive.

As the plants grow pinch out the tips regularly to create bushy well-shaped plants. Find out more about how to grow avocados if the idea appeals. There are several techniques including the toothpick method where you partially submerge the stone in water or alternatively submerge the whole stone in water. It can take a few weeks and up to several months to germinate but it's well worth the wait.

6. Variegated Swiss cheese plant

Botanical name: Monstera deliciosa variegata

Most underrated for: making a statement in your living room

The Swiss cheese plant is instantly recognisable and adds a stylish statement to any interior. But if you want to introduce a new type of Swiss cheese to mix up the look of your foliage try a variegated one.

'The variegated version of the popular Monstera plant has become something like the holy grail of the Plant Tribe' according to Igor Josifovic and Judith de Graaff authors of the bestselling books Urban Jungle: Living and Styling with Plants (available to order from Amazon) and Plant Tribe (also available from Amazon).

'This rare variety is hard to find and even when you do find it it tends to be pretty pricey. But if you’re lucky enough to come across one (or to receive a cutting from a plant friend) don’t think twice. Go for it and add this botanical gem to your living room.'

Place your variegated Swiss cheese in a warm spot that gets bright indirect light and keep it moister than you would its non-variegated cousin. If you're interested in growing your collection find out how to propagate a monstera by taking stem cuttings as they will root easily especially if they're already growing aerial roots.

7. Purple passion plant

The eye-popping violet foliage of the purple passion plant offers an unusual and attractive choice for brightly lit rooms. In fact the brighter light will intensify the purple color of this plant giving it a lovely shimmering iridescence.

The velvety leaves (the reason it is also known as the velvet plant) have a cascading habit that makes it ideal for indoor hanging baskets if you like a tropical jungle look. This is definitely one of the most underrated houseplants that deserves your attention if you want to introduce a vivid accent to your room.



Despite their exotic appearance these plants are fairly easy to care for making them an excellent choice for novice plant parents.

Most underrated for: year-round flowers

The blooms of the attractive and easy-to-grow shrimp plant appear nearly all year round.

The arching flower sprays are salmon-pink colored and come from the plants plentiful bracts (modified leaves) which helps explain why the 'flowers' are so prolific.

This plant is easy to please and if it likes your growing conditions can reach up to 3 feet. All it requires are warm days cool nights and a sunny windowsill to call home. If your plant gets a little straggly snip it back by about a half to encourage new growth and it will quickly bush up again.

One of the best indoor flowering plants it's a good attention grabbing variety to choose if your plant collection is looking a little too uniformly green and you want an easy long-flowering indoor plant to add some color.

9. Wax plant

Botanical name: Hoya carnosa

Most underrated for: blooms

The very collectable trailing Hoya carnosa plant has exquisite clusters of waxy star-shaped cream flowers and dark green leaves on vigorous twining stems that can reach 15 foot or more. Easy to grow and take care of? Yes. Fast growing? Absolutely.

'Once you add any single plant from the Hoya genus you will be hooked' says Kamili Bell Hill. 'You will not be able to stop at one because they are just delightful. Of all the plant discoveries I have made this is probably my favorite. You’ll add them for their foliage and obsess over them because of their otherworldly blooms. This genus was completely unknown to me before I started collecting plants. Now I am obsessed.'

Kamili likens the fantastic blooms to delicate confectionery flowers crafted from marzipan or fondant frosting something you might find on a tiered wedding cake.

Hoya plants love a spot with bright indirect light in your bathroom or kitchen which tend to be more humid. Find out how to care for hoya plants and give them the right conditions then they will develop into a large vining statement plant in a relatively short period of time. They look good trailing down from shelves or in a hanging planter too.

Botanical name: Echeveria agavoides

Most underrated: succulent

If like us you're a big fan of succulents you'll always be on the lookout for unusual varieties to grow your collection. While super-appealing echeveria are probably already on your radar the stunning lipstick variety might be new to you.

The red-tinged leaf edges of this pretty plant develop best in sunlight so it's a great choice for sunny windowsills where it will grow up to 5 inches tall and will spread to 12 inches making it a pretty decent sized succulent. The more light you give them the more red coloration you will get too.

Also known as moulded wax or wax agave it's a joy to look after especially as you don't have to water it for half the year (from October to May). They're also easy to propagate as you can gently pull off any offsets or individual leaves and pot them up separately in gritty soil.

If you like what you read and want it in your inbox sign up here.

Though it’s been hard to adjust to the past month of earlier nightfall I can’t say I’m disappointed with the beautiful sunsets that have graced the skies on these colder clear days — filled with rich rosy shades of red and pink swirling with the clouds to create a cosmic smoothie.

Summer sunsets can be lovely. But if you ask me the colors at play during an autumn or winter sunset are consistently better — and as it turns out there’s science to back up that opinion.

“Sunsets are more vibrant in winter months” local meteorologist and weather expert Danielle Noyes told me.

But why? I asked Noyes to help to explain this fascinating scientific phenomenon.

What determines the colors we see in the sky?

Let’s start with the basics. While all the colors of the rainbow exist in sunlight the color you see when you look up at the sky is determined by a physical process called “Rayleigh scattering.”

(NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory)

The process describes what happens to the waves of sunlight as they come toward us. As they travel through the atmosphere they’re met by molecules like nitrogen and oxygen and small particles that reflect the light’s rays causing them to scatter across the sky.

As Noyes explained “each color has its own wavelength.” That wavelength determines how far a color has to travel before our eyes recognize it. Blue and violet light in particular are reflected by the elements in our atmosphere which is why we see blue during the day.

But at sunset as we rotate away from the sun light has to travel farther — through more of the atmosphere — to reach our eyes.

“Essentially more atmosphere means more molecules to scatter violets and blues away from your eyes leaving other colors like yellow orange and red” Noyes said.

The recipe for a perfect winter sunset

So what makes the sunset especially vibrant in the winter? There are three main factors to consider: The weather our region here in New England and the positioning of the Earth.

“When it’s cooler out and less humid there’s less water vapor in the air” said Noyes. Fewer particles in the air results in less light being scattered. “In turn colors can look bolder” she added.

A storm rolling in can make for a beautiful sunset too. For example when a Nor’easter is coming cirrus clouds often arrive well in advance of the storm itself. “Made up of ice crystals these clouds certainly decorate the sky and allow for extra vivid sunset displays” Noyes said.

Additionally much of the cold winter air we feel in New England often travels down from Canada or the Arctic where the air is typically cleaner said Noyes. “Fresh clean air results in a crisper sunset.” (The perfect counterexample of course being the hazy red sunsets we experienced this past summer due to some not-so-clean Canadian air.)

“The Earth [also] spins closer to the sun in winter and the sun sets at a sharper angle making sunset colors last a bit longer than in summer months” said Noyes. That means a winter sunset lingers on the horizon giving us more time to enjoy it.

Still beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Some people may be partial to that hazy summer sunset over the vibrance of winter.

“I have found that there will always be ongoing debates on sunrise and sunset beauty” said Noyes. “It is after all very subjective.”

(NASDAQ:ILMN) Potentially Undervalued?,"Illumina Inc. ( ) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Illumina’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.

Is Illumina Still Cheap?

The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 19% below my intrinsic value which means if you buy Illumina today you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $136.35 then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Illumina’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market providing a prime buying opportunity.

Can we expect growth from Illumina?

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 67% over the next year the near-term future seems bright for Illumina. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock which should feed into a higher share valuation.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? ILMN’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price with shares trading around its fair value. However there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ILMN now may not be the most optimal time to buy given it is trading around its fair value. However the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

After completing its $69 billion acquisition of cloud-computing company VMWare Broadcom CEO Hock Tan issued a direct order to his new employees about where they must work. “If you live within 50 miles of an office you get your butt in here” he told the workers of previously remote-friendly VMWare.

The comments came during a meeting Tan hosted on Tuesday after the merger between the two companies officially closed following approval from Chinese regulators. Like many other executives Tan cited in-person work’s benefits to collaboration and company culture. “Collaboration is important and a key part of sustaining a culture with your peers with your colleagues” he said.

There was no word on what employees thought of the mandate specifically but there had been reports of broader concerns regarding the merger with Broadcom according to Business Insider. Broadcom has a history of chafing at remote work even during the pandemic going as far as ordering some employees back to the office as early as April 2020 in defiance of California’s statewide stay-at-home orders.

In recent months a growing amount of research has pointed to the benefits of in-person work especially when it comes to on-the-job training and career advancement. On the other hand proponents of remote work say it can help close gaps in promotion rates for women for example. And workers seem to prefer at least partial remote-work flexibility to the point that some would even be willing to take a 20% pay cut in order to keep the perk. However in contrast to Broadcom some companies such as Atlassian Dropbox and Airbnb have remained committed to remote work.

Broadcom isn’t alone in its back-to-the-office mandate. Insurance company Farmers Group faced an outcry from employees when new CEO Raul Vargas reversed his predecessor’s remote-work policy. In February Amazon changed its pandemic-era remote-work policy to require employees to be in the office at least three days a week. The e-commerce giant went as far as asking managers to consider office attendance alongside other factors like job performance when evaluating whether someone should get a promotion.

Many other CEOs have opted for the carrot instead of the stick when trying to curb remote work. In KPMG’s annual CEO survey 90% of respondents said they’d reward employees who make an effort to come into the office with “favorable assignments raises or promotions.” Others have tried to spin it as a necessary sacrifice for the greater good of the company. “You might be able to execute your work on time and to standard in a remote environment but what about your colleagues?” wrote Jake Wood CEO of software company Groundswell on LinkedIn this summer. “Absent your presence leadership mentorship—can they thrive?”

At Broadcom Tan permitted remote work only in very limited cases such as employees in the sales department who had to meet with clients regularly. Those who didn’t meet Tan’s requirements would need to clear an extraordinarily high bar. “Any other exception you better learn how to walk on water if you want to work remote” he told employees. “I’m serious.”

Throughout the meeting Tan and VMWare employees discussed how the two corporate cultures would mesh now that they were part of the same company. Return to office though wasn’t the only point of contention between VMWare and its new parent. When a VMWare employee asked if Broadcom would support employee resource groups (ERGs) Tan again offered a skeptical answer. “What is that? I’m just kidding. You want me to be direct? That’s an alien concept to me” he said.

While Tan admitted ERGs which provide support for groups of underrepresented employees weren’t part of Broadcom’s culture he said he was open to them. Broadcom did not respond to a request for comment from Fortune about whether it would allow VMWare employees to continue their existing ERGs.

Adding to the difficulties in integrating the two companies were the looming layoffs that are often a harsh reality of corporate mergers. Broadcom laid off approximately 1300 VMWare employees after the deal was completed while VMWare president Sumit Dhawan left to become the CEO of cybersecurity firm Proofpoint.

Many of Broadcom’s employees will move into VMWare’s Palo Alto headquarters which ironically had been largely empty thanks to its long-standing remote-work policy according to the San Francisco Standard.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVoaW5kdWJ1c2luZXNzbGluZS5jb20vY29tcGFuaWVzL2Jyb2FkY29tLXRvLWN1dC1hbG1vc3QtMTMwMC12bXdhcmUtam9icy1pbi1jYWxpZm9ybmlhLWFmdGVyLXRha2VvdmVyL2FydGljbGU2NzU5MzM5OC5lY2XSAYwBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlaGluZHVidXNpbmVzc2xpbmUuY29tL2NvbXBhbmllcy9icm9hZGNvbS10by1jdXQtYWxtb3N0LTEzMDAtdm13YXJlLWpvYnMtaW4tY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1hZnRlci10YWtlb3Zlci9hcnRpY2xlNjc1OTMzOTguZWNlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Broadcom to cut almost 1300 VMware jobs in California after takeover,"Broadcom Inc. plans to fire almost 1300 VMware Inc. employees in California following the completion of a $61 billion acquisition that pushed the chipmaker deeper into the software industry.

The cuts will begin Jan. 26 and affect some 1267 positions Broadcom said in a submission to the California Employment Development Department. The jobs are located at VMware’s Palo Alto headquarters which will remain open.

The chipmaker is following its usual pattern of eliminating support roles to cut costs in the wake of takeovers. Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan has built one of the biggest companies in the semiconductor industry through a string of deals which have increasingly focused on software.

Tan’s strategy which has boosted profits and won him support from investors is to identify companies that have strong market share but stunted growth prospects. After purchasing them he consolidates operations — such as sales human resources and other support organizations — to cut costs while trying to retain engineering talent.

VMware has become the centerpiece of Tan’s software operations. He previously built up the division by purchasing CA Technologies and Symantec Corp.’s corporate security business.

VMware founded in 1998 pioneered virtualization programs which allow software to make more efficient use of server computers. The company had about 38300 employees prior to the closing of the transaction according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Broadcom whose other operations include making chips used by companies including Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google will report earnings next week.

The San Francisco Chronicle previously reported that Broadcom would cut more than 1200 workers.

Now that Broadcom has closed its $69 billion acquisition of VMware in one of the biggest tech deals of all time employees and competitors both say it's the end of an era.

Since VMware's founding in 1998 it has been a pioneer in creating virtualization technology and in recent years it has focused more on cloud computing technology. In May 2022 the chip giant Broadcom first announced it would acquire VMware and it closed the deal on November 22 after a year and a half of seeking approval from countries including the US UK and China.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

It's not the first time VMware has gone through an acquisition. EMC acquired VMware in 2004 and VMware subsequently became part of Dell when Dell bought EMC in 2016. In 2021 VMware spun off from Dell. Still under Dell and EMC VMware retained much of its independence and culture.

Under Broadcom employees say the company will not retain the culture it once had and already Broadcom has started making job cuts Business Insider first reported. BI spoke to five VMware workers and one Broadcom employee. They asked to remain anonymous to speak freely and their identities are known to BI.

""There's been uncertainty and doubt that people have thrown out there especially from competitors"" an employee said. ""In the long run I think it's a good deal for VMware but it's changed. Change comes with uncertainty.""

Under Broadcom VMware will operate in four divisions Broadcom CEO Hock Tan told employees last week in an email. In addition Broadcom is now looking into "" strategic alternatives "" to the Carbon Black cybersecurity and End-User Computing units at VMware. Employees say this likely means the businesses will be sold .

""Broadcom has the assets to continue to invest but I also think Broadcom and Hock will bring a pretty clear focus to the core areas that he believes are critical"" an employee said.

Broadcom did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Competitors swoop in

Now that Broadcom has acquired VMware competitors and partners see a big opportunity to win over VMware customers. VMware customers had already been concerned that Broadcom ownership may hurt innovation and cause a talent exodus  while VMware slowed down customer deals BI previously reported.

Many partners had stopped working with VMware and are instead turning to competitors an employee said. For instance they said cloud computing services company Nutanix has ""taken a very aggressive role.""

Many VMware customers have already gone to Nutanix for help and to migrate over said Rajiv Ramaswami Nutanix CEO and former COO at VMware. The acquisition changes the relationship customers have with VMware he said.

Nutanix CEO Rajiv Ramaswami Nutanix

""It creates concern for customers: Whether they potentially have to pay more for the same sort of things they've been getting what kind of support levels they can get from Broadcom running mission-critical applications on VMware and what will happen to the roadmap of innovation"" Ramaswami said.

Likewise Bryan Cantrill co-founder and CTO of Oxide Computer Company says his company stands to benefit from the acquisition. He said he has heard from VMware customers that they're ""really concerned"" and that Broadcom is ""confirming the worst fears"" customers have about the acquisition.

""When Broadcom buys VMware and implies that we're going to increase prices and do that because we have pricing power over customers customers are like 'wait a minute I'm already spending a lot of money on VMware. You're really causing me to go look around'"" Cantrill said. ""That's what we heard from the market.""

""VMware is going to be Broadcom"" he added. ""Broadcom is a company that carries itself differently. The VMware we have known is no more. Employees know that and customers know that.""

VMware layoffs

Broadcom conducted layoffs of VMware employees on Monday. The exact number is unknown although over 1200 Bay Area employees were impacted according to a WARN notice the San Francisco Chronicle first reported on .

Laid-off employees are on a 60-day notice until January 26 according to an impacted employee. Remote employees and contractors were more impacted while product and engineering teams were less impacted workers said.

Impacted employees in the US have been informed if they'll be staying with VMware or not. Many employees in other countries are still waiting to hear their fate depending on local regulations.

For example some contractors and full-time employees in India have been let go or will be receiving a transitional role while employees in Latin America will learn their fates in the first half of December an employee said. Many of these employees are even choosing to leave before they find out what their job status is the employee added.

""They just decided to leave"" the employee said. ""If they get an offer in another place they think it's better to go and take that offer before staying and seeing what's going to happen here.""

More consolidation at VMware is on the way. Tan said in a meeting on Tuesday that he'll shut down offices where business is small and he'll also consolidate sales finance and HR teams.

Broadcom CEO Hock E. Tan Lucas Jackson/Reuters

VMware employees already expected deep cuts before the acquisition as Broadcom has a history of doing this with its past acquisitions such as Symantec and CA Technologies . Employees learned in September that they would either get an offer from Broadcom a transitional role or severance BI first reported.

Employees in a transitional role will stay for about six months and then receive severance an employee said.

Job cuts and offers from Broadcom had already started before the acquisition closed. VMware had also experienced attrition from both executives and rank-and-file employees .

""VMware took good care of employees and that doesn't seem to be the case with Broadcom"" an employee said. ""It is what it is.""

Culture shock at Broadcom

While VMware maintained much of its independence when it was a subsidiary under EMC and Dell employees will face a completely different culture at Broadcom.

VMware is more remote-friendly while Tan said at a meeting Tuesday that he expects employees living within 50 miles to ""get your butt"" to an office unless they're in a customer-facing role. Broadcom also sent employees an email informing them of this change on Thursday.

Some employees are worried about the RTO mandate and this policy change could lead to attrition. An employee hired to work remotely said they'd have to commute in traffic two hours each way if they must return to the office so they'll likely look for another job.

""They're letting a lot of knowledge walk out the door because Broadcom is a return-to-the-office kind of place"" a contractor said.

Additionally Tan said at an internal town hall meeting on Tuesday that the company does not have employee-resource groups for employees who belong to underrepresented groups nor does it do company-wide celebrations.

""VMware is very inclusive. They take good care of the employees"" an employee said. ""Seeing what the CEO expressed about the Broadcom culture seems like they are very different. It's kind of mixed feelings going from VMware to Broadcom.""

A current Broadcom employee said Tan ""takes a long-term view"" and is ""frank and forthright about how he runs the business and what he expects of his staff.""

""I suspect that his direct no-nonsense approach will not appeal to some and his insistence on in-office working for all staff within 50 miles of an office will not go down well"" that employee said. They added that an area where Broadcom ""shines"" is awarding stock options to encourage long-term loyalty.

Still many VMware employees are pessimistic about their company's future.

""It's the end of VMware as far as the VMware culture"" an employee said.

Some employees also felt frustrated with the decision to sell VMware feeling that the deal was just shareholders cashing out.

And with Shanahan who is exacting when it comes to receiver play there were a lot of details.

“He went through all the things he looks for from the start of the route to the intangibles throughout the entire play and the way they finish” Ahmad said. “So as part of that exercise he definitely coached up movement skills: lower-body looseness how they moved their shoulders — all the things that (a scout) needs to go through. I was an area scout at the time. And that drill told me that when I’m on the road I’m going to be looking for this this and this.”

Suffice to say Pearsall has the qualities Shanahan described seven years ago especially the movement skills.”

“Williams joined the 49ers in 2011 as an assistant in the organization’s scouting department. He spent three years (2013-15) as a pro personnel scout. Williams worked the past two seasons as a national scout after five years as an area scout.

Williams attended St. Ignatius College Preparatory in San Francisco before attending Columbia University where he played wide receiver for four years. He earned a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Columbia in 2010.

He joined the 49ers after first working in the financial industry out of college.”

“While Lenoir a former fifth-round pick became a starter in 2022 his true breakout came in 2023 in his third season” wrote Buday. “After recording a 60.9 PFF overall grade in 2022 Lenoir improved to 75.8 in 2023 which ranked 23rd at the position. He also lowered his passer rating allowed number from 89.0 in 2022 to 75.7 this past season.”

“Renardo Green was the star of 49ers rookie minicamp.

He never got targeted and when he faced first-round pick Ricky Pearsall Green blanketed him particularly when playing press man-to-man coverage. Green clearly is a press-man specialist which is a value skill for a cornerback. But in OTAs Green will need to show that he can do more than play press.”

“Brown registered 32 tackles including six for a loss four sacks a pass defensed and a forced fumble through 13 games during his last collegiate season in 2022.”

Russ Curtis a spokesperson for the nonprofit organization International Bird Rescue said the organization has also recovered sick pelicans in Southern California. Since April 20 the organization has cared for more than 235 pelicans at its wildlife rescue centers in Fairfield in the Bay Area and San Pedro in Los Angeles.

“They’re in really poor physical shape. They’re starving and they haven’t gotten enough nutrition” Curtis said in an interview with KQED. Some of the injuries are from fishing lines and hooks.

“When there’s not the fishing stock that they can find they take chances around fishing piers and fishing boats and places where there are people with fishing tackle” he continued.

Sick birds have been spotted off Alameda Point in the Bay Area which is a roosting ground for brown pelicans. But many were found where people usually don’t find these stocky large seabirds. On city streets and parking lots for example. One bird in Santa Cruz attempted to walk into a bar Curtis said. The majority of pelicans at the Fairfield center came from the Monterey and Santa Cruz areas.

It’s not clear why the birds are having trouble finding food.

“It’s still a mystery” Curtis said. “We haven’t had any conclusive proof of what’s really going out in the wild right now.”

The Los Angeles Times reported there was a similar spike in malnourished brown pelicans along California’s coast in 2022 with no clear cause. International Bird Rescue reported other spikes in starving brown pelicans in 2010 and 2012.

During these prior incidents International Bird Rescue cared for pelicans for weeks.

“We’re not going to release them back out to an area where there is not proper fish stock for them to feed on” Curtis said. “They would just rebound and probably come back into care at some point.”

While they wait for more information Curtis said wildlife rescue centers like theirs — which rely on public donations — are feeling a financial squeeze.

“At this point we’re going through about 500 pounds of fish a day just at this center and that’s about $1000 a day” he said.

Curtis said the public can help by keeping an eye out for unwell brown pelicans.

“As you enjoy the warm weather and you’re at the beach or along the coast if you see a pelican that’s out of place or might have a fishing line injury if you see something say something” Curtis said. “Let your local animal control know that there’s a bird in distress and let’s get it into care as soon as we can.”

If you see an injured or unwell pelican you can reach International Bird Rescue’s Bird HelpLine at 866-SOS-BIRD or get help by calling your local animal control.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvY2toYXZlbi5jb20vb2JpdHVhcmllcy8yMDI0LzA1L2phbmV0LWwtYnJvd24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Janet L. Brown | News Sports Jobs - The Express,"Janet L. Brown 87 passed away peacefully on Friday May 10 2024 at Centre Care Rehabilitation and Wellness Services in Bellefonte. She was born on Oct. 6 1936 to the late William “Pete” and Eleanor Stover. She graduated from Hublersburg High School in 1954.

On Oct. 16 1958 Janet married Richard L. Brown who survives at home after sharing over 65 years of marriage together. Together they owned Brown’s Florist and Greenhouse a kiosk at the Nittany Mall and wholesale to vendors for 20 years. During that time they raised two children Melinda and Leon.

The protest organized by the group Brown Divest/Free South Africa was as even members of the university’s Advisory and Executive Committee had to admit “well-organized and impressive.” As a result of their broader campaign which also involved a hunger strike the Brown Corporation voted to divest from companies that did business in South Africa. When the divestment process stalled student organizers kept up the pressure. They were harshly punished with twenty students put on probation in 1987.

On November 8 2023 — thirty-eight years to the day after that initial anti-apartheid protest — the Brown University administration moved to arrest a group of twenty Jewish students peacefully sitting in at the campus’s central building University Hall. The students part of the new group Jews for Ceasefire Now echoed the calls of their predecessors demanding that the university divest from “Israel and the military-industrial complex” and calling for a ceasefire in the besieged Gaza Strip.

Organizers at Brown have been laying the groundwork for the present moment for years. In spring 2019 Brown University students overwhelmingly voted in favor of a referendum that called on the corporation to sever its investments that are “complicit in human rights abuses against Palestinians.” The vote passed with a 69 percent majority and joined the ranks of undergraduate university referendums at Swarthmore NYU and UCLA and others. But since the referendum the Brown Corporation hasn’t moved on divestment. When Brown Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) attended a corporation meeting in 2021 to press board members on divestment the answers they received were hollow: “The corporation is aware of the topic” and divestment is an “issue before the Corporation.”

On November 26 a man shot three Palestinian students in Burlington Vermont. One of them was Brown University junior Hisham Awartani. Awartani and his friends were reportedly wearing keffiyehs and speaking Arabic and the violence is being investigated as a hate crime. At a vigil for Awartani who lay in the hospital injured hundreds of Brown students began chanting in support of divestment and a cease-fire. The issue has now hit closer than ever to home and Brown’s anti-apartheid movement is increasingly determined — even in the face of escalating repression of the student anti-apartheid movement — to make the administration listen.

To be successful anti-apartheid organizers would do well to absorb lessons from the past. James Forman Jr a Yale law professor whose book Locking Up Our Own won the Pulitzer Prize for Nonfiction in 2018 was a highly active member of Brown Divest in the 1980s. In the following interview Forman spoke with Brown student activist Kian Braulik about his experiences operating in and around the divestment movement at Brown University — and the implications for anti-apartheid organizers today.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Jabil Inc. and Builders FirstSource Inc. are set to join too.

San Francisco-based Uber and the latter two companies will replace Sealed Air Corp. Alaska Air Group Inc. and SolarEdge Technologies Inc. in the S&P 500 respectively. The new additions will join the index prior to the market opening on December 18 S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a press release late Friday.

Shares of Uber were up 7.3% in after-hours trading. They’ve gained 132% this year. Shares of manufacturing services company Jabil were up by 4.6% and supplier and manufacturer Builders FirstSource saw post-market gains of close to 7%.

Wall Street analysts had predicted Uber would be added to the index after the company’s third-quarter results showed a second consecutive profitable quarter — a financial viability requirement for inclusion in the benchmark index. Prior to its inclusion Uber was one of the largest US companies eligible to be added to the S&P 500 with a market capitalization of over $118 billion.

Uber’s rideshare business continued to expand faster than analysts expected in the third quarter thanks to improvements in driver supply and trip growth from back-to-school rides and the return of corporate travel. Uber also included new offerings in the past quarter such as partnering with Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo to provide ride-hailing of autonomous vehicles on its app starting in Phoenix. Gross bookings in the mobility or rideshare business jumped 31%.

Uber’s inclusion in the world’s most-watched index will embolden Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi’s mission to focus on profitability said Mandeep Singh technology analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.

“It also establishes Uber’s category leadership position among the gig economy peers"" Singh said adding that scale is “the most important thing"" for any marketplace and Uber has proven it has that both on the demand and supply sides.

To qualify for the S&P 500 companies must be highly liquid US firms with a market capitalization of at least $14.5 billion and must meet profitability liquidity and share-float standards. As of October thresholds for the S&P MidCap 400 Index and S&P SmallCap 600 Index are $5.2 billion to $14.5 billion and $850 million to $5.2 billion respectively.

Additions and removals to the S&P 500 often but not always happen when the index is rebalanced each quarter. They can also occur at other points of the year like after mergers and acquisitions. S&P Dow Jones Indices makes these adjustments to account for shifts in market capitalizations and on occasion to adjust for market gyrations.

Inclusion in the benchmark is becoming more important for companies in a world increasingly dominated by passive investment funds. Furthermore a spot in the coveted S&P 500 boosts a firm’s investor profile and adds to trading liquidity — factors that can potentially propel a company’s stock price higher.

Sourcing skilled labor is still a time-intensive process however and often relies on personal networks and lengthy recruitment efforts. The founders of Gravel want to change that by making it easier to find workers and other construction professionals. The Jakarta-based startup announced today it has raised $14 million.

Investors include New Enterprise Associate (NEA) Marvell Technology Group co-founder Weili Tai Cadence Design System executive chairman Lip-Bu Tan SMDV East Ventures and other strategic investors. Gravel is NEA’s first investment in Southeast Asia. While Gravel is currently focused on Indonesia it plans to enter international markets and will use its funding on business expansion.

Gravel started in 2019 as an app to connect users with construction workers. The platform now has four main features—Gravel Construction for hiring daily construction workers Gravel Borongan for construction with lump sum contracts Gravel Maintenance for on-demand home repairs and Gravel Material for ordering tools and materials.

Gravel says it saw 45x revenue growth between 2020 and 2022 and now has 1.7 million workers on the platform. It has been used for 6000 projects in 20 Indonesian provinces ranging from residential construction to larger ones like LRT Jabadebek (Greater Jakarta Light Rail Transit) Jakarta International Stadium Pelni Hospital and the Keong Man IMAX Theatre.

The startup’s co-founders are chairman Nicholas Sutardja and co-CEOs Georgi Ferdwindra Putra and Fredy Yanto. Before launching Gravel Putra graduated from U.C. Berkeley with a civil and environmental engineering masters and spent time working in the construction industry where he saw challenges with finding labor.

“There were numerous occasions of demand and supply inefficiencies in a large construction project where hundreds of workers were sitting idle getting paid while the project was on short pause and other occasions where additional workers were urgently needed but it took weeks to gather them” he said. Sometimes workers were sent back to their villages to recruit hundreds of additional workers in a time-consuming process. Seeking a solution to the problem Putra and Yanto began working on Gravel with their own funds in 2017 before launching it in 2019 after securing funding.

Skilled labors are often sourced through personal networks or by recruiting large groups of people from the same village who usually work as farmers or fishermen but are hired for short-term projects. On Gravel users are matched with service providers through Gravel’s Personalized Job Feed which the startup says reduces time spent finding the right people from about two weeks to minutes.

Before starting on Gravel workers need to have prior experience. They also go through screening in the form of online tests and skill assessments and periodic training and development sessions.

Daily construction workers are paid within 24 hours after finishing a project through Gravel’s payment system. Putra says quick payment helps workers’ financial resilience in turn improving their performance at work. He adds that other benefits of using Gravel for workers include access to continuous job opportunities workshops and certificate training a loyalty and bonus program and health and well-being support. For service providers meanwhile Gravel can increase their visibility to clients attract a wider scope of projects and work packages give them access to partners and services in their supply and demand chains and more efficient matching to potential clients.

Gravel also includes real-time analysis of project activities that gives an overview into a project’s current stage of construction how many workers it needs and what kinds of materials and equipment are required. This helps with client budget calculations and decision making. Future plans include a predictive model for monitoring construction progress.

In a statement NEA partner and head of Asia Carmen Chang said “Gravel is our first Southeast Asia investment and we’re excited about the company’s potential to elevate Indonesia’s construction industry through technology.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL2tyLWFzaWEuY29tL2RlYWxzLWluLWJyaWVmLWlnbG9vLWFuZC1ncmF2ZWwtc2VjdXJlLWZ1bmRpbmctY29wMjgtcGFydGljaXBhbnRzLXN0ZXAtdXAtZmluYW5jaWFsLWNvbW1pdG1lbnRzLW11bHRpcGxlLWNoaW5hLWluZGlhLWFuZC1taWRkbGUtZWFzdC1kZWFscy1hbmQtbW9yZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deals in brief: Igloo and Gravel secure funding COP28 participants step up financial commitments multiple China ...,"Igloo raises USD 36 million in pre-Series C funding

The insurtech company has announced the completion of its pre-Series C funding round raising USD 36 million. The round was led by Eurazeo utilizing its BNP Paribas Cardif-backed insurtech fund. Openspace Ventures and La Maison existing investors that participated in Igloo’s Series B and Series B+ rounds also took part in this round. Openspace Ventures participated in this round through OSV+ its mid-stage fund focused on Southeast Asia.

Igloo intends to deploy the newly acquired funds for both horizontal and vertical merger and acquisition opportunities. The company plans to expand its workforce by 20% with a specific emphasis on roles in engineering commercial strategy and insurance-focused verticals. Additionally Igloo aims to intensify its efforts in the development of motor health and climate-related products. The funds will also be utilized for advancing initiatives in underwriting and claims digitization as well as exploring artificial intelligence and blockchain technology.

“We have been following Igloo for some time now and have been impressed with [its] evolution into a diversified insurance platform across channels and products. The insurance market in Southeast Asia is still very underpenetrated and we believe Igloo is in a strong position to help solve this by making insurance more easily accessible and understandable for consumers” said Albert Shyy managing director of Eurazeo.

Gravel completes USD 14 million funding round

The Indonesian construction technology company has raised USD 14 million in funding from a slew of investors including New Enterprise Associates (NEA) Weili Dai (Marvell Technology Group) Lip-Bu Tan (Cadence Design System and Walden International) SMDV and East Ventures among others.

In a statement released by Gravel the company shared that it aims to use the newly raised funds to broaden its presence within the global construction technology sector. It is currently engaged in discussions with various companies regarding the utilization of its solutions for potential construction projects. One of these companies include Sinarmas Land the property developer behind the BSD City Kota Deltamas and Grand Wisata development projects.

“In Gravel we see the embodiment of Indonesia’s digital future in construction. As Indonesia actively pursues even distribution of its developmental efforts across all provinces Gravel’s technology emerges as a supporter and a driving force that can substantially amplify this nationwide growth” said Edward Judokusumo principal at SMDV.

COP28 participants step up financial commitments to achieve sustainability goals

The 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference also known as COP28 began on November 30 and its proceedings are scheduled to conclude on December 12.

Global leaders at the conference have been stepping up their commitments to sustainability goals and addressing climate change through various finance-led initiatives. The UAE serving as the host for COP28 is at the forefront of these efforts pledging USD 30 billion to Alterra a new catalytic climate vehicle designed to advance international endeavors for a more equitable climate finance system. Inaugural launch partners for Alterra include BlackRock Brookfield and TPG.

Alterra is poised to become the world’s largest private investment vehicle dedicated to combating climate change with a goal of mobilizing USD 250 billion globally by 2030. It will focus on guiding private markets toward climate investments particularly in transforming emerging markets and developing economies where traditional investment has been lacking.

The investment vehicle will prioritize four key areas aligned with COP28’s action agenda: energy transition industrial decarbonization sustainable living and climate technologies. It will be structured in two parts:

Alterra Acceleration  a USD 25 billion component of Alterra will steer institutional capital toward climate investments with the potential to accelerate the world’s transition to a net zero climate-resilient economy. Alterra Acceleration will serve as an anchor investor and co-investor in climate strategies allocating capital both directly and through fund partnerships to maximize its impact.

Alterra Acceleration will serve as an anchor investor and co-investor in climate strategies allocating capital both directly and through fund partnerships to maximize its impact. Alterra Transformation a USD 5 billion component of Alterra will provide risk mitigation capital to incentivize investment flows into the global south addressing challenges that limit climate investment in this region to broaden access to affordable capital. Alterra Transformation will also strive to create opportunities to leverage concessional finance to further attract climate-focused investment to least developed countries (LDCs) and small island developing states (SIDs).

In addition to Alterra other finance-led initiatives launched during COP28 include:

Green Climate Fund Allied Climate Partners and Allianz Global Investors will collaborate to mobilize USD 5 billion through various blended finance structures. These structures will bring together philanthropies development finance institutions (DFIs) and both the public and private sectors. The primary objective is to unlock a minimum of USD 20 billion expediting the climate transition in emerging markets.

Investcorp has introduced the USD 750 million Climate Solutions Investment Platform in partnership with “Innovate for Climate Tech”—a coalition involving Masdar City Tencent and Catalyst. This platform is dedicated to providing growth capital to companies committed to driving decarbonization and addressing the impacts of climate change.

The Sequoia Climate Foundation has disclosed a USD 450 million investment collectively contributed by leading climate philanthropies in 2023 and the next three years. The funding aims to catalyze the reduction of non-CO2 super climate pollutants with a significant portion directed at methane abatement. The remainder will be allocated to phasing out fluorinated gases nitrous oxide black carbon and ground-level ozone.

The UAE has pledged USD 200 million to enhance the climate resiliency of vulnerable countries. This commitment was announced during the World Climate Action Summit (WCAS) and follows a prior USD 200 million pledge earlier this year in Marrakech to support development in low-income countries. The new commitment will be in the form of special drawing rights (SDRs) allocated to the IMF’s Resilience and Sustainability Trust (RST).

""There is an issue with the sound on my left side"" Carey said into her microphone in front of 13000 fans after an opening rendition of ""Hark! The Herald Angels Sing."" ""This feels like feedback and we don't want to get feedback like that. We like good feedback. How y'all feeling!""

Give a diva a live microphone and stand back. And Friday was a stand back kind of evening as Carey brought a loose off the cuff feeling to her 93-minute performance of Christmas standards catalog hits and of course ""All I Want for Christmas is You"" her 1994 holiday smash that has come to be a perennial Christmas classic and perhaps Carey's definitive song.

That's nothing to scoff at in a catalog as deep as the hitmaker's where it's one of her 19 No. 1 hits the most ever for a solo artist and second only to the Beatles who have one more chart topper than her. But ""All I Want for Christmas is You"" has become so synonymous with Carey and she's become so intertwined with the holiday season that it's worth reminding people from time to time she's one of Earth's most successful singers full stop even without the Christmastime hit.

She's also delightfully funny and her between song stage banter Friday was just as entertaining as her roughly 25-song performance. She said she was looking forward to seeing snow in Detroit but ""it rained instead and that's OK"" she told the crowd in a tone that made it sound like it wasn't OK. She occasionally spoke in a faux-British accent interacting with fans in the front row promising one of them a signature that didn't appear to ever materialize. And when one of those fans held up something that caught her eye she half-played along in the moment. ""I'm not sure what you're showing me"" she said ""but it looks like something fun."" (She also sang an impromptu snippet of ""Miss You Most (at Christmas Time)"" for a couple in the audience who held up a sign saying they shared their first kiss to the 1994 song.)

Just the best really. She was also visited occasionally by an on-stage ""glam squad"" who came and touched up her hair and makeup between songs and Carey's four-piece band added to the unscripted feel of the evening at one point rolling into the instrumental for ""The Roof"" Carey's 1997 track which she laughed off and said ""I don't think we're doing that one tonight."" (They kept playing it anyway and Carey ended up singing a few bars of the sultry love song.)

But Friday night's show wasn't about ""The Roof"" it was about conjuring up the holiday spirit and it was a family-friendly evening that saw children parents and grandparents in attendance in festive sweaters Christmas attire and Santa hats. Carey was more than happy to be the centerpiece of the yuletide celebration mixing her own holiday hits (""Oh Santa"" ""Jesus Born on This Day"" the latter performed with her daughter Monroe) with seasonal favorites (""Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)"" ""Joy to the World"") and even spinning her own ""My All"" into a Christmas-themed gospel number. She sounded great throughout the night her vocals full and clean even if her vaunted ""whistle register"" has lost its ability to shatter glass.

Carey shined in a series of sparkling gowns and came out late in the show for a run of non-Christmas hits including snippets of ""Honey"" (which was mixed with ""Heartbreaker"" in a live mash-up of sorts) ""Fly Like a Bird"" ""Make it Happen"" ""Always Be My Baby"" ""Emotions"" ""It's a Wrap"" and ""A No No."" ""We Belong Together"" and ""Hero"" were given full run-throughs both retaining their thunderous power and representing different peak points of Carey's artistry.

And then there was the show closer that everyone knew was coming ""All I Want for Christmas is You"" which at this point is easy to take for granted. You've heard it in every grocery store dentist's office and holiday party you've been to over the last 30 years but Friday was an important reminder of its world class engineering its inexhaustible energy and its delivery of sheer joy. It has earned its place in the canon just as Carey has. And as she sang it Friday surrounded by dancers as snowflake confetti rained down from the arena ceiling it felt how the Christmas season is supposed to feel: merry festive and bright. Even if it was raining outside.

The proposal currently undergoing scrutiny by community boards borough presidents’ offices and the Planning Commission represents a strategic move to strategically position gambling establishments in specific commercial and manufacturing districts across the city.

Dan Garodnick Chair of the CPC and Director of the Department of City Planning (DCP) underscored the need for fairness in the casino application process within the city. “As the state considers proposals for casinos downstate we must create a level playing field for applicants within New York City so they can compete for this opportunity” he emphasized. The proposed text amendment seeks to simplify the approval process within the city’s zoning regulations while avoiding redundancy with the state’s comprehensive licensing procedures.

Should the proposed changes be approved potential casinos in designated districts across all boroughs would enjoy as-of-right status. Applicants within these zones would only need approval from the state and its Community Advisory Committee to proceed with their projects sidestepping the typically lengthy Uniform Land Use Review Procedure.

This potential shift is particularly promising for developers seeking one of the coveted downstate licenses issued by the New York State Gaming Commission. Notable proposals such as the collaboration between Related Companies and Wynn Resorts in the Hudson Yards align seamlessly with the proposed zoning changes leveraging existing commercial and manufacturing zoning designations.

The citywide initiative aims to ensure that casino applications within New York City remain competitive in the broader state process avoiding any disadvantages compared to those in surrounding counties as reported by Politico. Garodnick explained that the text amendment would prevent duplicating the state’s rigorous licensing process while establishing a rational framework for consideration within the city’s zoning.

The proposal also addresses concerns about a potential influx of individual land use applications from each casino bidder. Under the suggested text amendment gaming facilities with state licenses would be permitted in specified commercial and manufacturing zones deemed compliant with all applicable use and bulk zoning regulations.

Thor Equities’ plan for a gaming house in Coney Island falling within the advantageous C7 zone and Stefan Soloviev’s vision for an entertainment district in the C5-2 zone are among the proposals aligning with the proposed zoning changes.

Several other noteworthy proposals including Point72 Asset Management’s plan near Citi Field in Queens and SL Green Realty Jay-Z’s Roc Nation and Caesars Entertainment‘s proposal for a gaming floor in Times Square also fit seamlessly into the proposed zoning framework.

While several proposals seamlessly fit into the envisioned zoning framework challenges may arise for projects like Steve Cohen and Bally’s in the Bronx facing additional hurdles such as the need for permission to build on parkland according to Crain’s New York Business.

As the seven-month process unfolds the city anticipates a comprehensive restructuring of its zoning regulations potentially heralding a renaissance in the gaming and entertainment landscape across New York City. The proposal’s review by the city’s community boards and borough presidents will precede a vote by the Council next year. The potential shift raises questions about the community’s stance on bringing gambling to Harlem inviting public discussion and opinions on this transformative proposal.

Stocks are heading into year-end on a hot streak with the S&P 500 rising nearly 9% through November alone putting the index up about 19% year-to-date.

That's a far-cry from where many Wall Street pros thought stocks would end the year. Back in January the market's consensus was that a recession was inevitable as interest rate hikes would cut into corporate profits while demolishing consumer's wallets.

“We are concerned that certain syringes manufactured in China may not provide consistent and adequate quality or performance” FDA said in a statement.

Not naming any specific companies the agency said it had received information about quality issues associated with several Chinese manufacturers of plastic syringes including leaks breakage and other problems and recommended that consumers healthcare providers and facilities not use syringes manufactured in the country if possible. If a user only has access to syringes manufactured in China FDA said to continued use as needed until alternative syringes become available but to closely monitor for leaks breakage and other problems. The agency also said it has received Medical Device Reports and other complaints about plastic syringes including problems after manufacturers changed syringe dimensions.

FDA said it is working with federal partners to test syringes manufactured in China as well as manufacturers to ensure adequate corrective actions are being taken. If necessary non-adherence to FDA’s actions may result in the prevention of Chinese-made syringes entering the United States.

The safety communication comes two weeks after the agency issued Class I recall notices to both Cardinal Health and Fresenius Medical care in relation to disposable syringes listing similar quality issues noted in the statement such as leaks and changes to syringe dimensions.

The Cardinal recall pertained to its Monoject single use Luer Lock Syringes which were part of Coviden’s portfolio that the company bought from Medtronic in 2017. In June Cardinal changed the branding of the syringes changing it from Coviden to Cardinal Health. The branding however changed the dimensions of the syringe leading to the recall.

The differing dimensions reportedly affected their use with syringe pumps potentially resulting in pump performance issues like overdose underdose delay in therapy and delays in occlusion alarms. The company has received 15 reports of delayed therapy due to syringe infusion pumps not recognizing syringes and 13 reports of inaccurate volume/rate dispensing including some injuries.

Fresenius also saw its recall marked as Class I after it was found that the Sanxin Single Use Sterile Syringes had the potential to leak blood or heparin back or from the syringe. There were also reports of an unknown black material inside the syringe. Use of the syringes according to FDA could cause serious adverse health consequences including sepsis and blood loss due to leakage or risks like incorrect heparin dosage.

Of note the warning does not currently include glass or pre-filled syringes.

The notice has sparked some companies to issue a statement reiterating that the FDA warning does not impact their products as they are not manufactured in China.

Embecta BD’s diabetes business spinoff is one such company which felt the need to clarify its manufacturing location. In a statement the company noted that it manufactures all of its syringes for worldwide distribution at its Holdrege Nebraska facility according to Shaun Curtis senior vice president of global manufacturing and supply chain.

“The safety notice issued by the FDA on November 30 2023 only applies to plastic syringes made in China and therefore has no impact on the ongoing production or sale of any Embecta syringe products” he said.

Additionally the statement said the company is prepared to support a potential influx of customers affected by FDA’s safety communication.

“Our skilled workforce in Nebraska with its unmatched expertise in high volume syringe manufacturing is prepared to support any healthcare customers who may be affected by the FDA’s safety communication” Curtis said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmtub3huZXdzLmNvbS9vYml0dWFyaWVzL2tuczA2MjY0NdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gary Warren Macquire Obituary,"Gary Warren Macquire passed away on Thanksgiving morning November 23 2023 after a short battle with cancer.

Climate Summit but His Voice Did,"Pope Francis who reluctantly canceled his trip to the annual United Nations climate summit in Dubai United Arab Emirates because of a lung infection sought on Saturday to lend his voice to the world’s destitute facing the brunt of climate disruption.

In an address written by the pope and delivered at the summit by the Vatican secretary of state Cardinal Pietro Parolin Francis assured the world “I am with you because time is short.” He wrote that the world more than ever faced environmental devastation that offended God and “greatly endangers all human beings especially the most vulnerable in our midst and threatens to unleash a conflict between generations.”

Francis 86 in his decade-long pontificate has elevated stewardship of the environment to a top priority of the church. In “Laudate Deum” a letter on humanity’s obligations to the environment issued in October Francis specifically called for tangible solutions at the Dubai meeting which at the time he expected to attend.

But the pope’s health would not permit it. He was prevented not only from delivering the speech in person but also from participating in many bilateral meetings including with leaders of small and vulnerable nations whose plights he had hoped to amplify.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmN0dm5ld3MuY2EvaGVhbHRoL2F2cmlsLWxhdmlnbmUtcmljay1tZXJjZXItY2VsZWJyYXRlZC1hdC1jYW5hZGEtcy13YWxrLW9mLWZhbWUtYW5uaXZlcnNhcnktZ2FsYS0xLjY2NzA2NzTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Avril Lavigne Rick Mercer celebrated at Canada's Walk of Fame anniversary gala,"TORONTO -

Skate punk icon Avril Lavigne reflected on the humble beginnings of her more than two-decade singing career ahead of her induction into Canada's Walk of Fame at a special anniversary gala in Toronto on Saturday.

The singer-songwriter who rose to fame with hits such as ""Complicated"" and ""Sk8er Boi"" said it's especially meaningful to receive the honour for the roots she set down in Canada before she helped usher in an era of female-driven pop-punk music in the early aughts.

""All my family are here. This is where I got my start signing in Napanee Ont. I performed with Shania Twain when I was 14 in Ottawa I did theatre out here so it's an honour to get this award"" she said. ""This is my home. It means so much to me.""

Media personality George Stroumboulopoulos who presented her star said Lavigne had enormous impact on many kids who grew up seeing themselves in her music and persona.

""She never pretended. I remember seeing her back in those early days being really really connected to punk roots ... there was a level of authenticity that's very hard to fabricate"" said Stroumboulopoulos.

""She should get her flowers in front of everybody. To me to be able to be a part of that is lovely.""

The Walk of Fame honouring notable Canadians for excellence in fields spanning from entertainment to humanitarianism celebrated its 25th anniversary at a star-studded event attended by household names like 1972 Summit Series-winning hockey legend Paul Henderson and former prime ministers Stephen Harper and Jean Chretien.

The event was hosted by Drew and Jonathan Scott of ""Property Brothers"" and Juno award-winning singer Deborah Cox who received a star on the Walk of Fame last year.

Political satirist and 2023 inductee Rick Mercer said receiving a star on the Walk of Fame is something he never believed would happen for him.

""For 15 years that I had the TV show I would come out of the subway and walk to the CBC and I would walk along part of the Walk of Fame and say hello to certain people"" Mercer said of being immortalized in Toronto's entertainment district.

""I think things like this happen and it's natural to wonder is it over now? But I've got a few tricks up my sleeve"" he said noting he's still focused on writing after the release of his most recent memoir ""The Road Years.""

Hockey superstar and Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid said he was a little surprised to receive a Walk of Fame star so early in his playing career but said it was an honour to be recognized and represent Canada regardless.

""Moments like these obviously make you kind of step back and reflect a little bit and obviously you have to think about the lasting legacy things that I want to accomplish still.""

The generation-spanning TV franchise ""Degrassi"" was also recognized as cast members from the show's various iterations since 1979 reunited for what creator Linda Schuyler called ""a huge reunion.""

Also commemorated was prolific Cree-Metis actress Tantoo Cardinal who starred in the 1990 Western ""Dances with Wolves"" and in Martin Scorsese's October blockbuster ""Killers of the Flower Moon."" Reflecting on a career that has spanned five decades she said the star gives her a sense of accomplishment in both her contributions to society and Indigenous storytelling.

""There's a lot of healing that's needed to be done in our community and so that's always what I've tried to work with"" said Cardinal.

""I put in my two bits and now the road's open. I'm in a new age and I'm in a new place in my career and a lot of things that I was so concerned about in the early days are no longer a responsibility that I need to hold on to and carry.""

Hip-hop staple Kardinal Offishall was this year's recipient of the Allan Slaight Music Impact Honour. Philanthropist and broadcast industry fixture Gary Slaight will also get a star as will Rosalie Silberman Abella the first Jewish woman appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada. Pioneering neuroscientist Brenda Milner became the oldest living inductee at 105.

Thirteen Canadian rock bands of the 1970s and '80s -- including Glass Tiger and Loverboy -- inducted into the Walk of Fame at a special event in September are also being celebrated.

The 25th anniversary broadcast of Canada's Walk of Fame will air on Dec. 16 on CTV.

“There’s something about light” Tara Krohn says thoughtfully. “There’s just something about light that makes people feel warm and cheerful.”

Krohn would know; she is something of an expert on light. Specifically tacky holiday lights. She and her husband Doug live on Queensgate Road in Midlothian’s Walton Park neighborhood — home of Sports Backers’ annual CarMax Tacky Light Run this year scheduled for Saturday Dec. 9 — and they have been enthusiastic Christmas decorators for “a long long time.”

Tara and Doug met as students at James Madison University where he and his roommate decorated their rental house. “I knew I was marrying into this” she says. The couple first joined the local tacky light circuit when they lived on Patterson Avenue and their display only grew when they moved to Walton Park in 2004.

The family including daughter Riley 17 and son Scott 14 spends about 40 hours decorating each year beginning in early November and working a couple hours each night until their “grand illumination” the Sunday after Thanksgiving. The kids do “as much if not more” than the adults: Scott has claimed a particular tree (“none of us are allowed to help him with it”) while Riley makes one or two new hand-cut and -painted wooden cutouts for Doug’s December birthday each year inspired by a cutout that’s been in the family since the 1950s. “So there’s a lot of tradition” Krohn says. “Every single piece has a story to it or has a meaning to it.”

That enthusiasm is what drew Jon Lugbill executive director of Sports Backers to choose Walton Park for a new race event in 2012. A few years earlier he had realized the abundance of tacky light displays were “one of those very Richmond things that everybody gets really excited about around the holidays” according to Nan Callahan the nonprofit’s public relations and communications manager and he decided to plan an event around them.

After scouting a number of neighborhoods Lugbill found Walton Park which checked all the boxes for a race: plenty of decorated houses streets that could easily be closed for a few hours for the event a nearby area to host the start and finish and a new region to expand the growing organization’s reach. Callahan says Walton Park’s neighborhood association was “immediately excited about the event and really game for it. We got really lucky in that regard.”

The Tacky Light Run is unique among Sports Backers’ array of races which include the iconic Ukrop’s Monument Avenue 10K and the Richmond Marathon. For one thing it’s a 6K (3.7 miles) and includes a detour through a cul de sac — Walton Park’s Dawnridge Court is known as Christmas Court in December. Callahan says the event isn’t timed (“it’s more of a fun run”) and at least half the participants walk some pushing strollers which aren’t allowed at other Sports Backers events. And of course the run — or walk — happens at night so participants can appreciate the full glory of the light displays.

Participants start and finish at Mid-Lothian Mines Park which Sports Backers transforms into the “North Pole” for the evening. “We go big on the start line. It is over-the-top tacky” Callahan says. “We are on-site for the entire week adding decorations to the park and to the course … and we strap every light you can find on this giant star structure. It gets kind of wild. There's candy canes flamingos — just tons of stuff.” The North Pole after-party includes themed photo props provided by race sponsor CarMax (“They love this event they love being a part of it” Callahan notes) a DJ hot chocolate and food vendors.

Out on the course it’s one big costume party complete with prizes and a cookie stop. At the very least Callahan says participants wear “Christmas light necklaces; antlers; light-up Santa hats; ugly tacky sweaters.” She has seen runners dressed as the cast of “The Grinch Who Stole Christmas” a group who built a sleigh to portray “Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer” and even a gingerbread house costume. “I think this is what makes it such a fun walking event. You can’t really run in a gingerbread house costume” Callahan says with a laugh “and even if you can people are going to want to slow down and take pictures with you and look at your costume.”

Plus she says “The neighborhood really comes out hard.” Families decorate their driveways and host bonfires live bands selfie stops and refreshments. Awards for the neighborhood include “Overall Tackiest” “Most Likely to Blow a Fuse” and “Best & Loudest Block Party.”

From the homeowners’ point of view Krohn says “The Tacky Light Run brings the entire neighborhood together. It brings everybody out of their homes. … I’m known for yelling at the runners to ‘Slow down take it all in get your money’s worth.’ I’ve never quite understood why people run it because there’s so much to see. It’s a feast for your eyes.

“I just love seeing the costumes and the creativity and the positivity” she continues. “And it is the greatest compliment when a group of people stops and they want to get a selfie in front of your house or take a picture of your house. It means the world because so much heart and soul have been invested into it time and energy and they’re basically giving that gift back to us by appreciating it.

“It’s the best night of the year.”

Booked guests do have a few days to lock in lower rates if they pre-pay for an internet package before the rate increase takes effect.

Internet Prices Increasing on All Carnival Cruise Ships

Carnival Cruise Line has emailed booked guests and affiliated travel partners to alert them to an upcoming increase in Wi-Fi internet packages across the Carnival fleet with new pricing starting on Friday December 8 2023.

All package prices will increase for both pre-cruise and onboard purchases. The rate changes are as follows (all in USD):

Social Plan

This is Carnival’s least expensive plan allowing guests to stay connected to family and friends back home via social media and apps including Facebook Snapchat Instagram and several others. This plan also includes access to the most popular airline websites in case travelers need to check in for flights or make travel arrangements.

Current pricing is $12.75 per day when purchased before sailing or $15 per day when purchased onboard. From December 8 the rate will increase to a pre-cruise price of $15.30 per day and $18 per day when purchased onboard an increase of 20% regardless of when the package is purchased.

Guests should note that the Social Plan does not include access to email streaming services video chats or most websites.

Value Plan

The most popular Wi-Fi plan is the Value Plan which includes not only social media and airline websites but also news sports weather banking and entertainment sites – though not streaming services. The speed for the package is faster and guests can easily post pictures using the Value Plan.

Cruise Wi-Fi

Before the increase this plan is $17.00 per day when purchased pre-cruise or $20.00 per day when purchased onboard. After December 8 the price will increase to $19.55 per day when bought before sailing or $23.00 per day when bought onboard after embarkation. This is an increase of 15% over the current pricing.

Premium Plan

The fasted internet speeds with the most access to social networking email websites and apps including several types of video calling and conferencing the Premium Plan is a great option for passengers who must stay connected while at sea either for their own enjoyment or for some work requirements or other obligations though video and music streaming are still not supported.

Currently Carnival’s Premium Wi-Fi Plan is available for $18.70 per day before cruises or $22.00 per day onboard. From December 8 the new pricing will be $21.25 per day for pre-cruise purchases or $25 per day when purchased onboard the ship. Either way this is a 13.6% increase for the package price.

Savings Can Be Locked In

Booked guests – or those who complete a booking prior to Friday December 8 – can still lock in the lower rates by pre-paying for internet packages before the rate increase goes into effect regardless of when their cruise sets sail.

“Make sure to add your Wi-Fi package early to lock in the current package price for your upcoming cruise” the notification email read.

Pre-booking before the price increase can be a significant savings depending on the package travelers choose and the length of their sailing as longer cruises and stronger internet packages command higher savings.

Carnival cancelled a number of cruises on the ship to fix a propulsion issue having secured a shipyard slot in Portland and OEM manufacturer help and logistics.

Meanwhile to get to the Portland shipyard the 2019-built Panorama first had to visit Victoria Canada to have most of its funnel removed.

Following the drydock in Portland the ship will then head back to Victoria to have its funnel re-installed and then be ready to resume revenue service from Long Beach later this month with a Dec. 23 holiday cruise.

(CRUISE RADIO)

Carnival’s brand ambassador John Heald said on his Facebook page “I wanted to let you know that we are rolling out a new debarkation system for those guests who put their luggage outside of their cabin door and want to choose what time they will disembark.”

How does Digital Debark work?

(CARNIVAL)

Instead of picking up zone tags for their luggage guests can indicate a debarkation time via the app and list the number of bags to be placed outside the stateroom.

Tags will then be delivered directly to guests. They can still use the self-assist debarkation option and carry their luggage off the ship themselves.

Diamond Platinum Faster to the Fun and Suite guests will still receive special tags with priority debarkation as normal.

No smartphone no problem

Guests who prefer not to use the app or do not have a smartphone can follow the traditional debarkation process and retrieve their tags.

The debarkation talk will still be held on the last full day of the cruise for passengers with questions about the new process.

Multiple ships are testing

(CRUISE RADIO)

Digital Debark is being tested on Carnival Spirit Carnival Conquest Carnival Dream and Carnival Elation. According to Carnival Cruise Line Brand Ambassador John Heald it will be rolled out on more ships over time adding additional features if necessary.

Heald says the ultimate aim is to phase out the need to collect luggage tags and make the process smoother. Further updates and information about the Digital Debark system will be shared in the future.

Initial reports are that the new debarkation process is generally efficient with scheduled timings to reduce passenger congestion.

It should be noted that wait times for passengers leaving the ship can be unpredictable due to factors beyond the cruise line’s control such as immigration and passport control.

Gilliam summarized the plot as: “God wipes out humanity and the only character who wants to save them is Satan and Johnny Depp plays Satan.”

Gilliam was attending the screening at Red Sea of a double bill of the documentaries “Lost in La Mancha” and “He Dreams of Giants” both of which document Gilliam’s cursed and grueling attempt to make the film “The Man Who Killed Don Quixote.” The film ultimately premiered in Cannes in 2018 starring Jonathan Pryce and Adam Driver.

The producer of the documentaries Lucy Darwin was also on stage with Gilliam to explain to the audience how she went from being a publicist on “The Adventures of Baron Munchausen” to a producer via Gilliam’s encouragement. She also told fans that “Lost in La Mancha” was being premiered in a newly restored version at the festival.

Popular on Variety

Talking to Variety after the screening Gilliam at first joked: “Ah you’re the magazine that killed me!” referring to an incident when the magazine prematurely published his obituary in 2015. After suggesting the magazine buy him a couple of bottles of wine to make up for the distress caused to some family members the publishers sent him a couple of crates and peace reigned.

As for the new film it is being co-written with performer theater-maker writer and musician Christopher Brett Bailey whose relative youth is an asset to Gilliam “because as you get older the world becomes more foreign to you.” The story is as wild as you’d expect from the creator of “12 Monkeys” and “Brazil.”

“This is a simple tale of God wiping out humanity for fucking up his beautiful garden Earth” Gilliam said. “There’s only one character who’s trying to save humanity and that’s Satan because without humanity he’s lost his job and he’s an eternal character and so to live without a job is terrible. So he finds some young people and he tries to convince God that these young people are the new Adam and Eve. God still gets to wipe out humanity. It’s a comedy.”

Which is where Depp comes in. Though the film is still at an early stage Gilliam feels confident. He also noted that his name in “Lost in La Mancha” appears above that of Depp. “I have to keep him in his place” he joked."

It has not given details of any proposal and points out that the contact is preliminary.

Israir Group states that it examines applications for “various business opportunities” from companies and entities “from time to time”.

It adds that should any of these progress to the stage of advanced negotiations it will provide further information.

Israeli flag-carrier El Al had previously entered talks with Arkia two years ago regarding the possibility of taking over the holiday airline.

El Al had considered acquiring Arkia to turn it into a subsidiary operator.

But an exclusivity period for the discussions did not yield a formal proposal.

Arkia is controlled by the Nakash brothers. Like Israir it operates Airbus single-aisle jets and also has a small fleet of Embraer 195s.

Three years ago Arkia had participated in an auction for Israir which at the time was being sold as part of a restructuring of its parent company.

Arkia had sought to pursue Israir through a merger stating that a tie-up offered an opportunity to consolidate the Israeli aviation sector which was under pressure from increasing foreign competition.

Israir was ultimately acquired by Israeli firm BGI Investments under which it has been exploring a takeover of Czech carrier Smartwings.

El Al has also previously attempted an Israir merger with a view to combining it will its Sun D’Or charter division but the flag-carrier’s tie-up proposal was eventually rejected by Israeli competition regulators.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmM2Zi5uYXZ5Lm1pbC9QcmVzcy1Sb29tL05ld3MvTmV3cy1EaXNwbGF5L0FydGljbGUvMzYwNDY4My90aGUtd29ybGRzLWxhcmdlc3QtYWlyY3JhZnQtY2Fycmllci1hcnJpdmVzLWluLXNvdWRhLWJheS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The World's Largest Aircraft Carrier Arrives in Souda Bay,"The U.S. Navy’s newest aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) and embarked staff from Carrier Strike Group (CSG) 12 arrived in Souda Bay Crete for a scheduled port visit Dec 2 2023.

This port visit is the capital ship’s sixth stop while deployed to the U.S. Naval Forces Europe (NAVEUR) area of operations. The port call will offer Gerald R. Ford Sailors the opportunity to experience the rich history and culture of Greece and enhance the strong partnership between the U.S. and Greece.

“The crew has been laser-focused on the mission and I am really proud of our Sailors’ work and efforts these past couple of months as our nation’s capital ship has remained on scene and prepared to do our duty” said Capt. Rick Burgess Commanding Officer of Gerald R. Ford. “The team has earned some time off and looks forward to taking in Greek culture and exploring Souda Bay Chania and the surrounding area. Earlier this summer Gerald R. Ford visited Piraeus and Athens and the port visit remains one of the highlights of our deployment because of the hospitality of our cherished Ally.”

The U.S. Navy routinely operates with Greece sending its largest aircraft carrier in the fleet to Souda Bay just four months after it visited Piraeus. Since Piraeus the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group (GRFCSG) conducted three steaming exercises with the Hellenic Navy and hosted the commanding officers of HS Elli (F-450) and HS Psara (F-454) aboard the flagship Gerald R. Ford. On Nov. 28 Psara joined the strike group to conduct joint and combined training in the Mediterranean Sea.

Gerald R. Ford’s most recent port visit in theater was in Trieste Italy Sept. 17-21. The ship deployed from Norfolk Virginia on May 2 and has been conducting training exercises and operations to support maritime stability and security in defense of U.S. Allied and partner interests.

Gerald R. Ford is the U.S. Navy’s newest and most advanced aircraft carrier. As the first-in-class ship of Ford-class aircraft carriers CVN 78 represents a generational leap in the U.S. Navy’s capacity to project power on a global scale. Ford-class aircraft carriers introduce 23 new technologies including Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System Advanced Arresting Gear and Advanced Weapons Elevators. The new systems incorporated onto Ford-class ships are designed to deliver greater lethality survivability and joint interoperability with a 20% smaller crew than a Nimitz-class carrier paving the way forward for naval aviation.

The Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group (GRFCSG) is conducting a scheduled deployment in U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa/U.S. Sixth Fleet area of operations demonstrating the commitment and power projection capability of the Navy’s globally deployed force. The GRFCSG provides an inherently flexible naval force capable of deploying across combatant commands to meet emerging missions deter potential adversaries reassure allies and partners enhance security and guarantee the free flow of global commerce. In total the GRFCSG is deployed with more than 6000 Sailors across all platforms ready to respond globally to combatant commander tasking.

The Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group consists of Carrier Strike Group 12 Carrier Air Wing 8 Destroyer Squadron 2 USS Normandy (CG 60) USS Ramage (DDG 61) USS McFaul (DDG 74) and USS Thomas Hudner (DDG 116).

Headquartered in Naples Italy U.S. Naval Forces Europe-Africa/U.S. Sixth Fleet operates U.S. naval forces in the U.S. European Command (USEUCOM) and U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) areas of responsibility. U.S. Sixth Fleet is permanently assigned to NAVEUR-NAVAF and employs maritime forces through the full spectrum of joint and naval operations. Our persistent presence in Europe is in accordance with our international commitments and agreements and is necessary to reassure our Allies and Partners of our commitment to collective defense.

The investment supports the company’s growing aviation fleet with a 305000- square-foot state-of-the-art aviation maintenance facility with additional space for aircraft components storage offices three maintenance parking gates and eight new aircraft gates.

More than 1000 DHL Teamsters at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG) voted Sunday to authorize a strike – a vote allows the DHL Teamsters Negotiating Committee to call for a work stoppage at any time as the carrier and union work on a contract covering 1100 ramp and tug workers. The members of Teamsters Local 100 load and unload airplanes at DHL's largest and busiest logistics hub in North America.

The Teamsters represent more than 6000 members at DHL (CCJ Top 250 No. 35) in the U.S. and seeks to organize more of DHL's U.S. workforce. Teamsters at Northeast Transportation Services — a third-party contractor for DHL Express – endured a seven-month long strike that ended in February this year.

DHL ramp and tug workers joined the Teamsters in April and the Teamsters Negotiating Committee has been bargaining with DHL since July. Local 100 has also filed unfair labor practice charges against DHL with the National Labor Relations Board.

""DHL Express is in ongoing contract negotiations with the Teamsters representing a portion of our employees at our Cincinnati (CVG) Global Hub"" the company told CCJ via emailed statement Sunday afternoon. ""While it is unfortunate the U.S. Teamsters have decided to increase the external rhetoric and communicate inaccuracies around the status of these CVG Hub negotiations we have consistently sought to bargain in good faith and to find constructive solutions at the negotiating table. Their latest decision was anticipated and a situation for which we are fully prepared.""

DHL Express has activated an initial phase of contingency plans to limit business disruptions caused by a strike threat including activating supplemental staff at CVG and temporarily moving volume away from CVG to other key strategic DHL locations throughout the Americas Region. ""We are confident these prudent and proactive measures will ensure we maintain our high level of delivery standards and performance for our customers in their most critical peak period of the year. We expect no disruption to services"" the company said.

Teamsters claim DHL has told the union it will not schedule negotiations this year after Dec. 7. DHL told CCJ Sunday that there is no agreed deadline for contract negotiations adding ""we are committed to working in good faith at the December negotiating sessions and have offered further negotiating dates in January to conclude this matter.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vbnkxLmNvbS9ueWMvYWxsLWJvcm91Z2hzL2ludGVybmF0aW9uYWwvMjAyMy8xMi8wMy9wZW50YWdvbi11cy13YXJzaGlwLWF0dGFjay1yZWQtc2Vh0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Pentagon says U.S. warship commercial ships attacked in Red Sea,"An American warship and multiple commercial ships came under attack Sunday in the Red Sea the Pentagon said. Yemen's Houthi rebels later claimed attacks on two ships they described as being linked to Israel but did not acknowledge targeting a U.S. Navy vessel.

What You Need To Know The Pentagon says an American warship and multiple commercial ships have come under attack in the Red Sea The attack Sunday potentially marks a major escalation in a series of maritime attacks in the Mideast linked to the Israel-Hamas war The Pentagon tells The Associated Press: “We’re aware of reports regarding attacks on the USS Carney and commercial vessels in the Red Sea and will provide information as it becomes available” The British military earlier said there had been a suspected drone attack and explosions in the Red Sea without elaborating The Pentagon did not identify where it believed the fire came from. However Yemen’s Houthi rebels have been launching a series of attacks on vessels in the Red Sea

The attack potentially marked a major escalation in a series of maritime attacks in the Mideast linked to the Israel-Hamas war.

“We’re aware of reports regarding attacks on the USS Carney and commercial vessels in the Red Sea and will provide information as it becomes available” the Pentagon told The Associated Press.

The Carney is an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. It remained unclear what damage if any the vessels sustained in the attacks.

The British military earlier said there had been a suspected drone attack and explosions in the Red Sea without elaborating.

The Pentagon did not identify where it believed the fire came from. However Houthi military spokesman Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree claimed the attacks saying the first vessel was hit by a missile and the second by a drone while in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait that links the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. He described the ships as allegedly ignoring warnings from Houthi officials prior to the attack.

Saree did not mention any U.S. warship being involved in the attack.

“The Yemeni armed forces continue to prevent Israeli ships from navigating the Red Sea (and Gulf of Aden) until the Israeli aggression against our steadfast brothers in the Gaza Strip stops” Saree said. “The Yemeni armed forces renew their warning to all Israeli ships or those associated with Israelis that they will become a legitimate target if they violate what is stated in this statement.”

Saree identified the first vessel attacked as the Bahamas-flagged bulk carrier Unity Explorer which is owned by a British firm that includes Dan David Ungar who lives in Israel as one of its officers. The second was a Panamanian-flagged container ship called Number 9 which is linked to Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement. Managers for the two vessels could not be immediately reached for comment.

Israeli media identified Ungar as being the son of Israeli shipping billionaire Abraham “Rami” Ungar.

The Houthis have been launching a series of attacks on vessels in the Red Sea as well as launching drones and missiles targeting Israel amid the war.

A U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters said the attack began about 10 a.m. in Sanaa Yemen and had gone on for as much as five hours. Another U.S. official who similarly spoke on condition of anonymity for the same reason said the Carney had intercepted at least one drone during the attack.

Global shipping had increasingly been targeted as the Israel-Hamas war threatens to become a wider regional conflict — even as a truce briefly halted fighting and Hamas exchanged hostages for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. However the collapse of the truce and the resumption of punishing Israeli airstrikes and its ground offensive there had raised the risk of the seaborne attacks resuming.

Earlier in November the Houthis seized a vehicle transport ship also linked to Israel in the Red Sea off Yemen. The rebels still hold the vessel near the port city of Hodeida. Missiles also landed near another U.S. warship last week after it assisted a vessel linked to Israel that had briefly been seized by gunmen.

However the Houthis had not directly targeted the Americans for some time further raising the stakes in the growing maritime conflict. In 2016 the U.S. launched Tomahawk cruise missiles that destroyed three coastal radar sites in Houthi-controlled territory to retaliate for missiles being fired at U.S. Navy ships at the time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2JyaXRhaW5zLW1hcml0aW1lLWFnZW5jeS1yZXBvcnRzLXBvdGVudGlhbC1leHBsb3Npb24tcmVkLXNlYS0yMDIzLTEyLTAzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Multiple commercial vessels attacked in Red Sea,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/britains-maritime-agency-reports-potential-explosion-red-sea-2023-12-03/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL2JyaXRhaW5zLW1hcml0aW1lLWFnZW5jeS1yZXBvcnRzLXBvdGVudGlhbC1leHBsb3Npb24tcmVkLXNlYS0yMDIzLTEyLTAzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Certain members of that expedition spent the better part of a year on this remote Siberian island after their ship was crushed by ice and Captain Bob Bartlett played Chopin’s “Funeral March” on his Victrola to accompany its sinking. Those who survived their lengthy stay on Wrangel were rescued by the Canadian schooner King and Winge in September of the following year.

Near Cape Litke I happened to see not a tattered glove from one of the Karluk’s castaways but an arctic woolly bear caterpillar (Gynaephora groenlandica) basking on a small rock and looking like it didn’t have a care in the world. This isn’t the same species as the temperate woolly bear (Pyrrharctia isabella) which is commonly thought to predict winter weather — the thicker its brown stripes the warmer the winter will be. Rather it was an endemic High Arctic species that doesn’t predict winter weather so much as triumph over it.

I kneeled to get a closer look at this tan-brown thumb-sized creature. The temperature was slightly below freezing and like me it was wearing a parka. Or I should say it was covered with the equivalent of a parka — thick bristly hairs called setae that provide it with external insulation and help it absorb as well as retain heat.

A clever sunbather

Speaking of heat retention the caterpillar can raise its body temperature 42˚C (75˚F) above the air simply by basking in the sun. It does this basking much of the time when it’s not feeding or searching for food. No high-intensity workouts for it! As the summer progresses it becomes increasingly chubby since chubbiness is a good survival morphology in the Arctic.

Quite a few members of the Karluk Expedition suffered from hypothermia

during their time on Wrangel. If an arctic woolly bear caterpillar could talk it

might have said “Try to synthesize some glycerol guys” to these shivering men. Glycerol is a compound that the caterpillar manufactures to keep its body cavity from freezing.

Several members of the Karluk Expedition also ended up with Hypervitaminosis A from eating polar bear liver. As a result they suffered from fatigue and nausea along with bits of their skin peeling off. If the caterpillar had been able to talk it might have said “Eat arctic willow leaves” to these distressed individuals. For the buds and leaves of this creeping shrub (Salix arctica) are its primary food from June until mid-July after which the buds are gone and the leaves turn yellow and lack nutrients.

Voluntary hypothermia

In late summer the caterpillar heads down to a sheltered site close to the permafrost and creates a silken hibernaculum as its winter home. Then it undergoes what Olga Kukal the world’s leading G. groenlandica expert calls “voluntary hypothermia.” Frozen solid like a popsicle it has no worries except for the occasional parasitoid wasp or fly that overwinters as a larva inside it and while doing so feeds on it.

Come spring the caterpillar thaws itself out and again begins to eat arctic willow buds and leaves or if none of these are around on purple saxifrage leaves. By contrast I suspect that if Sir John Franklin’s doubtless frozen body is ever found and thawed out the result would be a foul-smelling heap of carrion incapable of eating a ship’s biscuit or even an Arctic willow leaf.

The first person to spend any time studying arctic woolly bears was James Ross (1800-1862) the naturalist on his uncle Sir John Ross’s 1829 Arctic expedition. Best known for his discovery of the Magnetic North Pole James Ross collected a number of frozen woolly bears on Fury Island in the Gulf of Boothia. He brought them into the expedition’s warm cabin where (he wrote) “every one of them returned to life and continued walking about…”

Survives for 14 winters

Ross probably didn’t realize that the caterpillar freezes and thaws each

year for a remarkable 14 years. And whatever the lowest temperature might have been on his uncle’s expedition it wouldn’t have been nearly as low as the temperature the woolly bear is able to tolerate. What would that temperature be you might wonder? At least -71˚C (-95˚F)!

After 14 years the caterpillar has gotten enough resources to pupate and become an arctic woolly bear moth. Compared to a luna moth or a monarch butterfly this grayish-black moth isn’t a particularly attractive lepidopteran. But what matters to it is not beauty but sex — it must find a mate and lay eggs in a short time because its life span is no more than two weeks. That the moth unlike the caterpillar isn’t frost-proof makes it all the more eager to find a mate.

Back to the caterpillar. You would expect it to be present in Inuit folklore given its seemingly folklorish behavior. Might there be a story about a woman who marries a G. groenlandica because it’s much braver than any man she knows? I never heard such a story nor did I hear any lore about arctic woolly bear quklurriat (caterpillars) during my meetings with Inuit.

Actually I did hear one tidbit of lore. In Upernavik West Greenland I once met an Inuk who told me his father wore a neck amulet with an arctic woolly bear encased in it. Since the caterpillar can survive extremely frigid conditions his father figured this amulet might help him do so too. And it worked the fellow said with a grin. For shortly after he created the amulet the government moved his father from a poorly heated turf hut to a well-heated home for elders.

In the end I didn’t find a single relic from the Karluk Expedition. But I did find something perhaps more interesting than a relic — a furry little creature far better adapted to the cold than almost any other insect not to mention most members of my own species.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3MxOC5jb20vdmlyYWwvZG9udC1ibGluay1lbHNlLXlvdS1taXNzLXRoaXMtY2F0ZXJwaWxsYXJzLXN1cGVyZmFzdC1odW50aW5nLXNraWxscy04Njg3NTg0Lmh0bWzSAXFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdzMTguY29tL2FtcC92aXJhbC9kb250LWJsaW5rLWVsc2UteW91LW1pc3MtdGhpcy1jYXRlcnBpbGxhcnMtc3VwZXJmYXN0LWh1bnRpbmctc2tpbGxzLTg2ODc1ODQuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Don't Blink Else You Miss This Caterpillar's Superfast Hunting Skills,"Caterpillars are the larval stages of the moths and butterflies. They usually eat leaves and other plants to stay alive. There are also carnivorous caterpillars that exclusively eat spiders and insects. These are some rare species of the caterpillars. They belong to a large group of moths called Eupithecia. They follow a predator lifestyle and have raptorial legs which helps them clinch the branches of the trees. Recently Nat Geo uploaded a video of this caterpillar in its natural habitat hunting its prey. The netizens are shocked to see the reflexes of this predator. Some called it a dangerous predator while others listed it as the outcome of evolution.

In the latest trending video the caterpillar was found hunting an insect with its claws. The physical features and the process of hunting by this predator are explained. He sticks to the trees with the help of the hooks on his legs. It secretly waits for its prey and ambushes them with its six frontal claws after they come within its range. The accuracy with which the caterpillar attacks its prey is mind-blowing. It happens faster than the blink of an eye. It first catches the prey and then slowly feeds on them.

These caterpillars belong to the genus Eupithecia. There are several species under it. One of them is the caterpillar of the harvester butterfly. It is often found in North America. It mostly feeds on aphids and woolly alder aphids. As they are larvae the caterpillars pierce and suck the fluids of their prey. Their hunting is similar to the hunting process of spiders.

Moving to moths the pearly-winged lichen moth is the only moth species in North America that has a carnivorous caterpillar. They are usually found feeding on lichens mosses and algae. However they also feed on small insects and spiders that they encounter.

Cuthbert made a surprise guest appearance at the match cheering on Yeovil from the side-lines with plenty of comical chants on the day that Aldi also appeared as official shirt sponsor of The Glovers for the fixture in a one-off cup match partnership.

Cuthbert’s on-pitch appearance added another layer of tension and excitement to the cup tie given Wrexham’s recent partnership announcement with M&S - who have their own caterpillar Colin.

The partnership has caused quite the commotion on social media with Aldi’s Twitter post announcing the appearance gaining 500 likes in the first hour of it being live.

The situation has had shoppers in stitches with one Twitter user saying ‘Absolute legends- #teamcuthbert’ while another exclaimed ‘it’s the caterpillar derby!’.

An Aldi spokesperson said: “Cuthbert is a huge football fan and given the opponents we put the feelers out to become Yeovil’s official mascot for this cup tie and the rest is history.

""Cuthbert loved being part of the action and was thrilled to cheer on The Glovers from the sidelines”.

But the real winners on the day were Wrexham who advanced to the third round of the FA Cup for a second year running.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9mb290YmFsbC9hcnRpY2xlLTEyODE5OTgxL1dyZXhoYW0tWWVvdmlsLXVubGlrZWx5LXJpdmFscnkuaHRtbNIBZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay9zcG9ydC9mb290YmFsbC9hcnRpY2xlLTEyODE5OTgxL2FtcC9XcmV4aGFtLVllb3ZpbC11bmxpa2VseS1yaXZhbHJ5Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wrexham and Yeovil form unlikely rivalry as Non-League side seal sponsorship deal with Aldi days before FA Cup,"Wrexham and Yeovil appear to have forged an unlikely rivalry after Aldi sponsored the Non-League side right before the FA Cup fixture.

The two teams will do battle in the second round of the competition on Sunday at Wrexham's Racecourse Ground in north Wales as Phil Parkinson's side continue to push for their Hollywood dream of success.

A win could earn the club owned by actors Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney a lucrative draw in round three that could see them receive even more global coverage than they have picked up since the takeover.

Yeovil - and Aldi - want in on the plan though with the supermarket chain sealing an impromptu agreement to sponsor the club for the game which will be broadcast on ITVX and ESPN+ in the United States.

And the reason is likely because Wrexham agreed a bumper three-year deal with M&S Food in November meaning the two supermarkets will once again battle off-the-field with M&S dealing the first blow.

Yeovil posted on X on Sunday morning that their mascot the Jolly Green Giant has been banned from leading Yeovil out ahead of the match donning its new Aldi kit.

'Unfortunately we've been refused permission for our mascots to lead out the team today' they posted. 'However you can still catch them at the ground before the game. #notsojolly #freecuthbert #YTFC.'

The use of the hashtag 'free Cuthbert' refers to the battle the two shops had a few months ago regarding a caterpillar cake with M&S angered by Aldi's introduction of Cuthbert the Caterpillar.

M&S have proudly sold their Colin the Caterpillar dessert for many years and went back-and-forth with their rivals both on social media also launching a lawsuit which was unsuccessful.

Wrexham responded with a picture of a blow-up Percy Pig with the caption: 'Not just any FA Cup tie... Watch your back Cuthbert. #WxmAFC #TeamColin #TeamPercy'

Wrexham posted prior to the agreement that 'hundreds' of Percy Pig and Colin the Caterpillar soft toys had attended a match sharing: ' Ok we're not sure if Wrexham A.F.C have played in front of a crowd quite like this before...

'Hundreds of our NEW Percy Pig and Colin the Caterpillar soft toys attended Wrexham's most recent game and it's fair to say they absolutely loved it!'

One worried gardener recently came to r/vegetablegardening for advice when they found a visitor that no plant-loving person wants to see: a hornworm.

Photo Credit: u/superxero044 / Reddit

""Hornworms"" are green caterpillars with spiky tails according to the University of Minnesota. They're known scientifically as the caterpillar version of the Manduca quinquemaculata or the five-spotted hawkmoth. Hawkmoths are some of the largest species of moths in the world and their caterpillars are appropriately large measuring up to four inches long.

A bug that big has to eat and their favorite food is tomato plants. They can strip all the leaves off a tomato plant and even chew holes in the growing fruit.

The concerned Redditor posted a picture of the chubby green caterpillar clinging to a branch of unripe tomatoes two of which were already half-eaten. They already knew what they were seeing and they had only one question for Reddit: ""Are there more?""

Sadly that seemed very likely to the commenters.

""Where there is one there are always more"" wrote one user.

The community also warned the concerned gardener to act fast. ""A single hornworm completely destroyed one of my tomato plants in one night"" said one commenter. ""The thieving little monster got what it deserved though — I fed it to my chickens.""

According to the University of Minnesota the most effective way to get rid of existing hornworms is simply to find them and pick them off the plants. Some people drop them in soapy water to kill them but since their adult form is great for pollinating plants you can also simply move them to a different area.

While their large size and slow movement make that possible their bright green color is perfect for blending in with tomato plants making it easy to miss one.

Luckily r/vegetablegardening came to the rescue. ""Fun fact"" said one helpful user. ""Hornworms are fluorescent under UV lights. This means the pee stain detection flashlight in the local pet store shows these buggers at night.""

""Nice"" said the original poster. ""I ordered a blacklight flashlight on Amazon. Thanks.""

How Google tapped Earths heat to power its data centres

Google in partnership with clean-energy startup Fervo has achieved an important milestone in its goal to operate data centers on 24/7 carbon-free energy. The company has successfully harnessed geothermal energy tapping into the Earth's crust to generate electricity without burning fossil fuels or releasing carbon. This innovative approach complements variable renewables like solar and wind bringing the grid closer to operating on continuous carbon-free energy. Fervo used drilling techniques from the oil and gas industry to harness heat utilizing two horizontal wells at Google's Nevada data center site. This geothermal plant produces round-the-clock clean energy requiring less land compared to other sources.

The subsidy for the current year is around Rs 2 lakh crore. The government will ensure no shortage of funds for grain procurement. Additionally the One Nation One Ration Card scheme has been implemented to allow poor beneficiaries to avail the scheme nationwide.

Kolkata: Coldwell Banker Richard Ellis ( CBRE ) South Asia is planning to attract investors for the development of a data centre hub in the city.“The data centre sector is growing in India and several such centres are also coming up in Kolkata.

Lyda Hill the 81-year-old granddaughter of wildcatter H.L. Hunt has funneled millions of philanthropic and investment dollars into developing the industry in her hometown. In September her marquee project an office campus modeled after the Kendall Square innovation district near MIT scored a big win when it was named one of the three headquarters for the federal government’s new health research institutes.

Hill is extending a family tradition in helping shape Dallas. Her grandfather and assorted relatives were instrumental in turning the city into a center for oil and gas and she’s now seeking to usher in what she hopes is its next era.

Her biotech push is coming up against the city’s geographic sprawl and a relative lack of capital compared with hubs like Boston or San Francisco. But it echoes efforts by cities including Chicago and Salt Lake City which are trying to cash in on a windfall of public and private funding for biomedical manufacturing and research in the aftermath of the pandemic.

Winning the research institute caps a successful start for Hill’s 30-month-old campus known as Pegasus Park. It beat out Massachusetts to lure the headquarters for a $1 billion “de-extinction” startup called Colossal Biosciences that is seeking to revive the woolly mammoth along with the Tasmanian tiger and other long-gone species. Just this week the company announced an agreement with the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation to host dodo birds if it’s successful in reviving them.

BioLabs a co-working company focused on the life sciences industry has its only US location outside the coastal states at Pegasus Park. And now it will have the new federal research hub that will focus on project management for biotech studies and trials.

Hill who declined a request for an interview is from one of the most prominent Dallas dynasties though she zealously guards her privacy. Her grandfather an avid gambler who grew up on an Illinois farm turned a $50 loan into what eventually became one of the largest US oil companies with Life Magazine calling him the richest man in the US in 1948.

He had 15 children including Hill’s mother Margaret Hunt Hill who has an iconic bridge named after her over the Trinity River in Dallas. Lamar Hunt founded the American Football League and created the Super Bowl.

Many of the descendants of H.L. Hunt have gone on to be influential figures mostly in Dallas but also Kansas City and Chicago. They’ve built skyscrapers and bought sports teams and used their fortunes to give back. Clark Hunt chief executive of the Kansas City Chiefs leads the Hunt Family Foundation that focuses on providing basic necessities for those in need. Luxury hotel magnate Caroline Rose Hunt who died in 2018 joined with her grandchildren to donate $5 million to United Way of Metropolitan Dallas in 2015.

“There’s a reputation for wealth building but there’s also a reputation for setting that aside in favor of community building and doing something that’s gonna benefit the city long term” said Cal Jillson a professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.

Hill has done just that in the life sciences industry partly motivated by her own battle with breast cancer. Her charitable donations include $50 million to the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center’s Moon Shots Program; $50 million to the UT Southwestern Medical Center that was partly used to create the Lyda Hill Department of Bioinformatics; $20 million to the Hockaday School a private all girls school in Dallas to fund science-focused programs; and $30 million to the Dallas-based Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute.

On the investment side she provided early funding to Peloton Therapeutics which was acquired by Merck & Co. in 2019.

For now most of her attention is going to Pegasus Park which seeks to overcome one of Dallas’s most vexing challenges to becoming a biotech hub. Cities like Boston San Francisco and New York enjoy a concentration of capital entrepreneurs and academia in a small area. Dallas struggles with dispersion — while the city’s population is 1.3 million the sprawling Dallas-Fort Worth metro area boasts some 8 million residents.

“Metros that are the size of DFW historically have challenges finding a way to keep these companies clustered together in the same neighborhood” said Travis McCready the head of the life sciences practice in the Americas at JLL a $7 billion global real estate company.

The 26-acre campus sits near the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center a research institute that employs six Nobel laureates. Several of the professors work on startups that operate out of BioLabs. And the campus is expanding — construction has started on a new wing that will be a laboratory facility.

Steve Case the billionaire co-founder of AOL said during a visit to Pegasus Park in September that such hubs can fuel innovation just by bringing together people from different companies and institutions who wouldn’t normally collaborate.

“The very beginning of what’s happening here is quite encouraging and I think bodes well for this next chapter” said Case who now runs investment firm Revolution which focuses on investments in places outside of traditional venture hubs like San Francisco and Boston.

What Dallas lacks and what Case’s firm is trying to solve is access to capital. Venture capital funding in Dallas was $157 million in the third quarter versus $10.2 billion in San Francisco and $3.5 billion in Boston according to PitchBook data.

BioLabs has been hosting informal meetings at Old Parkland an office park in Dallas that houses asset management firms to tout investment opportunities at Pegasus Park. Gabby Everett a scientist and director of the Dallas Biolabs site said there are ongoing discussions between some founders and investors.

Hill’s representatives say her involvement in Pegasus Park includes a mix of philanthropic efforts and for-profit investments but declined to provide a detailed breakdown.

Another developer is looking to cash in on the biotech industry in North Texas. NexPoint founder James Dondero has proposed a $4 billion project that would convert Ross Perot’s former Electronic Data Systems campus in the Dallas suburb of Plano into a life sciences hub. NexPoint received rezoning approval from the Plano city council in November.

The region is already home to major life science firms including Irving-based McKesson Corp. and Galderma which has its US headquarters in Fort Worth. The DFW airport was one of the first in the country to support cold chain cargo for pharmaceutical shipments.

Texas economist Ray Perryman said North Texas has all the ingredients for a thriving life sciences community including a large and expanding population skilled workforce quality health care systems research and education centers and a vibrant financial sector.

“Dallas-Fort Worth has tremendous potential to be a biotech life sciences hub of global significance” he said. “The industry has been growing very rapidly and it’s viewed favorably by the investment community.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vc2NpdGVjaGRhaWx5LmNvbS9jb3NtaWMtY2FydG9ncmFwaHktbWlzc2lvbi1uYXNhcy1pbWFwLXRvLXNldC1zYWlsLWZvci1pbnRlcnN0ZWxsYXItbWFwcGluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cosmic Cartography Mission: NASA's IMAP To Set Sail for Interstellar Mapping,"IMAP set for launch in late April to May 2025 marks a key phase in space exploration focusing on mapping solar wind interactions and the heliosphere’s boundary. This NASA-led mission with broad international collaboration also features a unique public live feed of its development.

The Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) has successfully completed Key Decision Point D (KDP-D). This milestone allows the mission to move from development and design to the assembly testing and integration phase. IMAP’s planned launch date which was no earlier than February 2025 was also reevaluated during the KDP-D and was moved to a target launch window from late April to late May 2025 to ensure that the project team has adequate resources to address risks and technical complexities during system integration and testing.

Role and Impact of IMAP

IMAP will function as a modern-day cartographer and will help us understand what happens when the solar wind (a constant stream of particles from the Sun) collides with materials from interstellar space. This will help researchers map the boundary of the heliosphere the magnetic bubble created by the solar wind and better understand how this magnetic bubble protects Earth from large amounts of harmful cosmic radiation. IMAP will be positioned about one million miles from Earth and its instruments will collect and study the particles that make it through the heliosphere.

Collaborative Efforts and Public Engagement

Principal investigator and Princeton University professor David McComas leads the IMAP mission which has an international team of more than 20 partner institutions. Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) is managing the development phase is building the spacecraft and will operate the mission. IMAP is the fifth mission in NASA’s Solar Terrestrial Probes (STP) Program portfolio. The Explorers and Heliophysics Projects Division at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt Maryland manages the STP Program for the agency’s Heliophysics Division of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.

The public can watch the spacecraft come together in real-time via a live feed from APL’s clean room which is now available to watch at any time on the IMAP mission website. Viewers can watch the continuous stream to see exactly how IMAP develops from a bare-bones structure to a complex fully operational spacecraft.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vb2lscHJpY2UuY29tL0VuZXJneS9FbmVyZ3ktR2VuZXJhbC9OZWFyLVJlY29yZC1EaXNjb3VudC1Gb3ItRVUtRXF1aXRpZXMtSXNudC1Fbm91Z2gtRm9yLUludmVzdG9ycy5odG1s0gFyaHR0cHM6Ly9vaWxwcmljZS5jb20vRW5lcmd5L0VuZXJneS1HZW5lcmFsL05lYXItUmVjb3JkLURpc2NvdW50LUZvci1FVS1FcXVpdGllcy1Jc250LUVub3VnaC1Gb3ItSW52ZXN0b3JzLmFtcC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Near-Record Discount For EU Equities Isn't Enough For Investors,"Even a near-record discount for European stocks relative to the US isn’t proving enough to entice investors worried about a slowing economy and weakening profits.

After starting the year well ahead of the S&P 500 the Stoxx Europe 600 lost ground from May onward as the buzz around artificial intelligence fired up technology stocks across the Atlantic. Worries about a regional recession have also fueled an exodus from European stock funds and the index is back to underperforming US stocks in dollar terms for the full year.

That’s a frustrating turn of events for equity bulls who were banking on a 35% discount in Europe’s price-to-earnings ratio — almost the lowest on record — to rekindle investor interest. Wall Street strategists say the gap isn’t closing any time soon.

Forecasters from Bank of America to Deutsche Bank expect the S&P 500 to hit a record high in 2024. The outlook for European benchmarks is a lot more timid with earnings expected to rise just 6.7% versus an 11% gain in the US according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence.

“We expect European stocks to underperform the US” says Marija Veitmane senior multi-asset strategist at State Street Global Markets. “We are already in a global manufacturing downturn and it’s really weighing on cyclical exporter markets like Europe.” While she agrees European stocks are relatively cheap “unfortunately value tends to underperform in a recession” she says.

Veitmane is not alone. A multi-asset portfolio team at Societe Generale says European stocks are likely to show no gains at all next year amid an economic slowdown. They see the region’s stocks potentially slumping nearly 10% early in the year — a starkly bearish stance compared with the US where they expect the S&P 500 to flirt with its all-time peak.

The gloom has also been reflected in the investor exodus from the region this year. European stock funds had outflows for 37 straight weeks according to a Bank of America note citing EPFR Global. Even Goldman Sachs’s Sharon Bell who expects the Stoxx 600 to rise next year says the main buyers will come from within Europe via corporate buybacks.

Not that the discount doesn’t matter. Part of Bell’s optimism stems from Europe’s “reasonable valuations.” And while JPMorgan’s Mislav Matejka is staying underweight on the euro zone versus the US for now his team say they could potentially change that call through the first half of 2024 “given the increasingly attractive valuations.” Oliver Collin co-head of European equities at Invesco says that “European equities are one of the few equity markets to still be attractively priced relative to bonds.”

But that’s not enough for bears like BofA’s Sebastian Raedler who expects the Stoxx 600 to slide 15% halfway through the year. “We see scope for a meaningful deterioration in growth momentum ahead on the back of a weakening credit cycle” he says.

The report also highlighted two trends driving the increase in attack levels: Generative AI (GenAI) and Cybercrime-as-a-Service (CaaS).

GenerativeAI is a technology that can generate realistic and original content such as text images or audio. The report observed that bad actors were using GenAI for content generation to write flawless phishing emails for Man-in-the-Middle attacks or convincing responses on dating apps for romance scams. The report also found that attackers were using bots to scrape data from websites and then using that data to train their GenAI models.

CaaS is a phenomenon that allows anyone to buy or rent bots or other cybercrime tools from online vendors. These vendors offer their services openly and provide training and support to their customers. This lowers the barrier to entry for adversaries who want to commit cybercrime even if they have no technical skills. They can use fully automated bots at scale that cause widespread damage to businesses and consumers. They do not need to know how to code to launch a sophisticated volumetric bot attack. They can buy the bots off the web and use them as they please."

So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.

To quote Buffett 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.

During the last half decade Cencora became profitable. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain just as we have seen here.

The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).

We know that Cencora has improved its bottom line over the last three years but what does the future have in store? If you are thinking of buying or selling Cencora stock you should check out this FREE detailed report on its balance sheet.

What About Dividends?

When looking at investment returns it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens Cencora's TSR for the last 5 years was 161% which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!

A Different Perspective

It's good to see that Cencora has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 19% in the last twelve months. Of course that includes the dividend. However the TSR over five years coming in at 21% per year is even more impressive. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight we need to consider other information too. Take risks for example - Cencora has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.

The Rebels went on the road and knocked off top-seeded Vermilion Catholic 34-7 to get back to the title game for the first time in seven years. Riverside seeded fifth will face No. 2 seed Southern Lab at 3:30 p.m. Thursday in the Division IV select championship game.

The Wildcats also prevailed on the road knocking out Sterlington 28-17 to reach the championship for the first time since winning the school’s fifth state title in 2019. St. James will face Union Parish in the Division III non-select final at 3:30 p.m. Friday.

Which I’m sure Hasbro lover of all things Trooper action figure is very happy for.

Especially so as Ahsoka in particular—which took us to multiple conflicts along its titular character’s life on the front lines of the Clone Wars in episode five “Shadow Warrior” giving us Captain Rex and a whole host of multiple eras and liveries of Clone Trooper in live-action—has now given Hasbro the chance to re-release its recently updated Trooper figures in shiny new packaging as part of “Gift the Galaxy” its holiday promotional reveal of new Star Wars toys. Who says you need figures of new characters or new figures of old characters when you can just add more Troopers to your shelf?

Clone mania is striking across both the 6″ Black Series line as well as the 3.75″ Vintage Collection with two new multipack re-releases set to drop next year. In the Black Series fans will be able to snag a Trooper two-pack which includes a Phase 1 Clone Lieutenant clad in blue livery and a Phase 2 332nd Battalion trooper with the Ahsoka-themed helmet livery from Clone Wars’ siege of Mandalore arc. Not to be left out the Vintage Collection will offer a four-pack of phase 2 Troopers—2 plain soldiers one lieutenant. and another 332nd Battalion Trooper to boot.

Tra Gen Studio Series Commander 86 Optimus Prime

Product Code: F8514

EAN: 5010996211835 There were rumours of this circulating the web but now we have proof that the commander class toy of 2024's Studio Series line will be Optimus Prime. The idea of a commander class prime is not far fetched when we see how minimal and barren the trailer that came with leader earthrise Optimus Prime was (who was a retool of Seige Prime with vestigial parts). So this means we will get a new voyager sized Optimus Prime mold with a new trailer that should have more functionality and detail than before. We thank Nemesis Primal for letting us know of this update from JT Prime 17.

How is it ""boring"" for the next SS86 Commander?



ER Leader Optimus was a great figure but the leader price point did his trailer dirty. Furthermore the ER mold had that butt kibble going on that ruined the overall silhouette. If we can have a mini MP that is on par with what 3P is offering at the commander price I'll be all over it.



Also who else could be a Commander in SS86? Ultra Magnus was the previous one and Rodimus Prime was made in Kingdom. And unless he's Core scale a Devastator at the Commander price point would be impossible.

It's boring because it's yet another G1 character we've had multiple attempts at in the past 5 or so years getting a redo in SS86 as opposed to anything more unique and it's the second year in a row it's happened in Commander Class (and the only thing they've done with Commander Class for SS since it's inception no less). Sabrblade's absolutely right about the reasoning behind it and I understand it but there's nothing they can do that will make me excited about it.



Also a number of the things I've heard the community suggest as things they could do with a Commander G1 Optimus to make it better than the ER Leader (a better trailer and no visible wheels in bot mode for example) are things that I'm either indifferent towards (the trailer) or are actively downgrades in my eyes (hidden wheels) which just makes me further unexcited since based on Magnus those are exactly the kinds of ""upgrades"" they're going to prioritize.



Emerje wrote: I still think Commander Class OP should have been a special commemorative release that doesn't take up a SS or main line release and maybe not even hit the exact price point.

Well we've seen this a mile away so no real surprise. Even if Hasbro pulled another fast one and gave us the ER voyager with a new and improved trailer it would sell though not as well. That ER voyager Prime will be hard to beat.



Personally I was hoping they would take SS86 Magnus and rework him into a Powermaster Prime. Or even if they took the Prime that came with the Tenseng base and gave him a trailer to combine with and sold him as a commander I would be happy with.



But we're getting yet another Prime with a trailer and (possibly) an interactive Roller. I hope the SS86 Commander for 2025 will be a brand new Astrotrain. Leader size was too small for him and his engineering and design suffered. Posted by Rodimus Prime on December 2nd 2023 @ 1:42am CST

Better be color changing so it can go from alive to dead. The new vehicle mode size will be a plus to me but not really wanting or needing another trailer even if they make it as snazzy as the last mp primes. Posted by blackeyedprime on December 2nd 2023 @ 3:55am CST

Not surprising at all. I'm actually sort of glad for this since Earthrise Prime seemed weirdly iffy. But I hope this is it for G1 Prime for the foreseeable future. I mean if he turns out as good as Rodimus or Ultra Magnus then it's not as if there'll be any way to top this in any meaningful way anyway. Posted by Rtron on December 2nd 2023 @ 7:15am CST

Another G1 Prime huh? I'm on the fence even though I'm really dumb with my money. On the one hand I already have both Siege AND ER Prime so I have my G1 Prime. And yet I'm curious.



I can't even be annoyed because it's Prime. But I can't be too excited either. Sure ER left room for improvement (especially if you didn't nab that upgrade kit) but it's also pretty good all on it's own and even got a reissue. AND Siege was very G1 all on it's own.

Called that a while back.

But now having Armada Prime and Ultra Magnus not sure how a hollow box is going to use up commander class budget. Its going to have to have a ton of accessories to get there.



But Alas its a G1 Prime so I’ll need to muster up $90 bucks for him. Hopefully he comes out a few months removed from MP Rhinox Would be a terrible hit to the wallet if they come out at about the same time.



Also since this is SS86 how close to MP Prime is he expected to look? Posted by Overcracker on December 2nd 2023 @ 8:33am CST

No what's truly boring is getting umpteen copies of that stupid old camaro ""Bumblebee"" in SS not to mention the number of Bayverse Optimus figures we've gotten. G1 Optimus is a movie character that hasn't gotten a figure in the SS line yet but definitely deserves one so this move makes sense.

I'm down for this. Not surprised in the least since it's Optimus - aka an inevitability for every last size price line subline subline sub-imprint package refresh licensed product line and so on. Also seemed like a given once Motormaster and Ultra Magnus had a somewhat consistent truck and trailer alt mode size. Now OP can be that size in vehicle mode too.

ER Optimus and Kd Ultra Magnus were far FAR from being ""definitive"".



Have solace in the fact that once SS86 is finally done we may finally see the very first Bay Commander. But what would that be? Appart the TLK demonic combiner or maybe Dragonstorm I have no idea.

KD OP isn't perfect but I don't think he's THAT far from being definitive.



Hopefully this'll be the final word on G1 Prime as a mainline release. He needs to take a bow. Seeing the old flatnose cab was refreshing at first but WOW has it been overplayed. Posted by Gauntlet101010 on December 2nd 2023 @ 10:23am CST

I don't think DOTM Optimus would be Commander material. Not only did the trailer was pretty complete they even squeezed in the jetwings too for the previous Leader.



As for DOTM Shockwave's Driller I could see that happening but only at the Core Class scale. The set would include a Core Class DOTM Shockwave too. The Driller would be non-transformable (a sin) but would have plenty of articulation points and moving parts. And to compensate that the Driller itself wouldn't transform why not include in a Core Class DOTM Optimus with his trailer that convert into the weapons ring? That would be freaking awesome and we could recreate the movie scene. I don't think DOTM Optimus would be Commander material.

ROTB Stratosphere could be a candidate but Rise of the Beasts didn't do very well as a movie not sure about the toylines. And Concept Stratosphere feels too risky.

I had been wondering about this release; a while back I started thinking this may have been false rumor.



It is a completely understandable move anniversary year or not.

This figure is going to sell and sell well simply based on the character.

Sure the alt mode was probably a factor but it was no surprise (at least to me) when this guy was made into that semi-recent Lego set-- in the realm of toys (and relatively speaking in the realm of 80's culture and nostalgia) he's an icon.

I believe this is one even casual fans and non-collectors will buy. $90+ is much easier to throw-down when you're not also dropping hundreds on other figures throughout the year.



Since I'll never have MP-44 (I can't justify $400+ for a toy) I'm really excited about the confirmation of this figure. Prime isn't even in my top 10 favorite TF characters but assuming this version is on point there's no way I'll pass on this. It's an instant preorder.

For me it's a boring choice because I'm not one looking to rebuy the same characters over and over every couple of years. Now an update to an older figure from 5-10 years ago to modern standards sure I can see that appeal. And it's to the point where it just gets old to constantly see minor improvements each over a figure from 2-3 years ago or be put into a higher class to justify charging even more. Meanwhile no proper Hound Powerglide Soundwave just to name a few. And that's not counting a much needed reissue of VW Bumblebee Sunstreaker Prowl Thrust etc.



Heck I'd rather get a Commander Astrotrain then maybe they could get his looks/aesthetics and functionality done right for a triple changer!



Look I get that prime it the all time go to for getting people to buy him time after time when they've already bought him last year the year before and the year before that. But I would rather those resources went into something new if not that at least not the same characters over and over. Posted by Till-all-R1 on December 2nd 2023 @ 12:01pm CST

I'm looking forward to seeing SS86 Optimus Prime after seeing what they did with Kingdom Rodimus. Optimus will definitely be bigger than the Earthrise release so I think it'll fit in well. I agree with the other voices that this should be the last G1 Prime for a long time something I hope Hasbro would come out and say.

G1 Optimus Prime is one of the most recognizable toy characters in history. They are never going to be done making his toys. If they said they were done all that would get them is the inevitable fury when they make another one.

I don’t think this release will involve any damaged parts even removable unless Hastak goes with a relatively empty triailer. Or at least one with limited parts & engineering on the interior. Although putting a small peg or two on his lower left torso as an option for previously owned blast effects wouldn’t shock me either.

What will be interesting is how much is in the trailer since that interior was never part of the movie.

I’m betting we can safely assume that will be determined/prioritized after the bot is handled/designed.



It won’t bother me either way but my gut tells me this bot is going to be substantially larger than the previous voyager versions.

I know it may cause a handful of characters such as Blaster Inferno Grapple Trailbreaker & Hoist to appear a bit small; but that would put him more in scale with a lot more figures from the minibots to characters like Sideswipe & Ironhide to the Dinobots & Ultra Magnus.

I always thought the voyager was a bit on the small side.



One reason I really hope this happens is because it may be another nudge for Hastak to make a new vastly improved G1 (bot mode) Megatron. Posted by Sowndwave76 on December 3rd 2023 @ 8:25am CST

Well if they cheat a bit with the story I'm sure a perfect looking G1 bot Megatron that transform into a tank would be possible in leader class.

Like I said I won't be shocked or surprised if there is something included that helps create the battle damage. But there's no way I see that as being the central design aspect/gimmick of this figure. Hastak may choose to take the bot of this CC version and re-release it in a retooled repainted ""dead"" exclusive version. It would actually be a decent way to get another use out of what is normally a one-and-done figure class.

But obviously he wasn't just seen dead in the movie. And with this I wouldn't be surprised if the anniversary (even though it's not a major anniversary year for the movie) influences this release at least some.

We'll see hopefully sooner than later but just like Ironhide Brawn and Ratchet have non-damaged SS86 versions I see this release following suit.

And similar to SS86 Ultra Magnus I'm betting this new CC version is essentially meant to be the definitive G1 version of OP. Not only will this represent his movie appearance but also his appearance in every cartoon episode. The packaging is going to be SS86 but there's also a bigger picture here.



AllNewSuperRobot wrote: I think RED is going to be the only viable option for SS'86 Megs really.

For now yes. But if there's a major character that is overdue for an updated screen-accurate figure Megatron has to be towards the top of that list.

I and others have said it for a while now-- it's time to make a version that looks completely G1 in bot mode and allow the alt mode to ""suffer"". At this point I don't care that it's not a pistol... Not to mention if it were it's not like that could be held by any other figure. Even one as large as CW Devastator would look awkward holding a handgun that's almost the same size as one of the seeker jets.

My main issue with CC for Rodimus was tooling resources put into the trailer thereby increasing the price point which landed him in CC. For those of us not really into the ""cargo"" section that only display their Bots on a shelf it artificially inflates the price. When I personally would have been fine with Leader Class if it left out the Trailer although really he feels more like a Voyager to me.



I had the same issue with Leader Kingdom Prime ""technically"" a Voyager put into a Leader price point with a craptastic trailer to make it seem worth the increase. I would have certainly opted for a Voyager release if it meant no trailer.



At least with both UM releases the trailer actually becomes part of the Bot so you're not left with an unused item collecting dust somewhere. I just don't have that kind of space to store ""extras"" or to set up an alt display with them in Alt mode or to utilize the ""battle platform"" function that bot OP and Rodimus trailers have.



All that said it will depend greatly on how his basic both mode turns out and if they don't cheap out with the trailer again on whether I'd consider buying him. Because while I may not ""use"" in that sense I'm not about to ""pay"" for something that isn't delivered. Posted by Till-all-R1 on December 3rd 2023 @ 12:09pm CST

So being very objective what needs to happen for a G1 Prime to warrant Commander Class price?



If we start with Earthrise as our basis:



1. Needs to be larger. Earthrise was fine for its purpose but for a commander class that works with the SS-86 figures better and to accommodate the price it really needs to be a bit beefier. Might not be really any taller but it does need to feel like there is more going on inside. More heft if you will.



2. Starting from the top maybe a different head option. not sure what that could be. don't think they'd include a Starscream head for this but maybe a more toy accurate head and a cartoon head? Yellow eyes and blue eyes?



3. Longer Smokestacks. Earthrise's were pitifully small.



4. Arm articulation is fine and don't see much room for improvement there but it probably wold need to get a separate index finger for ""heroic pointing""



5. Maybe an ab-crunch.



6. They'd need to resolve the bumper and front wheels issue. They have to somehow make them tuck into his back and not be hanging down his back which limits the waist swivel when properly stowed.



7. Slightly less lanky legs. and better gas tanks. The ones on earth rise where less than stellar and had a tendency to not hold open in truck mode or move out in robot mode and mine pop out quite easily.



8. Knees and ankles are fine. So other than maybe some red lights for the toes not much needs to be improved there.



Moving onto the Trailer:

1. It definitely needs to be bigger.

2. Needs to have a blue repair bot with missiles (even if they don't launch not expecting spring loaded launchers in any way)

3. Locations to store all accessories.

4. Probably more G1 accurate fold out stands for base mode.



Accessories

They need to include them this time and not make you buy an entirely different figure for them.

1. Ion Blaster (large non-folding accurate)

2. Axe. Large translucent Axe.

3. Roller.

4. Matrix (obviously)

5. Sideswipe jetpack

6. Gas nozzle hose and base connector. (I'm having doubts they'd include this though)

7. No doubt they'd include blast effects like Magnus.





I'd expect this would add up to around Magnus's $75 bucks don't see how that can go up to $89.99 though.



What else to add to make that pricer point? Energon cubes? Key to vector sigma? Megatron in gun mode? Spike and Spark Plug?



Seems like either the robot / cab needs to beef up the engineering and parts count or it's getting a ton of superfluous accessories to make up the price. Posted by Overcracker on December 4th 2023 @ 11:53am CST

The gas tanks on ER OP's legs are a constant source of frustration. They don't lock into place and it seems that they're in the exact spot where it's most natural to put your fingers when handling the figure. So you always wind up pushing the tanks down and have to keep pulling them back out. And ER OP's gun was stubby and underwhelming.



It'll be an interesting challenge. If they make him any 'bigger' then he won't be in scale with the other figures like he is now. And we all know what a stickler Hasbro is on keeping figures in scale... Maybe they'll include TWO voyager sized OP figures in the Commander box - a live one and a 'dead' one! Regardless I'll be interested in seeing what they do with this one. ER Optimus is great but the trailer is kind of only 50% 'there'. I've stashed the trailer away in storage simply because I never use it and it takes up shelf space that I could use for displaying other figures.

They need to include them this time and not make you buy an entirely different figure for them.

1. Ion Blaster (large non-folding accurate)

2. Axe. Large translucent Axe.

3. Roller.

4. Matrix (obviously)

5. Sideswipe jetpack

6. Gas nozzle hose and base connector. (I'm having doubts they'd include this though)

7. No doubt they'd include blast effects like Magnus. As part of the studio series line we should expect the figure to be screen accurate and IIRC he didn't use the axe in the movie. He also didn't have the jetpack or Roller and its (his?) accessories.



So to get to the Commander price point that trailer has to be on point probably also used as Optimus's ""death bed.""



However if they focus on the 40th anniversary aspect as opposed to the studio series one then all the stuff you listed should be included.

Let's face it Hasbro would actually release this twice. First as SS86 retail release a well engineered Optimus with done up trailer. He comes with gun and blast effects as well as autobot city backdrop (so fans can remake his epic duel with a non-existent SS86 megs)



Then SDCC rolls round (or pulsecon...or any event really) and they release a 40th anniversary special Commander Class Optimus Prime with all the bells and whistles (roller and all)....They sell it as a higher price.

Across the United States unions and labor movements took to the streets to demand better working conditions more equal pay protections against rapidly increasing tech changes and more.

There are a variety of reasons why 2023 was the year of the walkout. What started as the ""summer of strikes"" has expanded toward the end of 2023 and will likely continue into 2024. These are some of the most notable strikes of the year and what they accomplished for their workers:

Hollywood (SAG-AFTRA and the WGA)

The walkouts that undoubtedly generated the most coverage in 2023 were the dual strikes connected to Hollywood. Both SAG-AFTRA which represents working actors and the Writers Guild of America (WGA) which represents film and television screenwriters walked off the job to demand fairer working conditions and protections against the in-roads of artificial intelligence.

The WGA began striking this May and was looking to even the playing field between writers and the Hollywood studios. This included demands for ""better wages and a better deal on residual payments for streaming shows"" Variety reported in addition to heavy regulation on ""the use of artificial intelligence in the writing process."" The writers were joined two months later by SAG-AFTRA whose key issues included economic fairness residuals regulating the use of artificial intelligence and alleviating the burdens of the industry-wide shift to self-taping.""

The strikes led to a months-long stalemate between the unions and the AMPTP — which represents the major Hollywood studios — that brought the entertainment industry to a near-standstill. The WGA reached an agreement with the AMPTP in September to end its strike followed by SAG-AFTRA coming to terms in November. Both deals included protections against AI usage in studio projects and also wage hikes for writers. Overall the strikes led to ""an estimated $7 billion in economic damage"" the Los Angeles Times reported.

United Auto Workers

While Hollywood's dual strikes may have been the most publicized the walkout from the United Auto Workers (UAW) was likely the most consequential. Workers across the UAW spectrum began picketing in September against the ""Big Three"" American automakers: General Motors Ford and Stellantis. This marked the first-ever trilateral strike targeting all three companies.

UAW which represents the auto industry's frontline factory workers was seeking a number of improvements to its employees' standards of living. The most notable was a demand for ""wage increases of around 40% to cost-of-living protections"" NPR reported which the union said represented ""a long-overdue redressal for all the concessions the union made to prop up the automakers just before and after the 2008 recession."" There was also anger at the growing wealth disparity between employees and the Big Three's CEOs — the head of Stellantis Carlos Tavares reportedly makes 298 times what his average employee does.

Thousands of plants came to a halt as factory workers throughout the Midwest walked out leaving the auto industry in a perilous state. This was rectified by the end of October when the UAW reached new deals with all three automakers. The deals were described by The New York Times as the industry's ""largest wage and benefit increases in decades"" and could go a long way toward the reinvigoration of labor stoppages in the future.

Healthcare workers

Healthcare workers including nurses pharmaceutical employees and hospital staff all walked off the job this year in one of the biggest industry pickets ever. There were at least 27 healthcare industry strikes in 2023 according to Becker's Hospital Review. Most of the striking employees were seeking increases in pay and additional staffing during peak work hours.

The most notable of these disputes was a walkout at Kaiser Permanente that became the largest healthcare labor crisis in U.S. history. Thousands of workers at the California-based health conglomerate picketed this October. A deal was reached with the company on Oct. 14 with a new contract that ""aims to address staffing shortages with raises that will amount to 21% in wage increases over the next four years to help retain current workers"" NPR reported.

Other healthcare industry walkouts in 2023 included a November strike of ""more than 2400 nurses at three HCA Healthcare hospitals in Southern California"" according to Becker's as well as a walkout over staffing shortages at CVS pharmacies in Kansas City Missouri.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vZGVybmhlYWx0aGNhcmUuY29tL2F3YXJkcy8yMDIzLW1vc3QtaW5mbHVlbnRpYWwtaGVhbHRoY2FyZS1oZW1hbnQtdGFuZWphLWdlbmVyYWwtY2F0YWx5c3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2023 Most Influential in Healthcare Hemant Taneja,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.modernhealthcare.com/awards/2023-most-influential-healthcare-hemant-taneja-general-catalyst on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vZGVybmhlYWx0aGNhcmUuY29tL2F3YXJkcy8yMDIzLW1vc3QtaW5mbHVlbnRpYWwtaGVhbHRoY2FyZS1oZW1hbnQtdGFuZWphLWdlbmVyYWwtY2F0YWx5c3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

While there is much more work to be done year-over-year growth in CEI participation is evidence of a business community that recognizes the responsibility and value in upholding equity and inclusion"" said RaShawn ""Shawnie"" Hawkins Human Rights Campaign Sr. Director of Workplace Equality. ""Our goal at the Human Rights Campaign Foundation is to work in a spirit of partnership with companies providing educational resources and leading benchmarking and collaborating on ways for businesses to support the LGBTQ+ community at a time when we face unprecedented legislative attacks heightened anti-LGBTQ+ rhetoric and physical violence. The CEI is an ever-evolving tool – a blueprint that companies can use to show up more effectively in supporting their LGBTQ+ employees and their families.""

QUOTES

NOTES

The Checkers couldn’t find a way to bounce back in their rematch with the defending champs falling 5-2 to Hershey.Unlike last night’s tilt the Checkers took control out of the gates Saturday night - holding the Bears to just five shots in the first period and snaring the lead thanks to a seeing-eye snipe from Uvis Balinskis in his Charlotte debut.Unfortunately for Charlotte the middle frame proved to be all Hershey. The Bears wasted no time drawing the game back even then tacked on two strikes in quick succession later in the period to hold a two-goal advantage heading into the second intermission.That lopsided period would ultimately be the difference. The Bears pushed their lead even further early on in the third but Lucas Carlsson had a rebuttal shortly after - hammering home a point blast to pull within two and put a spark back in the home team. Hershey netminder Clay Stevenson once again frustrated the Checkers though and an empty-net deposit from Ethen Frank for the hat trick sealed Charlotte’s fate.Yesterday I didn’t like the start and being down especially in the first period. I thought there was some good things after that and it continued on to tonight. A good start a 1-0 start so we corrected that mistake. I’d like to get it to 2-0 when we had some chances and didn’t get it to 2-0. They’re Calder Cup champs for a reason. They have experience over there and they’re opportunistic. I thought they were opportunistic. Move on.I thought they were opportunistic. We made a couple of little mistakes. Two of the goals are on our sticks so we want to make sure we correct that. A lot to like from the game. A good building block. We corrected a mistake from the other night. Again it’s early in the season. We want to become a 60-minute hockey team but there’s a process to getting there and getting guys to be able to feel confident scoring goals. I like the competitiveness to be able to score now once they get the confidence you’ll start to see a little more results with regard to scoring goals.I think there’s a lot of really good things and recipes. We have to score some big-time goals at opportunistic times. Again a 1-0 hockey game you want to make it 2-0. We’re not giving up many chances to be quite honest but we have to be able to get the back-breaking goals to make it 2-0. You look at the Cleveland game 1-1 they come down on a 2-on-1 to score and make it 2-1. We have to get that big-time goal at the right time from some of our players.The Checkers went 1-5-0 over their six-game home stand. Prior to that they were 4-1-0 at home with four straight wins … The Checkers have scored two goals or fewer in seven of their last nine games. During that time they have out-shot the opposition eight times and tied once … Carlsson’s goal was his first since scoring a hat trick on Nov. 10 … Balinskis played his first AHL game … Checkers scratches included forwards Riley Bezeau and Brendan Perlini; defensemen Dennis Cesana Matt Kiersted Evan Nause and Will Reilly; and goaltender Mack Guzda.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3J1c3NpYW5tYWNoaW5lbmV2ZXJicmVha3MuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMDMvc291dGgtY2Fyb2xpbmEtc3RpbmdyYXlzLWhvbGQtdGVkZHktYmVhci10b3NzLXdoaWxlLXdlYXJpbmctaGVyc2hleS1iZWFycy1pbnNwaXJlZC1qZXJzZXlzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,South Carolina Stingrays hold Teddy Bear Toss while wearing Hershey Bears inspired jerseys,"The South Carolina Stingrays the Washington Capitals’ ECHL affiliate held their annual Teddy Bear Toss game on Sunday.

Just 8:32 into the first period forward Austin Magera potted a rebound from a Tyson Empey shot past the Trois-Rivieres Lions’ goaltender and brought down clouds of teddy bears and other stuffed animals onto the ice.

It was “sweet cuddly mayhem” to quote the voice of the Hershey Bears Zack Fisch.

Let the bears fly! pic.twitter.com/rO3o9xcLHb — SC Stingrays (@SCStingrays) December 3 2023

Magera’s strike was the first goal of the game giving the Stingrays a 1-0 lead. Fans then began heaving thousands of stuffed animals onto the ice at North Charleston Coliseum.

Some of the Stingrays players including Capitals goaltending prospect Garin Bjorklund helped clear the ice of the stuffed animals and posed for some photos among the cuddly mess.

The Stingrays say that all of the stuffed animals from this year’s Teddy Bear Toss will be “collected and donated to various non-profits in the South Carolina Lowcountry.”

Magera would get on the board again in the second period to make the game 2-0. He is now tied for second on the team in goal scoring with Tyson Empey at nine goals apiece. The Stingrays would go on to beat the Trois-Rivières Lions 3-2.

Not only did the Stingrays go above and beyond for local charities they also saluted the Hershey Bears their AHL affiliate and the former world record holder for most teddy bears collected during a Teddy Bear Toss game.

The Stingrays wore special chocolate and white jerseys in a nod to Hershey’s branding.

Last season the Stingrays collected a total of 12380 stuffies for their event — an impressive feat.

The Bears will hold their own Teddy Bear Toss on January 7 against the Lehigh Valley Phantoms.

The Washington Capitals announced that they have recalled goaltender Hunter Shepard ahead of Saturday night’s game against the Knights in Las Vegas. Shepard will replace Charlie Lindgren as the backup for the game against the Knights. Lindgren took a maintenance day on Saturday and will not suit up due to an undisclosed injury.

MORE FROM THE CAPITALS

ARLINGTON Va. – The Washington Capitals have recalled goaltender Hunter Shepard from the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League (AHL) president and general manager Brian MacLellan announced today.

Shepard 28 has a record of 2-0-0 with a 2.50 goals-against average and a .915 save percentage in two games with the Capitals this season. Shepard made his NHL debut and earned his first career win on Oct. 25 at New Jersey. On Nov. 11 against the New York Islanders Shepard stopped 36 of 37 shots and was named the game’s First Star in a 4-1 Washington win. In 10 games with Hershey this season Shepard has posted a record of 9-1-0 with a 2.66 goals-against average and a .898 save percentage. Shepard’s nine wins rank tied for second in the AHL.

Shepard appeared in 33 games with Hershey last season posting a record of 20-8-5 with a 2.18 goals-against average a .916 save percentage and one shutout. The 6’0″ 219-pound goaltender ranked second among AHL goaltenders in goals-against average and tied for sixth in save percentage. Shepard who was awarded the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy as the MVP of the Calder Cup Playoffs started all 20 playoff games for the Bears posting a 14-6 record with a 2.27 goals-against average a .914 save percentage and three shutouts en route to the franchise’s league-record 12th championship. In 55 career AHL games with Hershey Shepard has a record of 37-12-5 with a 2.19 goals-against average a .917 save percentage and three shutouts.

A native of Cohasset Minnesota Shepard won back-to-back NCAA Championships with Minnesota-Duluth in 2018 and 2019. In addition he was twice named the National Collegiate Hockey Conference (NCHC) Goaltender of the Year (2019 and 2020) and earned First-Team All-American honors in 2019 and Second-Team All-American honors in 2020. With Minnesota-Duluth Shepard started an NCAA-record 115 straight games from Oct. 21 2017 to March 7 2020. Shepard finished his NCAA career as a three-time Mike Richter Award Finalist – given to the NCAA’s top goaltender – and a three-time All-NCHC selection.

The pace of discovery in the Stabroek Block has been astounding. There have been 32 major discoveries to date. There are currently 3 projects in production: Liza Phase 1 Liza Phase 2 and Payara. The current daily output is 620000 barrels of oil. There are 2 additional projects approved for production: Yellowtail and Uaru. Plus a third in the approval process named Whiptail. With these 6 projects there is an aim to produce 1.2 million barrels of oil a day by 2027. The six projects that are either producing or will be producing soon have an estimated capital cost of US$55 billion. The government has commissioned 2 audits thus far: the 1999 to 2017 audit which was estimated to cover US$1.7 billion in claimed expenses and the 2018 to 2020 audit that covered US$7.3 billion in claimed expenses. However given that there is a 2-year time-window to audit [Article 23 and Section 1.5 (a) in Annex C of the PSA 2016] it is not clear what is the schedule to audit the remaining at least US$46 billion in expenses (US$55B – US$1.7B – US$7.3B).

To put US$55 billion in perspective before oil production started at the end of 2019 Guyana’s annual national budget was US$2 billion/year. Thus US$55 billion in expenses is more than what Guyana would have spent in the last 27 years combined. Given the astronomical sums involved and the controversies surrounding the 1999 to 2017 audit see here https://www.oggn.org/2023/09/20/gra-is-not-the-competent-authority-to-lead-all-or-any-petroleum-audits/ and the 2018 to 2020 audit see here https://www.oggn.org/2023/11/25/these-findings-justify-a-full-scale-forensic-audit-of-the-2018-2020-accounts-of-exxonmobil-guyana/ one would hope the government could be more transparent with these audits for the public’s benefit. However both the 1999 to 2017 audit which was completed in 2021 and the most recent audit have not been made public by the government. This would naturally raise the question – ‘is the government protecting the oil companies for overbilling Guyana’?

Now let’s look at how the US$55 billion in capital cost is broken down across the 6 projects that are either producing or will soon be in production. The table (below) shows some of the details of these projects. There is a break-even cost per project as stated by one of the Stabroek Block partners i.e. HESS Corporation [in September 2023 before it announced the sale of its interests to Chevron]. One would assume the break-even cost per project would be closely correlated with the capital cost given that it seems from various reports the operational costs may be US$10/barrel. However Uaru which has the same break-even cost as Liza Phase 1 is 37% more expensive in capital cost. Payara is more than double the capital cost per barrel for Liza Phase 1 although the breakeven cost differences between the projects are not that much.

Given the economies of scale and the lessons learnt along the way one would expect that for newer projects the capital cost per barrel would trend downwards. For example all but one of the six floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels were commissioned from the same company SBM Offshore and four are identical in size capacity and design. Hence do the existing audit reports explain this anomaly or will the future US$46 billion plus to be audited tease out what may be going on here? But the Government of Guyana does not have unlimited time to do audits they have to be undertaken within 2 years of the expenses being booked. In Annex ‘C’ Section 1.5 (C) it says “Without prejudice to the finality of matters as described in sub-sections 1.5 (a) and 1.5 (b) all documents referred to in those sub-sections shall be maintained and made available for inspection by the Minister for two (2) years following their date of issue providing however that where issues are outstanding with respect to an audit the Contractor shall maintain documents for a longer period until the issues are resolved.”

In 2018 Dr. Jan Mangal and others using the media raised concerns about the US$4.4 billion in capital cost for Liza Phase 1. As a result that figure was slashed by US$700 million see here https://www.stabroeknews.com/2018/12/16/news/guyana/projected-cost-for-exxons-liza-phase-1-slashed-by-us700m/. After all the revisions Liza Phase 1 went down from US$4.4 billion in capital cost to US$3.5 billion. Thus Liza Phase 1 was inflated by 25%. No reduction has happened with subsequent oil field development projects. One has to wonder given the anomalies in the above table whether a forensic audit of the US$55 billion in capital cost might not uncover significantly inflated numbers. The government should request that Exxon provide more information to explain the discrepancies between the capital cost and break-even cost across the 6 projects. Finally the Government of Guyana needs to demand more oversight in the process leading to the commissioning of new FPSOs.

By Vishani Ragobeer in Dubai

vishani@newsroom.gy

At the northern edge of the South American continent sit two countries Guyana and Suriname with vast forest covers and nascent oil and gas sectors. As world leaders meet in Dubai to decide how the climate crisis could be solved the Presidents of these two states believe that their vast forests must be protected at all costs.

Their argument is similar if not identical.

For years Guyana and Suriname have kept their forests intact. They could have cut their trees down to make way for money-making ventures like agriculture or mining but they didn’t.

And they want to be paid for doing that. Why? Because if they are losing money by not clearing land for economic ventures they need to find other ways to make money to build their countries.

They believe their ask for payments isn’t unwarranted since the trees help to trap vast amounts of carbon dioxide a harmful greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming and the climate crisis. If the trees were cut down the gas would be released into the atmosphere and contribute to worsening disasters like floods or wildfires. Thus their forests benefit the entire world.

“Conservation of our standing forests and biodiversity should be higher valued than reforestation” Suriname’s President Chandrikapersad Santokhi said during his three-minute speech at the high-level summit of this year’s United Nations (UN) climate talks COP28.

The day before his Guyanese counterpart Dr. Irfaan Ali made this point.

“We must preserve forests” he said.

And President Ali pointed out how Guyana has been working largely on its own to get compensation for its forest protection efforts since 2009. It has been doing so through its Low Carbon Development Strategy (LCDS).

The countries’ forest credentials are intact. Suriname has the world’s highest national forest cover: 93% of its landmass. Guyana has the second highest at 85%.

Both Presidents argued that compensation won’t just help keep those forests standing it would also help to protect the rich biodiversity (the plants and animals) there and help support the people who depend on the trees like Indigenous communities.

Two years ago both leaders were in Glasgow for COP26. And there they both shared the similar message: countries with vast forests must be paid to keep those intact.

Since then both countries have advanced their case. They are both getting into the carbon market. Guyana already has a deal with one of the oil companies in its lucrative Stabroek Block offshore the Hess Corporation.

The deal is worth at least US$750 million with leeway for Guyana to earn more if prices in the carbon market go up.

Suriname on the other hand is exploring how it can sell carbon credits under the Paris Agreement in keeping with UN guidelines.

A carbon credit is a kind of tradeable permit or certificate that represents the removal of a certain amount of carbon dioxide from the environment. Since carbon dioxide is the principal greenhouse gas that harms the environment it is tracked and traded like any other commodity and hence the name carbon market.

Carbon markets have been the subject of much scrutiny recently and as newcomers Guyana and Suriname have to figure out how they make this work for them.

THE ‘OIL’ IN THE ROOM

But the other elephant in the room for both these countries is their burgeoning oil and gas industries. That sector is a huge emitter of carbon dioxide and talks on reducing the world’s dependance on oil and gas are abundant at COP28.

Guyana and Suriname want countries to understand their plight.

President Santokhi said his country is forced to “adapt to extreme dry and wet weather events which cause losses and damages” because of the climate crisis. Without enough compensation the country is left largely to fend for itself.

He explained that Suriname can now however leverage its oil resources to fund its developmental needs.

“… we must respond to the legitimate demands of our population for economic development and diversification” he said promising that Suriname will continue to offset carbon from around the world with its forests.

For Guyana the world’s newest oil hotspot slashing oil and gas use shouldn’t be the sole focus of plans to solve the climate crisis.

For him those plans should include the phase out of fossil fuels like oil but also efforts to keep forests intact. And he reminded a gathering at a Guyana side event at COP28 that the demand for energy remains huge- there are countries still grappling with energy poverty- and the existing supply of renewable energy just does not fill that gap.

Balancing these resources to meet developmental needs is a huge focus of the LCDS the President said.

So they both make it clear as they continue to protect their forests they will develop their resources. They only hope that they will get adequate support to do so.

San Diego is such a popular business and vacation destination that hotel prices often reflect demand instead of quality.

It’s not uncommon for visitors to experience sticker shock here even with national brands normally known for low prices.

However the best budget hotels in San Diego don’t always mean sacrifice. The ones reviewed on this list have cool contemporary interiors great restaurants and convenient locations in or near tourist areas. Are they the cheapest hotels in town? No but they are places you can feel good about staying that aren’t as expensive as some of our other hotels.

This is without a doubt the most difficult list we have to create and maintain because hotels renovate and demand causes prices to spike or plummet. We’ve done our best to find the best consistent value.

Prices for Cheap Hotels in San Diego Vary by Location or Season

As I just mentioned a budget hotel can price like a luxury hotel during certain timeframes. And on the contrary some of our nicer resorts can have low prices during the off-season.

When exploring the cheap hotels San Diego has to offer know that location plays a big role in price. For example prices for all Gaslamp San Diego hotels increase drastically during Comic-Con or large conventions due to proximity to the Convention Center.

Additionally San Diego hotels near the beach have higher prices year-round than their urban counterparts especially during months when schools are on holiday or when the sun is shining.

These seasonal fluctuations are not usually seen in other San Diego neighborhoods such as the inland Mira Mesa neighborhood. In fact the more inland you go and further away from tourist areas the easier it is to find cheap San Diego hotels.

Note from Katie: We independently choose all featured hotels. Booking methods mentioned are popular with our readers or ones we think offer the best value.

It’s kind of hard to believe that a resort like this would fall into the budget category but it does mostly due to its Mission Valley location. It’s in what’s called Hotel Circle where many business and budget hotels in San Diego line the I-8 freeway. So the access to important transportation arteries is good but you won’t find beaches or views to speak of.

Town and Country Resort recently underwent an extensive multi-million dollar renovation that accentuated the Mid-Century vibe and refreshed the amazing pool deck with a fun water slide nearby firepits and a zero-entry family pool.

All of the rooms have modern decor and amenities like Keurig coffee makers and Egyptian cotton sheets— even art by local artists. You can also choose larger suites and to dine at one of the three onsite outlets. They also normally offer a large roster of activities and lawn games.

This is the best full-service resort on this list for consistent value.

The Fin Hotel in Oceanside is one of those gems where you get 300-thread-count sheets just a few walkable blocks away from an awesome beach and great dining. I want to mention it because a hotel like this will allow you to assess the value proposition between a northern location and one closer to say Balboa Park.

Rooms come with Keurigs and big 50″ TVs. There’s even a concierge desk. An onsite restaurant called The Switchboard serves Hawaiian-inspired fare in honor of the women who worked in the building during WWII when it was a war command center.

Pricing can increase as the hotel sells out and on peak dates so book in advance to enjoy lower $100s rates.

13. La Jolla Cove Suites

Neighborhood: The Village of La Jolla

Address: 1155 Coast Blvd La Jolla CA 92037

As I mentioned earlier cheap hotels in San Diego near the beach will typically have higher rates than inland properties. La Jolla Cove Suites prices very well for its oceanfront location in the heart of the Village of La Jolla.

It’s located steps from La Jolla Cove beach where our famous sea lions congregate. The fabulous location also allows guests to walk to the best restaurants and shopping in La Jolla.

However the hotel is undergoing some much-needed changes to deal with the issues guests have left in reviews. There is the new Pines section where rooms are a little pricier. However you can stay in some Terrace rooms for the mid-$150 range or lower. And that’s a steal for the location if you don’t mind some street noise and some cosmetic imperfections in the older rooms and some common areas.

It’s a good option for groups looking for a more wallet-friendly La Jolla hotel because of some larger suites. They also have a great rooftop with panoramic ocean views that occasionally hosts events.

FAQs About Budget Hotels in San Diego

Trust me I know how frustrating it can be to find an affordable hotel here. Here are some questions I receive.

Can Hotel del Coronado Have Budget Hotel Pricing? Not really. During the off-peak season you might find a non-renovated resort view Victorian room at Hotel del Coronado in the $250/night plus $50/night resort fee and taxes — but this is rare. And this building is closing for renovation in early 2024 so there’s no chance of budget pricing at this resort when it’s done. Otherwise the cheapest rooms are around $400/night. Why are there not Many hotels under $100/night on this list? Kings Inn and the two Best Westerns are really the hotels on this list that can price under $100/night. We don’t have others on this list because we can’t recommend them due to quality control reasons and truthfully there just aren’t that many to begin with in the tourist neighborhoods. We actually used to have more options in this price range but these hotels were purchased and renovated to a higher standard. And then the pandemic hit and San Diego became one of the most popular vacation destinations thanks to its outdoor activities and sunshine. Where Can I Find Even Cheaper Hotels in San Diego? The further you go inland the less expensive hotels (and likewise real estate) will be. You can check lesser trafficked areas like Mira Mesa Rancho Bernardo and San Marcos.

On October 21 the crew of the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise rescued a humpback whale entangled in fishing gear. Entanglement with fishing gear claims the lives of over 300000 dolphins and whales every year making it the leading cause of mortality for these majestic animals.

The rescue underscored the precarious situation that marine mammals in the high seas face. Governments must urgently ratify the Global Oceans Treaty to ensure the protection of whales and all other marine species.

Hong Kong – Ban on disposable plastic cutlery

From April next year restaurants in Hong Kong will be banned from giving out throwaway plastic cutlery including plastic straws and stirrers. Hotels and guest houses will not be allowed to supply water in plastic bottles or toiletries in synthetic disposable containers. This piece of good news is a small but significant effort to help stem the plastic tide but further steps have to be taken in order to solve the plastic crisis. Greenpeace together with millions of our supporters demand a Global Plastics Treaty that will reduce plastic production by at least 75% by 2040.

On 29 September Greenpeace Hungary won a legal case against a Hungarian government-issued permit for a state-financed tourism project at Lake Neusiedl national park a UNESCO World Heritage site. Construction has been halted and a new public procurement tender process has been launched for the project that aims to encourage ecotourism.

This victory is the result of three years of online and offline campaigning to save the park in cooperation with local civilians Greenpeace Austria and Hungarian influencers helping to shine a spotlight on this important issue. Greenpeace Hungary will continue their ongoing legal proceedings and monitor the Lake Fertő project until the last construction vehicle leaves the site.

On 12 October the environmental court in Nairobi barred the government from lifting the ban on logging but allowed the felling of 5000 hectares of mature forest.

In July President William Ruto restated Kenya’s ambitious plan to plant 15 billion trees by the year 2032 to restore forests and fight climate change. Greenpeace Africa urges the Kenya government to demonstrate this commitment to forests by prioritizing existing forests over hopes for saplings.

In a landmark victory for environmental protection and governance Greenpeace Romania and ClientEarth have won a four-year legal battle against illegal coal pollution in Romania.

Nearly half of the country’s coal plants were operating permit-free a major breach of the EU’s Industrial Emissions Directive (IED) – with no real consequences from authorities or national courts.

In response Romania has reformed its national pollution law and several illegal coal plants have been shut down.

On 3 November it was announced that the DRC government’s attempt to auction off oil fields in Congo had to be postponed for the third time.

In July last year the DRC launched a giant auction of 30 oil and gas fields threatening local communities and biodiversity in the world’s second largest rainforest and carbon-rich peatlands. The news of another delay is a great development and DRC activists and their supporters and allies from all over the world have every reason to celebrate even as they continue their fight.

After 9 years of procedure a Belgian climate litigation case finally got a big victory. After a first symbolic win in 2021 where the judge held that the Belgium government breached its duty of care by failing to take necessary measures to prevent the harmful effects of climate change but did not rule on binding reduction targets the Court of Appeal has now ruled in favour of such binding targets.

That’s the view of Glenn Cooper chairman of St Helens-based Inovus Medical when he spoke at pro-manchester’s latest HealthTech conference.

Founded in 2012 by Dr Elliot Street and Jordan van Flute Inovus is on a mission to become the world’s partner for surgical training and recently secured major partnerships with AAGL and Hologic Inc.

Cooper said: “There’s a much more open discussion and adoption of our technology in the US than the UK.

“The big tech companies are leading the way. They’re so open about the new technology – as long as you deliver.

“The message we’re trying to get across is we have a track record of delivering and we’re not doing this by remote control from the UK. We’re invested in the US with American solutions.

“It’s 45 per cent of the global market. It is the most important market by size.”

Cooper took part in a panel discussion hosted by BusinessCloud executive editor Chris Maguire.

He was joined by Leontina Postelnicu policy and public affairs lead at Feebris who said: “There’s still a lot to be done around improving awareness and understanding around digital health technology.”

Lauren Bevan director of consulting at Ethical Healthcare Consulting said the health sector’s adoption of technology had slowed since the Covid pandemic.

“The urgency isn’t there to be able to put new things in” she said. “The pace has changed and there’s still sustained pressure in the system. Managers and teams are still struggling to manage backlogs. What we’re also seeing is people are less willing to take risks.”

She predicted the forthcoming general election would have a significant impact on the NHS.

“If there’s a change in government I would say the change would be different” she said. “I think they (Labour) will be focussing on different priorities.

“I think that will be about getting the basics right and getting things to deliver rather than newsworthy headlines about attention-grabbing things like AI.

“Hopefully there will be more attention to what trusts and systems are asking for rather than what feels like their vote-grabbing headlines.”

The final member of the panel was Jon Pickering CEO of electronic document management specialist Mizaic.

He said: “The future for us is about disrupting the whole way in which people have been thinking about paper medical records for lots of years and digitalising it as quickly as possible to make that data of use for clinicians.”

Mizaic is currently helping digitise the medical records of 10 per cent of acute hospitals in the UK but Pickering said they wanted to increase this number.

“You can archive it (paper-based medical records) or you can make it of use to the clinician” he said. “We make it of use to the clinician.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

With the late 2023 rally underway investors can bolster their portfolios by adding a select group of dividend payers into the mix. Dividend-paying stocks give investors a combination of potential price appreciation and income which can enhance total returns. Bearing that in mind here are five attractive dividend stocks according to Wall Street's top experts on TipRanks a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Energy Transfer

First on this week's list is Energy Transfer (ET) a limited partnership that operates a diversified portfolio of energy assets in the U.S. with nearly 125000 miles of pipelines. ET recently completed its acquisition of Crestwood Equity Partners. In October ET declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.3125 per common unit for the third quarter which was paid on Nov. 20. The stock has a dividend yield of 9%. Commenting on the third-quarter results RBC Capital analyst Elvira Scotto said that Energy Transfer delivered a solid performance with adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization exceeding the consensus estimate by 7%. The analyst also noted the increase in the 2023 midpoint adjusted EBITDA outlook by $300 million. Scotto expects the Crestwood acquisition to offer commercial synergies. Further she pointed out that ET intends to maintain a strong balance sheet aiming for leverage of 4.0-4.5x debt/EBITDA. Also ET aims to continue to return cash to unitholders via increased distribution and potential buybacks. ""With high return growth projects accretive acquisitions and its integrated asset footprint across hydrocarbons and basins we believe ET can generate significant cash flow in the coming years"" said Scotto. Scotto increased her price target on Energy Transfer to $19 from $18 and reiterated a buy rating calling the stock a compelling investment opportunity. She ranks No. 54 among more than 8700 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been profitable 65% of the time with each delivering an average return of 18.1%. (See Energy Transfer Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks)

Sunoco LP

Scotto is also upbeat about another limited partnership: Sunoco (SUN) one of the leading motor fuel distributors in the U.S. For the third quarter Sunoco announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.8420 per unit paid on Nov. 20. The company's dividend yield stands at 6.3%. After Sunoco posted its quarterly results Scotto raised the price target for SUN stock to $57 from $51 to reflect a higher earnings outlook. The analyst reiterated a buy rating saying that the company's volumes and margins surpassed her estimates. The analyst thinks that the company's scale procurement ability and lower cost structure compared to the industry enable it to deliver beyond the industry's breakeven margin. ""SUN continues to maintain a strong balance sheet exiting 3Q23 with leverage of 3.9x and total liquidity of $1.1BN which provides SUN with significant financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities including acquisitions."" Overall Scotto remains bullish on Sunoco due to its solid cash flows and focus on breakeven margins and expense management. (See Sunoco Hedge Funds Trading Activity on TipRanks)

VICI Properties

Our next dividend stock is VICI Properties (VICI) a real estate investment trust. VICI owns a solid portfolio of gaming hospitality and entertainment properties including the properties of the iconic Caesars Palace Las Vegas and MGM Grand. For the third quarter the company declared a cash dividend of $0.415 per share reflecting a 6.4% increase. VICI offers a dividend yield of 5.4%. In a recent research note Stifel analyst Simon Yarmak who ranks 573rd out of more than 8700 analysts tracked by TipRanks reiterated a buy rating on VICI stock and called it one of his top ideas in the North American triple-net REITs sector. Yarmak noted that VICI has performed well in both gaming and non-gaming categories. He added that VICI's tenants remain in a strong position. ""VICI has negotiated favorable escalators in its leases which provide strong internal growth. Many of these escalators are linked to uncapped CPI growth (50.0% of rent) and therefore VICI should benefit from meaningful lease escalations in the above-average inflationary environment"" noted Yarmak. The analyst estimates that lease escalations would generate about $71 million of incremental rent in 2024 which was not captured in the 2023 results. He expects VICI to post some of the best year-over-year growth in 2024 in the triple-net sector with nearly 4.5% to 5.0% adjusted funds from operations growth. Yarmak's ratings have been successful 54% of the time with each one delivering an average return of 8%. (See VICI's Options Activity on TipRanks)

Home Depot

We move to home improvement retailer Home Depot (HD). The company exceeded analysts' fiscal third-quarter estimates despite a decline in sales due to pressure in certain big-ticket discretionary categories. However the company narrowed its full-year outlook due to macro pressures. For the third quarter the company declared a cash dividend of $2.09 per share payable on Dec. 14. HD's dividend yield stands at 2.6%. Following the fiscal third-quarter results JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers lowered the price target for HD stock to $318 from $332 but maintained a buy rating saying that Home Depot is managing well against a tough backdrop. The analyst thinks that management's tone was less optimistic versus the second quarter but not worse than the first quarter. While the home improvement category is expected to remain under pressure in the first half of 2024 comparable sales are projected to recover in the second half. ""We believe HD remains one of the best long-term stories in retail given company-specific sales and margin initiatives the duopoly/AMZN-resistant nature of the industry and significant financial and operating leverage that amplifies EPS growth in better sales environments"" said Horvers. Horvers ranks No. 520 among more than 8700 analysts on TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 61% of the time with each delivering an average return of 8%.

Nobody could find Roman Lopez.

His family had searched taping hand-drawn “missing” posters to telephone poles and driving the streets calling out the 11-year-old’s name. So had many of his neighbors their flashlights sweeping over the sidewalks as the winter darkness settled on the Sierra Nevada foothills.

The police were searching too and now they had returned to the place where Roman had gone missing earlier that day: his family’s rented home in Placerville Calif. Roman’s stepmother Lindsay Piper hesitated when officers showed up at her door the night of Jan. 11 2020 asking to comb the house again. But she had told them that Roman liked to hide in odd places — even the clothes dryer — and agreed to let them in.

Brock Garvin Roman’s 15-year-old stepbrother was sitting in the dimly lit basement when police came downstairs shortly after 10:30 p.m. He ignored them he said later watching “Supernatural” on television as three officers began inspecting the black-and-yellow Home Depot storage bins stacked along the back wall.

Brock had no idea what had happened to Roman. But he did know something the police did not: Much of what his mother had said to them that day was a lie.

When she reported Roman’s disappearance Piper told the police she was home schooling the eight kids in her household. This was technically true. It was also a ruse.

Most schools have teachers principals guidance counselors — professionals trained to recognize the unexplained bruises or erratic behaviors that may point to an abusive parent. Home education was an easy way to avoid the scrutiny of such people. That was the case for Piper whose children were learning less from her about math and history than they were about violence cruelty and neglect.

Left to their own devices while she lay in bed watching TV crime procedurals and her husband Jordan worked long hours as a utility lineman their days and nights passed in a penumbral blur of video games microwave dinners and fistfights. Almost nothing resembling education took place her sons said. But there was a shared project in which she diligently led her children: the torture of their stepbrother Roman.

Roman had been a loving extroverted 7-year-old who obsessed over dinosaurs when Piper came into his life a mama’s boy perpetually in search of a mother as Jordan his father cycled from one broken relationship to the next.

On the day he was reported missing he was a sixth-grader who weighed only 42 pounds. He had been locked in closets whipped with extension cords and bound with zip ties according to police reports and interviews with family members who witnessed his treatment. Unwilling to give him even short breaks from his isolation Piper kept him in diapers.

The Washington Post reconstructed Piper’s torment of her stepson from hundreds of pages of previously undisclosed law enforcement records as well as interviews with two of her four biological children other relatives friends of the family neighbors and police officers.

Piper 41 who is in prison did not respond to two letters requesting comment for this story. Her former public defender did not return calls or emails. Jordan Piper 38 also in prison declined a request to comment through his attorney.

Little research exists on the links between home schooling and child abuse. The few studies conducted in recent years have not shown that home-schooled children are at significantly greater risk of mistreatment than those who attend public private or charter schools.

But the research also suggests that when abuse does occur in home-school families it can escalate into especially severe forms — and that some parents exploit lax home education laws to avoid contact with social service agencies.

In 2014 a group of pediatricians published a study of more than two dozen tortured children treated at medical centers in Virginia Texas Wisconsin Utah and Washington. Among the 17 victims old enough to attend school eight were home-schooled.

After a home-schooling mother killed her autistic teenager government analysts in Connecticut gathered data from six school districts over three years. Their report released in 2018 by the state’s Office of the Child Advocate found that 138 of the 380 students withdrawn from public schools for home education during that period lived in households with at least one prior complaint of suspected abuse or neglect.

Child-welfare advocates have long pushed for a minimal level of oversight for home-schooled students — calls that have grown more urgent as home schooling has exploded becoming the country’s fastest growing form of education. But home-school parents arguing that serious episodes of abuse are rare have fiercely resisted. And nowhere have their efforts been more successful than in the state where Roman and his siblings spent most of their lives: Michigan.

Michigan is one of 11 states in which parents are not even required to tell anyone they are home schooling let alone demonstrate they are teaching their children anything. Its lack of regulation the result of a 1993 state Supreme Court decision still celebrated by home-school advocates has repeatedly concealed the actions of abusive parents like Piper.

“She told people we were home-schooled but we weren’t” Carson Garvin one of Roman’s stepbrothers now 16 later wrote in a victim impact statement. “Now I can see it wasn’t for us that she made this decision. It was to protect herself from the school counselors and staff. I believe that if we had went to school that someone would have had a feeling that something was off and that she would have been reported at some point.”

Despite what Piper told the police Roman had never really liked hiding. The truth was that he had been hidden. And home schooling is what allowed her to hide him.

As Brock Garvin sat in the basement watching TV on the night of Roman’s disappearance listening to the police officers banter as they opened the Tough Storage Tote bins he was in a fog. He had been up all night playing “Dark Souls” on his Xbox and was upset that he hadn’t been allowed to sleep for most of the day as he usually did.

He was also jarred by the entrance of unknown grown-ups into the house. The family had moved to California from Michigan just a few months earlier. Long isolated they were now strangers to everyone around them.

But Brock wasn’t worried about Roman. If his stepbrother had run away whatever he found could hardly be worse than what he had escaped.

Then the lid on one last bin snapped open and the officers’ laughter stopped.

Even in his benumbed state Brock felt something strange pass through the room as if the air pressure had suddenly dropped. It was quiet for a moment then the police began pulling on latex gloves.

‘I’ll behave’

Roman loved being alive. It was a strange thing to say about an infant but that was Jennifer Morasco’s first impression of the sunny 5-month-old boy who would become her stepson when she married Jordan Piper in 2010.

“He’d be teething but he wouldn’t cry” recalled Morasco now 41. “He was just so happy to be in existence and loved being around people and doing stuff with everyone.”

Roman’s mother Rochelle Lopez was a soldier who deployed to Iraq when he was 14 months old. After returning she struggled with heart problems anxiety and addiction to pain medication according to police records. Lopez who died in 2021 at age 34 fought with Jordan in court for years over custody of Roman.

But none of that seemed to weigh on the boy that Morasco largely raised until he was about 4 years old. Morasco still remembers the lyrics to “Life is a Highway” a song from Roman’s favorite movie “Cars” that he sang over and over. Another favorite was “Rainbow Connection” the banjo-accompanied Muppet ode to life’s unfulfilled promises.

“He thought he was Kermit the Frog essentially” Morasco said.

Even after Morasco left Jordan Piper she kept in touch with Roman calling every year on his birthday. But in 2016 Jordan wasn’t picking up his phone so she tried sending a Facebook message to Roman’s new stepmom asking her to tell him “he is loved all the way to the moon and back.”

Lindsay Piper reacted harshly warning Morasco not to contact her again and boasting that Roman “has excelled in ways I can’t begin to explain.”

Piper herself had barely graduated high school according to her sister Chanel Campbell. Her interest was never in academics; it was in babies. It wasn’t an unusual fixation for a young girl but there was something off-kilter about the intensity that Lindsay brought to her aspirations of motherhood her sister said.

“She carried a baby doll around with her until she was like 12” said Campbell who was raised with her sister in and around Flint. “She just had this fascination with baby dolls and dressing them up and changing them and putting them in diapers.” This treatment extended to the family’s miniature schnauzer which Lindsay forced into footed pajamas.

By the time she married Jordan Piper Lindsay had four children of her own. Their father Marcus Garvin was an infantryman in the Army and Army National Guard. He returned from his service in Iraq to years of marital turmoil with Lindsay who eventually gained full custody of their children. After marrying Jordan she became the parent of a fifth: her stepson Roman.

In Piper’s frequent Facebook posts they were a happily blended family all beaming smiles and matching flannel shirts. But Campbell knew this image was no more real than the dolls her sister had once carried around. At family gatherings Piper’s children tended to run wild and she responded in disturbing ways: pinching them or biting them on their forearms. When Campbell protested she said her sister would storm off.

Reached by phone Piper’s mother the guardian of Carson’s twin brother initially said she would consider speaking to The Post but did not respond to subsequent calls or text messages. Piper’s eldest daughter now 21 did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Press Enter to skip to end of carousel How this story was reported To reconstruct what happened to 11-year-old Roman Lopez Peter Jamison traveled to Flint Mich. conducting extensive interviews with Roman’s stepbrothers Brock and Carson Garvin and spending time with them and their father over several days. He visited the homes in Michigan where Roman lived with Lindsay and Jordan Piper interviewing former neighbors about the family. Jamison also met the three youngest of the eight children who were living with the Pipers when Roman disappeared and spoke with their current legal guardian. The portions of the story set in California were reported through interviews with Placerville law enforcement officers and community members and through police reports documenting the Lopez investigation. Text messages sent by or to Lindsay Piper were obtained from forensic imaging and analysis reports on the Piper family’s electronic devices that were created by the El Dorado County District Attorney’s Office. To understand the broader issues explored in this story Jamison examined the limited research that’s been done on the link between home-schooling and child abuse and spoke to child welfare experts and home-schooling advocates and critics. 1 / 4 End of carousel

Shortly after her marriage to Jordan Piper started to complain about her boys’ experience at their elementary school.

“She said ‘I’m just going to home-school them. I’m tired of the teachers singling them out. I’m tired of everyone picking on them’” Campbell recalled. “I thought to myself ‘You’re definitely right. We’ve got a problem here. But home schooling isn’t going to be the answer to it.’”

Between late 2016 and the summer of 2017 Piper withdrew the children from school Brock and Carson said. With the exception of a few brief interludes when they were sent back for days or weeks they would not regularly attend school again for the next five years.

At first they sporadically logged on to an online learning program Brock and Carson recalled. Then any pretense of education was dropped.

Piper spent the day watching “Criminal Minds” and “Law & Order” her sons said and in the evenings when Jordan returned from work the couple would sit around drinking Jack Daniels.

By this time the family had moved to Gaines a tiny town amid soybean fields about 20 miles southwest of Flint. At midday the sound of children at recess echoed past their house from the elementary school three blocks away. But for Piper’s kids the high-pitched laughter and shouting might as well have come from another planet.

“My world got very very small” recalled Brock who was then 12. “I wouldn’t see the sun or moon. I would just be in my room 24/7.” He at least had his Xbox; Carson had his twin brother. Roman had nothing and nobody because the things that made him human were methodically stripped away.

It happened slowly his stepbrothers said. Early on when the boys scuffled Piper blamed Roman the one to whom she had not given birth punishing him with lengthy timeouts. Then she began locking the door to his room. Then she began covering his window with a blanket.

“He would sit in the dark on his bed all day. And she would have us like scratch on the walls and make creepy noises so he’d think there’s demons trying to kill him” said Brock who expressed deep regret about participating. “He’d sit there and scream like ‘Stop it please’ or ‘I’ll behave’ … that was his life.”

Soon there was no disciplinary pretext for the harm inflicted on Roman Carson and Brock said. It was simply what the family did. Piper ordered her sons to join in when she whipped him with phone charger cords. Roman began trying to escape so she tied him down. She took away his clothes. Most of her kids were overweight but Roman was put on something worse than a starvation diet.

“She would feed him oatmeal with huge amounts of salt in it” Carson said. “He puked it up so he wouldn’t have to keep eating it. And she would make him eat his puke.”

Campbell suspected there was something badly wrong inside her sister’s house. She said that after seeing bruises on Roman’s face at a Christmas get-together in 2016 she called child protective services.

She made two follow-up calls she said but could never determine whether any action was taken. Police later said they found no records of CPS investigations into Piper’s treatment of Roman. A spokesman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services — which oversees such investigations — declined to comment citing the confidentiality of child-welfare cases.

Roman kept appearing in Piper’s Facebook photos increasingly wraithlike beside his grinning siblings.

“He was just lifeless just sad. You could just see it in his face aside from the puffy eyes and the bruising on his forehead” Campbell said. “The love had been sucked out of him.”

It seemed unimaginable that a child could fall so completely through the safety net because a parent like Piper decided to home-school. But in Michigan it had happened before.

‘A shield for child abuse’

About two years before Roman was withdrawn from school an eviction crew entered Mitchelle Blair’s Detroit apartment on March 24 2015. The 35-year-old mother of four wasn’t home so they began removing her furniture. But their work came to an abrupt halt when they opened a deep freezer in the living room: inside were the bodies of two children.

Stoni Blair and Stephen Berry — estimated to have been ages 13 and 9 when their mother killed them — had been pulled out of Detroit public schools with their siblings two years earlier. During Blair’s conviction and sentencing to life in prison for first-degree murder it emerged that she had burned her children with scalding water and beaten them with wooden planks.

She also claimed to be home-schooling them.

Stephanie Chang then a freshman Democratic state representative whose district included the site of the murders was horrified by the case. She was also alarmed by what she perceived as a yawning gap in the state’s child protection system.

It wasn’t just Stoni and Stephen. Seven years earlier there had been Calista Springer a home-schooled 16-year-old who died in a house fire in Centreville Mich. unable to free herself from a choke chain her parents used to tie her to her bed. Marsha and Anthony Springer were convicted of torture and child abuse and sentenced to lengthy prison sentences.

Chang understood such cases didn’t represent most children’s home-schooling experiences. But she also believed abusive parents were taking advantage of Michigan’s absence of any notification or monitoring requirements for home educators with devastating consequences.

“There are so many amazing home-school parents who I have so much respect for. But when people use home schooling as a shield for child abuse that’s not acceptable” said Chang now a state senator. “That lack of a notification requirement creates an environment where parents can basically just do whatever they want.”

It is a concern that extends beyond Michigan and that pediatricians share with politicians.

In 2013 a group of North Carolina doctors published case studies on “invisible children” who suffered severe abuse while being home-schooled. They acknowledged that “home-school advocates may feel unjustly linked to child abuse” but advised state officials to consider a better registration system and additional oversight measures such as home visits.

“Home schooling at times can allow parents to create this isolation of the child” said Meggan Goodpasture an associate professor of pediatrics at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine and lead author of the case studies. “What we do know is that school personnel are big reporters statistically speaking of abuse and neglect.”

A month after Mitchelle Blair’s children were discovered dead in Detroit Chang introduced a bill requiring that parents notify their local school district of a decision to home-school and that home-schooled children meet at least twice a year with a mandated child abuse reporter such as a teacher doctor or psychologist.

“It’s such a common-sense thing in my view” Chang said.

The legislation was supported by the state board of education which said it had “long been concerned that there is no way to know who is being homeschooled.” But home-schoolers in Michigan — and across the country — fought back.

Chang’s office was flooded with hundreds of calls. Angry home-school parents from around the state started showing up at her fellow legislators’ constituent coffee hours. The nation’s most powerful home-school advocacy group the Home School Legal Defense Association attacked the proposal from its headquarters in Northern Virginia.

The bill never got a hearing. Israel Wayne vice president of the Michigan Christian Homeschool Network — the state’s oldest and largest home-schooling group — said that’s a good thing.

“Families should be prosecuted if they are abusing their children. But we have very adequate abuse laws that are already on the books” Wayne said. “Our view would be that to create additional burdens and regulations and red tape for all home-schoolers in the state is not productive and would not reduce child abuse.”

Wayne said the deaths of Stoni Blair and Stephen Berry resulted not from home schooling but from failures of the state’s child protective services workers who had investigated their mother repeatedly before their deaths. And in the eight years since their murders he added “you have not heard of any home-schooling families abusing their children” in Michigan.

Wayne said he had never heard of Roman Lopez who was as invisible to his state’s home-schooling community as he was to everyone else.

A boy is found

Detective Luke Gadow stared at the child who lay curled on his right side at the bottom of a 55-gallon storage container in the Pipers’ Placerville basement.

The boy was gaunt and wore nothing but a diaper. His exposed skin had taken on a chalky hue and some blood had dribbled from his nose. One of the police officers with Gadow knelt and placed his fingers on the child’s neck confirming what they knew already: Roman Lopez was dead.

Lindsay and Jordan Piper were taken to the police department for questioning the children to an emergency youth shelter. In addition to her four biological children and Roman there were three other young children living in the Piper home — the oldest was 7 — who Piper said had been left in her care by a struggling friend in Flint.

Everyone in the family told investigators they had no idea how Roman wound up dead in the basement records of their interviews show.

Piper described herself as “a full-time mother” who “taught their children through home schooling.” But something seemed wrong. The kids’ statements were so similar that Gadow suspected they had been coached. Before the body was found Piper had been unable to furnish any recently worn clothes of Roman’s that might provide a scent for a search-and-rescue dog not even shoes.

“I had a bad feeling” Gadow now a police sergeant later recalled. “You know the little spidey senses tingling.”

That feeling was confirmed as photos videos and text messages — described in forensic analysis reports obtained by The Post — were pulled from the family’s phones and laptops.

In one video a woman who sounded like Piper was yelling at Roman calling him a “retard” and saying “I want to punch you in the face.” In a text to her teenage daughter Piper wrote “And Roman is a dick! I’m excited to come back to whoop that ass lol.” A photo on Piper’s phone showed Roman naked in a closet his arms zip-tied to metal grid shelves.

Sometimes the family casually discussed their concern that while they slept Roman was escaping from his confinement to scavenge once eating a packet of raw ramen. In July 2019 before they left Michigan Brock texted his mother.

Brock I think Roman gets out Piper Oh no lol how? Brock I don’t know but food is missing

Piper’s text messages to her daughter also shed light on a question that bedeviled the early phase of the investigation: how exactly Roman died. The medical examiner in El Dorado County determined that while he was dehydrated and severely malnourished — at 11 Roman weighed about as much as a 6-year-old — he had no obvious wounds.

Murder would be difficult to prove without a cause of death. Then one day Gadow was going over Roman’s toxicology report painstakingly checking the levels of every substance found in his blood. One was elevated far above a safe range: sodium.

Roman had been poisoned with table salt investigators concluded a substance so commonplace that it had almost been overlooked. Sure enough Piper had left a trail of text messages to her daughter discussing plans to add extra salt to Roman’s food. Roman’s final hours were not pleasant to contemplate: Excess blood sodium or hypernatremia can lead to seizures delirium and finally death.

The investigation had taken time — delayed in part by the start of the pandemic but also by the case’s complexity and the family’s lack of cooperation. And Roman was not the only victim in the house.

One of the three young children Piper had informally adopted showed severe bruising on her hips and buttocks. A search of Jordan’s devices revealed that he had installed a hidden camera in the bathroom and recorded his teen stepdaughter showering according to forensic reports.

In February 2021 — just over a year after Roman’s death — Lindsay and Jordan Piper were arrested at a motel in rural Calaveras County Calif.

Lindsay pleaded no contest to a charge of second-degree murder last year and was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison. Jordan pleaded guilty in October to the same charge and is awaiting sentencing. He is already serving a 15-year sentence after pleading guilty to a federal charge of sexually exploiting a child.

Jordan’s mother Jackie Farah told The Post that Jordan should have protected Roman but that he does not share Lindsay’s culpability in his son’s death.

“He is guilty for what he didn’t do not for what he did do” Farah said. “He is not the monster that put my grandchild in that damn box.”

The eight children in the Piper household were scattered. The three youngest were sent to live with an aunt in Michigan. Lindsay’s eldest daughter — now raising a young child of her own — returned to the Flint area. Carson’s twin went to live with Lindsay’s mother.

Brock and Carson were placed with their father who hadn’t been part of their lives in a long time. What lay ahead seemed almost as terrifying as what they’d left behind.

It was time for them to go back to school.

School day

Just before 6 a.m. on a fall Tuesday a bleary-eyed Carson trudged down the stairs of his home in Davison Mich. and pulled on a pair of Nikes. His half sister Reagan 9 was at the kitchen counter bent over a worksheet titled “Angles and Quadrilaterals.” He glanced at her as he began rinsing plates in the sink.

“Reagan can you unload the dishwasher?”

“I’m busy right now” she replied.

“What are you doing?”

“My homework. I didn’t have time to do it last night.”

Ginger the family’s dog watched the exchange from the living room wagging her tail as she perched over a Joe Biden chew toy. The dog was in high spirits: She loved a full house and Brock was home on leave from his Army base in New York.

“I’ll tell Brock” Carson warned. “He’s going to send you to jail.”

“He can’t do that.”

From the basement Brock’s sleepy voice called up: “You’re going to jail!”

“I know you’re lying to me” Reagan called back.

It was late September more than three years after the body of Brock’s and Carson’s stepbrother had been found in another basement in a very different house.

In that other home the boys had slept as late as they wanted often into the afternoon. In this one the sun wasn’t up when Carson rose from bed to begin his school day.

Marcus Garvin had not seen his sons in five years when Piper’s sister called him with the news that Roman had been found dead. He filed an emergency petition in Michigan to regain custody but it was not until after his ex-wife’s arrest that the boys were sent to live with him and Reagan his daughter from another marriage.

In a video call shortly before he flew to California Garvin a muscular and thickly tattooed 42-year-old warned Brock and Carson that their lives would soon be changing.

Story continues below advertisement Advertisement Story continues below advertisement Advertisement

“You’re going to school every day” he said. “Like a normal kid.”

Carson held himself together until they were off the call then turned to Brock.

“I don’t think I can do this” he said.

But he could.

In Davison a middle-class Flint suburb of aboveground pools and heavily attended high school football games Garvin began to lead his two obese sons on jogs around the neighborhood. He enrolled them in therapy three times a week. Gradually they returned to healthy weights and healthy routines. Carson enrolled at Davison Middle School then at Davison High. He got A’s and B’s and joined the high school soccer team.

Brock’s path was less straightforward. The last time he had regularly sat in a classroom he was 12. When he came to live with his dad he was 17. He had no realistic way to prepare for his senior year of high school so he worked online toward a GED. On his third attempt he passed and then he joined the Army becoming a military police officer.

“It’s kind of a way to help even out what Lindsay did” he said recently describing his aspirations for a career in law enforcement. “I want to be able to help people.”

But Brock like his brother still struggles with the memory of the person he did not help. Honesty is a trait Garvin encourages in his rescued sons and they say the truth is that they bear some responsibility for what happened to Roman.

“I could have stopped it and that’s just what gets me” Brock said. “At any moment if I wasn’t so content sitting and playing video games all day — like I could have called the cops.”

In his statement at his mother’s sentencing hearing — read aloud on his behalf because he was unable to speak through his tears — Carson wrestled with his complicated role as both victim and accomplice.

“I was afraid at the time that if I didn’t do what she told me to do it would be me locked in that box or closet next” he wrote. “I participated in this abuse and I cannot ever go back in time and find the strength to stand up to her.”

Garvin marvels at how his sons have thrived in a world of schedules and expectations. Brock’s enlistment filled him with pride. Carson had come a long way from the days when the sight of a school bus was enough to send him running into the house in panic.

But as a combat veteran of the Iraq War Garvin knows that trauma’s effects are long-lasting and not always predictable. The boys he says “were both very close to not having a future.”

The street was dark and quiet when Carson slipped out the front door about 6:15 a.m. munching on a hastily assembled sandwich of Country Crock and wheat toast. He walked to the corner in their newly built subdivision stepping around a child’s bike that had been left on the sidewalk.

Headlights swept the sides of houses as cars eased out of their driveways. Carson watched in silence as a new and larger set of headlights appeared at the end of the block and a moment later he boarded a yellow bus with black letters across its side: “Davison Community Schools.”

The company known for its expertise in sustainability directed about 60% of its 2022 new product research and development investments toward outcomes aligned with environmental social and governance (ESG) goals. Honeywell also specializes in advanced automation solutions that help its customers improve efficiency in energy use and operational management.

""China's decarbonization goals bring industry challenges in terms of emission reduction but also provide opportunities for technological innovation and applications for enterprises in the supply chain to strengthen sustainable development practices"" said William Yu president of Honeywell China.

As a long-standing proponent and facilitator of sustainability Honeywell expects to use the CISCE as a platform to enhance cooperation and work with additional industry partners in China. The goal is to develop a supply chain ecosystem that is resilient agile and sustainable according to Yu.

During the five-day event Honeywell displayed its sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) solutions compatible with a wide range of renewable feedstocks. The company also showcased sensors designed for electric vehicle applications to monitor current speed and thermal runaway as well as its Solstice 1234yf automotive refrigerant. This refrigerant based on next-generation Hydrofluoroolefin (HFO) technology has an ultra-low global warming potential (GWP less than 1).

Additionally Honeywell's booth highlighted the company's refinery solutions which employ advanced process technologies to assist refineries in transitioning into integrated petrochemical enterprises. The display also included smart factory solutions that enhance the safety efficiency and reliability of industrial operations by connecting processes assets and people.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ib21iYXJkaWVyLWNoYWxsZW5nZXItaW1wcm92ZW1lbnRzLTMwMC0zNTAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Bombardier Improved On The Challenger 300 To Make The 350,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9ib21iYXJkaWVyLWNoYWxsZW5nZXItaW1wcm92ZW1lbnRzLTMwMC0zNTAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5a29zLmNvbS9zdG9yaWVzLzIwMjMvMTIvMy8yMjA5NTI5Ly1UaGUtUXVhbnR1bS1Db21wdXRpbmctUmV2b2x1dGlvbi1vbi02MC1NaW51dGVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Quantum Computing Revolution on 60 Minutes,"On CBS 60 Minutes tonight there was a fascinating look at the quantum computing revolution currently being developed at places like Google IBM Microsoft and Honeywell. Unlike conventional computers using transistors in which each “bit” of information is binary (‘0’ or ‘1’) quantum computers use superconducting “qubits” at a temperature near absolute zero (-460F) in which individual electrons can store information over an infinite range of values so linking these qubits permits an exponential increase in computing power rather than just a linear increase with transistors. For example while we can now produce computer chips containing over a trillion transistors an equivalent quantum computing power can be obtained with just 40 qubits linked together (2^40).

The main technological challenge is maintaining a quantum coherence between these qubits but tomorrow IBM will be unveiling its Quantum System Two which has three times the number of qubits as its first prototype. Some of the key exchanges from the 60 Minutes piece:

Mitigating those errors and extending coherence time while scaling up to larger machines are the challenges facing German-American scientist Hartmut Neven who founded Google's lab and its casual style in 2012. Scott Pelley: Can the problems that are in the way of quantum computing be solved? Hartmut Neven: I should confess my subtitle here is chief optimist. After having said this I would say at this point we don't need any more fundamental breakthroughs. We need little improvements here and there. If we have all the pieces together we just need to integrate them well to build larger and larger systems. Scott Pelley: And you think that all of this will be integrated into a system in what period of time? Hartmut Neven: Yeah. We often say we wanna do it by the end of the decade so that we can use this Kennedy quote ""Get it done by the end of the decade."" Scott Pelley: The end of this decade? Hartmut Neven: Yes. … IBM's Dario Gil told us System Two has the room to expand to thousands of qubits. Scott Pelley: What are the chances that this is one of those things that's gonna be ready in five years and always will be? Dario Gil: We don't see an obstacle right now that would prevent us from building systems that will have tens of thousands and even a 100 thousand qubits working with each other. So we are highly confident that we will get there.

This is a truly mind-blowing look at the future of computing and the implications are absolutely staggering. For more background info on this subject I would recommend Michio Kaku’s Quantum Supremacy."

Plant-based meat market 2023-2027: Drivers and challenges

The new product launches are notably driving the market growth. Due to the growing health awareness of consumers and environmental concerns the demand for plant-based meat products is increasing. To meet the growing demand for plant-based meat products vendors around the world are launching new products. Successful new product launches increase suppliers' revenue streams and market share. One such new product launch includes two new iterations of its plant-based burger with one version offering a more meaty experience and the other being a more nutritious version of its burger by Beyond Meat. Such factors will drive market growth during the forecast period.

However increasing consumption of animal meat is a major challenge impeding the market growth. Consumption of meat such as pork beef and chicken is increasing in several countries such as the United States China India and Russia. In quantitative terms the US was the largest beef market in 2020. Beef consumption in the US grew significantly between 2019 and 2020. Quantitatively chicken consumption increased by more than 2% in the United States and 1% in China in 2019-2020. Thus increasing consumption of animal meat products will negatively affect the growth of the global market during the forecast period.

Retirees tend to favor year-round warm climates. Minnesota’s winters are famously frigid.

Retirees prefer states tax structures friendly to them. Minnesota taxes most forms of retirement income including Social Security retirement benefits.

On the brighter side if you enjoy four-season living and can manage those taxes the North Star State does offer: a relatively low cost of living low crime rates overall and natural beauty including — famously — a LOT of lakes.

For a sense of that low cost of living check out GOBankingRates’ list of the top 10 Minnesota cities for retired couples living only on Social Security checks.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023. The REIT anticipates net income between $708 million and $794 million and adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization for real estate between $1.59 billion and $1.68 billion.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

(NYSE:HWM) is a favorite amongst the big guns,"Key Insights

Institutions' substantial holdings in Howmet Aerospace implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price

A total of 13 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership

Using data from alongside ownership research one can better assess the future performance of a company

If you want to know who really controls Howmet Aerospace Inc. ( ) then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 88% stake institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight especially with individual investors. Therefore a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.

Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Howmet Aerospace beginning with the chart below.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Howmet Aerospace?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register especially if they are growing.

Howmet Aerospace already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Howmet Aerospace's historic earnings and revenue below but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company so they can collectively wield significant power. Howmet Aerospace is not owned by hedge funds. The Vanguard Group Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 11% of shares outstanding. BlackRock Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 9.1% of common stock and Massachusetts Financial Services Company holds about 5.7% of the company stock. Additionally the company's CEO John Plant directly holds 0.8% of the total shares outstanding.

Looking at the shareholder registry we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 13 shareholders meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of Howmet Aerospace

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

We can see that insiders own shares in Howmet Aerospace Inc.. Insiders own US$231m worth of shares (at current prices). we sometimes take an interest in

General Public Ownership

With a 11% ownership the general public mostly comprising of individual investors have some degree of sway over Howmet Aerospace. This size of ownership while considerable may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company there are other factors that are even more important. For example we've discovered that you should be aware of before investing here.

The HCP market in the region registered 6.9 million units shipped in 3Q23 – the lowest shipment recorded in the post-pandemic period. The total HCP market across multiple countries remained pressured by macroeconomic factors which weakened the demand for both consumer and commercial segments. Breaking down the YoY performance of each product type: total Inkjet portion declined by 15.1%; Laser devices including A4 and A3 machines declined by 13.5%; and Serial Dot Matrix (SDM) segment declined by 26.4%.

In most of the sub-regions like ANZ ASEAN Greater China and India ink cartridge shipments witnessed a notable decline. This was primarily due to slower-than-anticipated ink cartridge replacement rates by home users. Conversely the ink tank segment captured YoY growth in countries like Australia Philippines Bangladesh Indonesia and India due to the growing acceptance in major verticals such as healthcare and education in a predominantly small and medium business (SMB) driven market.

In Q3 both laser A4 and A3 markets declined significantly with the A3 market declining by 18.7% and A4 by 12.8%. This was largely due to a subdued demand from SMBs and small offices/home offices (SOHOs) remained soft in many countries compounded by the global economic hurdles which further tightened their business spending. However India stood out in the APeJ region being the only country to achieve a YoY growth for both laser printers and copiers primarily driven by large government tender fulfilments ahead of the anticipated general election in Q2 2024.""Despite total unit shipments for laser products being lower than forecasted we anticipate that demand will recover in certain countries in the short run as government and business spending will pick up again in tandem with economic recovery"" says Yi Karl Tai Research Analyst IDC Asia Pacific.

Top Three (3) Home/Office Printer Brand Highlights:

• HP once again crossed the 30% market share threshold despite a slight decrease in shipments. With new projects secured from the private and public sectors in 3Q23 HP maintained their steadfast position. The highest YoY growth was seen in Vietnam and Sri Lanka.

• Epson had a slight edge over Canon in Q3 compared to a tie in the previous quarter. Epson continued to lead the ink tank segment thanks to widening acceptance of ink tank models in the larger market particularly among SMBs and home users. This quarter the Philippines recorded the highest YoY growth followed by Bangladesh and Indonesia.

• Canon placed third in 3Q23 with a slight YoY drop in total unit shipments. With stronger demand in healthcare manufacturing and education for their laser products and the rollout of more inkjet models in their continued shift from ink cartridge to ink tank models Canon managed to keep their growth in parts of Asia. The highest YoY growth occurred in Malaysia followed by India and Korea.

“In line with IDC’s prediction we see Q3 shipments smoothening before the end of 2023 where shipments are expected to rebound in Q4. We expect the shift from ink cartridges to ink tanks will continue as ink tank models increase in popularity across sub-regions like ANZ ASEAN and major markets like China and India. End users are making this transition to increase efficiency in printing in line with an increasing awareness of ESG” says Leonard Adiarto Sudjono Senior Research Analyst at IDC Asia Pacific.

It was only 88 feet long by 21.5 feet wide. It had but a single cabin with a pilothouse above that and mounted forward. A straight “stovepipe” smokestack used by Nabrico on their boats of that era was located behind the pilothouse. A tall mast was mounted at the after end of the cabin and there was a long rudder deck behind the cabin.

The small boat was of all-steel construction and had a single prop. The machinery located in the engineroom is where the innovation was found. For power the boat had the first river application of a General Motors Cleveland diesel engine. This was a relatively new engine manufacturer and was the diesel engine division of the General Motors Corporation located in Cleveland Ohio. The 12-cylinder engine was rated at 750 hp. at 600 rpm. At the time this was considered to be a “high speed” engine. The diesel engines that powered prop towboats then were large slow-speed engines. Most engines in boats similar to the Bull Calf and of comparable horsepower were direct-reversing turned about 250 rpm. and were connected directly to the shaft.

The high-speed Cleveland diesel on the Bull Calf was connected to a new clutch and gear device that had been jointly developed by the Falk Corporation and General Tire & Rubber Company. Known as an Airflex clutch and reverse gear it allowed the engine to turn at the higher speed and in one direction while reversing was accomplished through the rubber clutches and the gearing system. Trials were held at Nashville on June 14 1939 and witnesses claimed that the 133-ton towboat was able to go from full ahead to full astern in just under 3 seconds. Any pilot who has handled a direct-reversible boat knows that this was quite an improvement.

At the time of the trials it was said that the boat and machinery combination would “quickly go down in history as opening a new chapter in the successful application of high-speed engines to heavy-duty service.” A General Motors ad in the September 9 1939 issue of The Waterways Journal featured the new Bull Calf and termed it “a towboat with showboat performance.”

The Bull Calf was owned by Canal Barge Company of New Orleans then a fairly new concern that was founded in 1933 by Joseph Merrick Jones with one barge. The boat was designed to move tows of 40000 barrels of petroleum between New Orleans and Memphis. In 1945 Nabrico would build a slightly larger single-screw boat for General Motors that was named Codrington in honor of GM Cleveland Diesels Vice President G.W. Codrington. This 1200 hp. vessel was leased to Canal.

The Falk Airflex clutch did catch on with the industry though it took some time before it was the standard. Direct-reversing towboats were still quite common on the rivers into the 1970s.

Canal rebuilt the Bull Calf in 1959 at which time it was converted to a retractable-pilothouse vessel. The stack was shortened and streamlined and the cabin was extended back over the rudder deck. At some point it was repowered with a GM EMD 12-567 diesel of 900 hp.

In 1961 Canal Barge had two new 4300 hp. towboats built by Southern Shipbuilding Slidell La. the Leonidas Polk and Ned Merrick. At the same time the Bull Calf was transferred to Southern Shipbuilding. In 1966 it was sold to Tennemo Towing Company Inc. Caruthersville Mo. and operated by Southern Towing Company. In 1969 it was sold to Wm. C. Ellis & Sons Memphis. It was last listed in the combined 1988-1989 edition of the Inland River Record and was in the Off The Record section of the 1990 book due to having not operated in several years.

According to the Canal Barge website the company now has more than 800 barges and 43 towboats. In 1995 Canal Barge acquired the 2100 hp. Matador XVI which company representatives promptly renamed Bull Calf after the innovative little boat that had done so much both for Canal and the industry as a whole.

If you get to know me you’d learn I developed two obsessions over three years writing with Laptop Mag: Handheld gaming devices and OLED panels. While the former isn’t relevant to this review the latter is something I get obsessive about when reviewing the latest tech. In fact the Lenovo Yoga 9i is my favorite laptop of 2023 and that’s partially thanks to its stunning OLED display.

Imagine my surprise when pulling the sleek premium HP Envy x360 from its box only to learn it boasts a similarly stunning OLED panel for less than some competitors. And I’m happy to report that the Envy x360 accomplishes more than just having a vivid display. Built with a sturdy aluminum chassis and sporting solid productivity performance a satisfying keyboard and a clear webcam this is one of the best 2-in-1 laptops you can buy.

HP Envy x360 2-in-1 price and specifications

My Envy x360 review unit comes with an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor 16GB of RAM 1TB of SSD storage AMD Radeon integrated graphics a 15.6-inch 1920 x 1080-pixel OLED touchscreen and Windows 11 Home . While it’s typically $1199 it is currently available for $799 through a Cyber Monday deal on HP’s store .

The base model brings the price down to $899 instead featuring an AMD Ryzen 5 7530 processor 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD storage and a 15.6-inch 1920 x 1080-pixel IPS touchscreen. An Intel version is also available which tops out at the same $1199 as my review unit and features an Intel Core i7-1355U processor 16GB of RAM 1TB of SSD storage and a 1920 x 1080-pixel IPS screen. Sorry Intel fans no OLED for you.

HP Envy x360 2-in-1 design

Screaming thin sleekness during every stage of my testing the Envy x360 balances the joys of minimalism with an alluring luster that cannot be denied. Its stunning Nightfall aluminum chassis and lid feels premium to touch while the rectangular hinges at the back give it a uniform edgeless look. It also features an HP reflective logo at the center although it’s a tad hard to see without light due to the laptop’s dark gray finish.

Lifting the lid reveals a large touchpad and keyboard with two wide speakers on both ends. For environment-conscious individuals its speaker enclosures and bezels are built with recycled ocean-bound plastic while recycled aluminum is used for the product cover and post-consumer recycled plastic in the keyboard caps.

A key component for every 2-in-1 is a pair of hinges sturdy enough so I don’t get a heart attack when swapping it to tabletop mode. And thankfully from my testing its hinges are strong and more than capable of supporting its own weight.

Coming in at 14.1 x 9 x 0.7 inches and 4.03 pounds it’s lighter when compared to the Lenovo Yoga 7i (14.3 x 9.8 x 0.7 inches 4.5 pounds) and Dell Inspiron 16 2-in-1 (14.1 x 9.9 x 0.6~0.7 inches 4.6 pounds) are the largest and heaviest. The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 (11.5 x 7.9 x 0.3 inches 2.9 pounds) is the lightest.

HP Envy x360 2-in-1 ports

The Envy x360 should satisfy most in the ports department but if you’re in need of more we recommend taking a look at our best docking stations . On its left side it has a USB Type-A audio jack port and SD card reader. On its right there’s two USB Type-C ports  an HDMI port and another USB Type-A. We only wish it had a Thunderbolt 4 port.

HP Envy x360 2-in-1 display

There’s only one thing I love more than an OLED display  and that’s scrutinizing them. After all if you’re promising me the unmatched beauty of OLED I’d better walk away impressed. But thankfully this glossy 15.6-inch  1920 x 1080-pixel OLED touchscreen looks damned good.

I watched the trailer for “The Marsh King’s Daughter” and was impressed by the panel’s contrast. A wide array of light and dark greens were distinguishable within the trees in the background while the shadowy nothingness interspersed between branches had an inky quality that captivated my eye.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag/Momo Tabari)

I then jumped to a trailer for “Monarch: Legacy of Monsters” and was completely sucked into scenes of cataclysmic destruction unleashed by the one and only Godzilla. The show’s tangible dreariness came across excellently with this display as even when gray ashy remains of a civilization were all that’s left to look at each hue was accompanied by an alluring depth.

As expected of an OLED display the Envy x360 did great in our color tests reproducing 128.1% of the DCI-P3 color gamut  which absolutely smashes the category average (85.5%). The XPS 13 (70.9%) Inspiron 16 (69.5%) and Yoga 7i (45.8%) didn’t stand a chance

I'm impressed by the Envy x360’s performance in our brightness tests reaching an average of 378 nits which is quite a bit above the category average (353 nits). This isn’t amazing in a general sense especially when compared to other laptops in the category but it’s great for an OLED laptop as these are generally dimmer. It got demolished by the XPS 13 (482 nits) but the Inspiron 16 (307 nits) and Yoga 7i (267 nits) were quite a bit behind.

HP Envy x360 2-in-1 keyboard and touchpad

The Envy x360’s backlit keyboard doesn’t consume the full deck thanks to a couple of inches of speakers on both sides. It also doesn’t have a number pad so if that’s a deal breaker for you you might want to look at a 2-in-1 like the Lenovo Yoga 7i .

(Image credit: Laptop Mag/Momo Tabari)

Beyond that it features a suite of useful quick access keys with F12 revealing options between opening HP Command Center OMEN Gaming Hub and myHP. Its F1 key quickly brings up an emoji menu which is admittedly adorable. There are function keys for changing volume and brightness muting the microphone and swapping between key backlight brightness. It also has a dedicated print screen key alongside a pause fast forward and rewind.

I took the 10fastfingers test and managed a 100% accuracy with 110 words per minute. While this is a little slower than my typical 120 to 130 words per minute on my mechanical keyboard  the accuracy showcases my comfort with the device.

The 3.3 x 5.1-inch touchpad is surprisingly loud emitting a resounding click during my use. Beyond that it lacks smoothness. I have to push against it just to open files browse the web or move folders around. Multi-finger gestures are at least easy to pull off as swapping between tabs using three fingers was no issue at all.

HP Envy x360 2-in-1 audio

I had high hopes for the Envy x360’s audio with its top-firing speakers on both sides of the keyboard. After all the curse of the bottom firing speaker is one I’m wary of and always emit a sigh of relief when I see laptops with speakers on top. Unfortunately this seems to be an exception to the rule as this system is quiet and lacking bass.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag/Momo Tabari)

I listened to my latest obsession “Phantom Liberty” by Dawid Podsiadlo and P.T. Adamczyk to see how these speakers held up. The opening was notably underwhelming as the sporadic heartbeat and piano keys lacked impact. While it presented the vocals of the track clearly when the percussion appears a couple of minutes into the song I wished it had more punchiness. The system lacks a sufficient amount of bass and I wish it could be louder to accompany its most intense moments but it sounds clear enough to get the job done.

I watched the trailer for “The Marsh King’s Daughter” and found it to be lacking as everything from characters speaking to the backing soundtrack sounded faint. There’s a surprising flatness to everything whether it was the sound of sirens gun fire or two people slamming against one another. It was as if the laptop was constantly at 20% volume even while at max.

HP Envy x360 2-in-1 performance

The Envy x360 2-in-1 is built with an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor 16GB of RAM  and 1TB of SSD storage. These specs are great for handling the average user’s productivity tasks and while it won’t be able to do any heavy lifting it’s great for its price. I was easily able to pull up dozens of YouTube  Twitch  Google Docs  and Sheets tabs without it ever stuttering.

(Image credit: Laptop Mag/Momo Tabari)

Performing well enough on the Geekbench 5.5 overall performance test the Envy x360 achieved a multi-core score of 7748 which is less than the 7469 average. This is also behind the XPS 13 (Intel Core i5-1230U 7097) and Inspiron 16 (Intel Core i7-1260P 6757) but the Yoga 7i (Intel Core i7-1335U 8663) pulled into first place.

It did a good bit better on the Handbrake test converting a 4K video to 1080p resolution in 7 minutes and 30 seconds which is faster than the 9 minute and 19 second category average. The XPS 13 (8:33) Inspiron 16 (11:27) Yoga 7i (10:30) were slower.

Duplicating 25GB of multimedia files in 22 seconds for a 1245 megabytes per second transfer rate it continued to do rather well surpassing the category average of 1021MBps. The XPS 13 (512GB SSD 648.7MBps) and Inspiron 16 (512GB SSD 802MBps) couldn’t compete but the Yoga 7i (512GB 1380MBps) had the fastest conversion rate.

HP Envy x360 2-in-1 graphics

The Envy x360 isn’t a gaming laptop  but we tested Sid Meier’s Civilization VI at 1080p and it managed 42 frames per second which is the littlest bit below the category average (44 fps). The XPS 13 (60 fps) did significantly better even with its integrated graphics but the Inspiron 16 (19 fps) and Yoga 7i (25 fps) were quite a bit behind.

On the 3D Mark Fire Strike synthetic benchmark test the Envy x360 managed a score of 3872. This is way worse than the 6613 category average The XPS 13 (3051) was by far the worst. The Inspiron 16 (3869) performed nearly identically while the Yoga 7i (5027) was the best of the bunch.

With its surprising 2K webcam the Envy x360 did a decent job representing the deep pink hue of my wall while maintaining the light blue of my shirt without it turning into a colorless mess. While the light from my lamp looked a little overexposed I was pretty impressed with the crispness of its 2560 x 1440-pixel image.

It also features a camera privacy shutter that can be slid into place above the webcam. You probably won’t need one of our best webcams with something that looks this good.

The Envy x360 remained cool throughout most of the system in our lab testing with the touchpad hitting 79 degrees fahrenheit while the G/H key and underside were only 86 degrees remaining far below our 95-degree comfort threshold. However the F12 key hit an alarming 113 degrees but during my personal usage I never felt uncomfortable from its heat.

Polyphony Digital’s Gran Turismo series has evolved into much more than a racing simulator for automakers who use the Vision GT concepts to showcase the wildest dreams of their designers. The new Genesis X Gran Berlinetta does exactly that incorporating the latest version of the Athletic Elegance styling language without the limitations of a production vehicle.

While some Vision GT concepts remained digital-only affairs Genesis built a full-scale prototype of the X Gran Berlinetta formally unveiling it today at the GT World Series Finals in Barcelona.

The new concept is an exotic hypercar designed for racing although if you ask us it wouldn’t look out of place at Pebble Beach. The low-slung body with the long hood and the cab-backward proportions is full of sexy curves and nicely integrated intakes contributing to a drag coefficient of 0.34 cd. Genesis’ signature Quad Lights go around the Crest grille and extend to the profile making sure that the concept won’t go unnoticed in combination with the striking Magma color and the massive center-lock wheels. The rear end is dominated by an elliptical shape interrupted by the large diffuser with an F1-style brake light.

The interior successfully manages to combine a luxurious ambiance with motorsport-derived features in a minimalist and uncluttered way. The centerpiece is a digital panoramic interface mounted on the base of the windshield. Besides displaying the essential information it also improves visibility showing feed from the surrounding digital monitoring system.

Genesis designers gave emphasis on the touch points with luxurious-looking knobs on the yoke steering wheel door cards and dashboard. Last but not least the heavily bolstered seats are quilted and padded infusing a little bit of Genesis G90 flair into the carbon-fiber cockpit of this wild hypercar.

Massive Amounts Of Hybrid Power To Match Its Looks

The company shared the concept’s specifications but the promised performance figures are destined for the virtual realm rather than the real world. The hybrid powertrain consists of a mid-mounted Lambda 11 V6 engine and a Yasa E electric motor. The V6 alone roars to life with 870 hp (649 kW / 882 PS) and 790 lb-ft (1071 Nm) of torque revving up to 10000 rpm while the quiet electric motor adds an extra 201 hp (150 kW / 204 PS) and 196 lb-ft (266 Nm).

With a combined output of a hypercar-worthy 1071 hp (799 kW / 1086 PS) and 986 lb-ft (1337 Nm) of peak torque the Genesis X Gran Berlinetta VGT ventures closer to Bugatti Bolide territory than any other Korean model from the past.

“Our goal was to create a timeless design rooted in the essence of motorsport” said John Krsteski Senior Chief Designer at Genesis. “We have an incredibly diverse global design team that are car and racing enthusiasts. The designers relished the opportunity to create a race car that featured Genesis design elements as well as technical performance attributes. It has become a catalyst of inspiration for our other programs.”

The concept certainly doesn’t look like it could evolve into a production offering but the designer’s sentiments leave us hopeful that future Genesis products could capture some of its allure and exotic charm. After all most of us would like to see the Hyundai Group’s premium brand trying its luck in more exciting segments. Until that day arrives Gran Turismo 7 players can look forward to taking the Genesis X Gran Berlinetta Vision GT Concept for a virtual spin on their screens beginning in January 2024.

If negotiations this month don’t find agreement that has been elusive so far Louisville-based Baptist Health will no longer be in the Medicare Advantage networks of UnitedHealthcare and WellCare. It has been out of network with Louisville-based Humana for two months.

“In-network rates for medical care are generally more affordable than out-of-network rates” explains Morgan Watkins of Louisville Public Media. Patients pay less out of pocket for services from an in-network provider.

Baptist Health “has cited concerns about various Medicare Advantage plans routinely denying or delaying approvals of or payments for medical services recommended by patients’ doctors” Watkins reports. “The health system said it has been trying to negotiate new contracts with several insurers.”

When that didn’t work with Humana Baptist Health and its clinicians left the insurer’s network in September. Starting Jan. 1 it will no longer be in the UnitedHealthcare and WellCare networks unless negotiations forge an agreement. Baptist has alerted its patients.

Baptist spokesperson Kit Fullenlove Barry told Watkins “It remains our top priority to secure agreements with Medicare Advantage plans that protect our patients’ access to the medical care they need and allow medical care decisions to be made by the patient and their doctor not an insurance company.”

UnitedHealthcare the nation’s largest health insurer told Watkins it still hopes to reach an agreement with Baptist Kentucky’s largest hosptal chain: “Our top priority is to renew our relationship with Baptist Health and ensure continued access to the health system for people enrolled in our Medicare Advantage plans. We are committed to continued good-faith negotiation and using the remaining time on our contract to reach a new agreement.” Wellcare did not comment.

A person with an HMO plan could face “significantly higher” out-of-pocket costs starting next year Baptist said in a letter to patients. But if a patient applies for “continuity of care” benefits for patients who are pregnant or receiving chemotherapy or dialysis the Medicare Advantage plan would have to temporarily cover their care at Baptist with in-network rates.

Advantage plans have lower costs but with limits on befefits and providers. Original Medicare has no such limits. Also Watkins notes “A 2022 federal inspector general report said audits “have highlighted widespread and persistent problems related to inappropriate denials of services and payment” by Advantage plans.

Open enrollment for Medicare Advantage plans runs through Thursday Dec. 7. It will resume Jan. 1 and end March 31; for switching Advantage plans or going to original Medicare.

Help with Medicare is available at Medicare.gov 1-800-MEDICARE and the Kentucky State Health Insurance Plan office.

Bowl assignments were announced Sunday and the Quick Lane Bowl selected the Gophers who will play Bowling Green (7-5) at 1 p.m. Dec. 26 at Ford Field.

The Gophers closed the regular season with a four-game losing streak to fall to 5-7 but qualified for a bowl game because there were only 81 six-win teams to fill the 82 bowl slots and their Academic Progress Rate score was the best among five-win teams.

It appeared the Gophers might be headed to the Guaranteed Rate Bowl for the second time in three years because they were the last Big Ten team left for the Phoenix-based bowl to pick. Instead contractual language ended up sending Minnesota to Detroit.

Because the Gophers didn't win six games they weren't technically considered to be bowl eligible by the Big Ten. The Guaranteed Rate Bowl's contract with the Big Ten allows the bowl to pick a Mountain West team to fill its spot if there aren't enough bowl-eligible Big Ten teams. That happened and the Guaranteed Rate Bowl selected UNLV of the Mountain West to face Kansas of the Big 12.

The Guaranteed Rate's situation left the Quick Lane Bowl with the chance to select Minnesota which it did.

The Gophers are 2-0 in the Quick Lane Bowl beating Central Michigan 21-14 in 2015 when they advanced with a 5-7 record based on their APR score and topping Georgia Tech 34-10 in 2018 to finish 7-6.

Bowling Green has won five of its past six games and finished in third place in the Mid-American Conference's East Division. The Gophers and Falcons have split four meetings with Bowling Green winning the last one 14-10 in 2021 at Huntington Bank Stadium when Minnesota was a 31-point favorite.

Another memorable Gophers-Falcons matchup happened in 2007. Tim Brewster making his Gophers coaching debut famously plopped down on the Metrodome turf on his stomach nearly spread eagle while Bowling Green scored a two-point conversion in overtime to beat Minnesota 32-31.

Bowling Green will be in the Quick Lane Bowl for the second consecutive season having lost 24-19 to New Mexico State last year.

This will be the Gophers' fifth bowl trip in seven seasons under coach P.J. Fleck and they have won the previous four. Overall the Gophers have a six-game bowl winning streak and a bowl record of 11-12.

Brad Michaels executive director of the Quick Lane Bowl on Friday said the bowl would love to have the Gophers. He added that the Gophers being in Detroit for the third time in nine years wouldn't be a concern.

""It's been spread out"" Michaels said. ""I sure don't think people wouldn't go to the game because they were here five years ago.""

The Gophers have been a strong attendance draw for the game. The second- and third-highest announced attendance figures for the bowl have occurred when Minnesota has played in it — 34217 in 2015 and 27228 in 2018.

""Minnesota fans travel"" Michaels said.

Jackson announces return

Gophers wide receiver Daniel Jackson who leads the team with 57 catches for 831 yards and eight touchdowns announced on the X platform that he is returning to the team for his senior season in 2024 citing an agreement with Dinkytown Athletes the program's official Name Image and Likeness (NIL) collective.

Roland was born in San Antonio Texas on January 25 1956 to Augustin and Lupe Trevino. Roland graduated from UTSA University of Texas San Antonio with a bachelor in Computer Science and System Design. He worked for IBM Bank of America Texas Instruments AMTrust Huntington Ingalls Industries Carefirst Blue Cross Blue Shield and other corporations as a Computer Enterprise Architect and a Technical Writer along with his early days of coding. Prior to college Roland served in the United States Air Force for four years during which time he worked on F14 fighter jets. It was at this time when Roland first gave his life and heart to Jesus Christ under the military tutelage of an Assembly of God chaplain in the Air Force. Thereafter Roland stayed dedicated to God his entire life. Roland was happily married to Lynn Trevino who was his partner in life for almost 14 years at the time of his passing on to be with his God.

Roland is survived by his wife three children of his own: Joel Paul and Philip six children through marriage: Austin Aaron Breeana Shalise Larell and Warren seven grandchildren his parents two sisters: Olaya and Cindy along with one brother: Richard Trevino.

Roland loved to fish ride his Harley Davidson Dyna Glide attend church teach Bible studies study new code/systems along with playing password and other group games with his family on “monthly family Sundays”. He especially loved talking about mutual technology with his son Aaron and the years they spent doing apologetics together. Roland took immense pride in Joel and Paul who pursued the military and served many years and still serve. Roland had a fascination with small business and Real Estate as a hobby. He constantly asked about each of his children and was always interested in all that they were accomplishing in life; in Christ in their families in the armed forces and in business. Roland was a wonderful father and an honorable human being in every manner. He had the personality of a peacemaker yet he would stand up for what he felt was right. He was an informed studier when it came to culture and politics. He supported conservative values passionately which he viewed as Biblical values close to the heart of God. Roland left a legacy inspired by the Holy Spirit and his family will be forever grateful to him. We will miss Roland beyond words till we meet again in heaven a very real place for those that put Jesus first in their lives and keep Him there.

Family and friends are invited to attend a celebration of life gathering on Saturday December 2nd with viewing from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. followed by Roland’s celebration of life service from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. which will be held at Gentry Morrison Southside Chapel in Lakeland Florida. In lieu of flowers the family requests donations be made to Redemption Church Beaumont Texas https://www.redemptiontx.com/give/  which was Roland’s favorite church for the last two years that he loved and felt so much encouragement from. He loved the pastor and his cultural boldness for God in these end times.

As the US civil rights movement gained traction early in the decade the company would have to confront segregation and its corrosive impact on “respect for the individual.”

For company president Thomas J. Watson Jr. the issue was both business and personal. IBM had long maintained an informal policy of non-discrimination based on race. As the company entered an era of booming growth for its computers it planned to expand with new factories in North Carolina and Kentucky where it would run a racially integrated workforce. In 1953 Watson Jr. expressed personal conviction and decades of company practice when he penned “Policy Letter #4” IBM’s first official equal opportunity policy.

He took a stand. “It is the policy of this organization to hire people who have the personality talent and background necessary to fill a given job regardless of race color or creed” the letter read. It came a year before the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education court decision that integrated public schools and more than a decade before passage of the Civil Rights Act.

Watson was intolerant of managers who fell short of his policies. Once upon hearing of a candidate’s rejection after eight interviews and possible discrimination Watson Jr. exploded. “What are we coming to in IBM? God almighty fellas we live in America — this country was created by people who were persecuted overseas. … How can I stand up and tell people tell chairmen of organizations how wonderful we are with our lack of discrimination and look at the action that you fellas and your associates are taking” he said.

In 1962 the company signed on to President John F. Kennedy’s “Plan for Progress” vowing among other things to strengthen its commitment to equal opportunity without regard to “race creed color sex national origin or age.” IBM had been making that very pledge to its employees for decades. In 1968 the company would put its money where its policies were opening a manufacturing facility that would employ 300 local residents in the under-resourced Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant. The new jobs Watson Jr. hoped would improve the quality of life in these neighborhoods and create opportunities for those who wanted to work elsewhere.

It would continue to build on these initiatives for years to come and has often been one step ahead of the changes moving society.

For example IBM has been on the front lines of adopting protections for the LGBTQ+ community and promoting inclusivity in business. In 1984 it became one of the first companies to add sexual orientation to its global nondiscrimination policy. In 1995 it formed an LGBTQ+ Executive Council. In 1996 it extended healthcare coverage and other benefits to the partners of its gay and lesbian employees making it the largest US company at the time to adopt such a policy. In 2002 it also incorporated gender identity and expression into its nondiscrimination policy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW0uaWVlZS5vcmcvcXVhbnR1bS1lcnJvci1jb3JyZWN0aW9uLWlibdIBRWh0dHBzOi8vc3BlY3RydW0uaWVlZS5vcmcvYW1wL3F1YW50dW0tZXJyb3ItY29ycmVjdGlvbi1pYm0tMjY2NjM4OTg0Mw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IBM Offers Quantum Error Suppression Out Of The Box,Edd Gent is a freelance science and technology writer based in Bengaluru India.

One of the most difficult challenges facing the adoption of LLM is in specifying to the model what a harmful answer is but IBM believes it can help improve the situation for firms everywhere.

Speaking at an event in Zurich Elizabeth Daly STSM Research Manager Interactive AI Group of IBM Research Europe highlighted that the company is looking to develop AI that developers can trust noting “It's easy to measure and quantify clicks it's not so easy to measure and quantify what is harmful content.”

Detect Control Audit

Generic governance policies are not enough to control LLMs therefore IBM is looking to develop LLMS to use the law corporate standards and the internal governance of each individual enterprise as a control mechanism - allowing governance to go beyond corporate standards and incorporate the individual ethics and social norms of the country region or industry it is used in.

These documents can provide context to a LLM and can be used to ‘reward’ an LLM for remaining relevant to its current task. This allows an innovative level of fine tuning in determining when AI is outputting harmful content that may violate the social norms of a region and can even allow an AI to detect if it’s own outputs could be identified as harmful.

Moreover IBM has been meticulous in developing its LLMs on data that is trustworthy and detects controls and audits for potential biases at each level and has implemented detection mechanisms at each stage of the pipeline. This is in stark contrast to off-the-shelf foundation models which are typically trained on biassed data and even if this data is later removed the biases can still resurface.

The proposed EU AI Act will link the governance of AI with the intentions of its users and IBM states that usage is a fundamental part of how it will govern its model as some users may use it’s AI for summarization tasks and others may use it for classification tasks. Daly states that usage is therefore a “first class citizen” in IBM’s model of governance.

Tomorrow IBM will announce an advance in an entirely new kind of computing--one that may solve problems in minutes that would take today's supercomputers millions of years. That's the difference in quantum computing a technology being developed at IBM Google and others. It's named for quantum physics which describes the forces of the subatomic realm. The science is deep and we can't scratch the surface but we hope to explain enough so that you won't be blindsided by a breakthrough that could transform civilization.

The quantum computer pushes the limits of knowledge--new science new engineering-- all leading to this processor that computes with the atomic forces that created the universe.

Dario Gil: I think this moment it feels to us like the pioneers of the 1940s and 50s that were building the first digital computers.

Dario Gil is something of a quantum crusader. Spanish-born with a Ph.D. in electrical engineering Gil is head of research at IBM.

Scott Pelley: How much faster is this than say the world's best supercomputer today?

Dario Gil: We are now in a stage where we can do certain calculations with these systems that would take the biggest supercomputers in the world to be able to do some similar calculation. But the beauty of it is that we see that we're gonna continue to expand that capability such that not even a million or a billion of those supercomputers connected together could do the calculations of these future machines. So we've come a long way. And the most exciting part is that we have a road map and a journey right now where that is going to continue to increase at a rate that is gonna be shocking.

IBM Director of Research Dario Gil 60 Minutes

Scott Pelley: I'm not sure the world is prepared for this change.

Dario Gil: Definitely not.

To understand the change go back to 1947 and the invention of a switch called a transistor.

Computers have processed information on transistors ever since getting faster as more transistors were squeezed onto a chip--billions of them today.

But it takes that many because each transistor holds information in only two states. It's either on or it's off-- like a coin-- heads or tails. Quantum abandons transistors and encodes information on electrons that behave like this coin we created with animation. Electrons behave in a way so that they are heads and tails and everything in between. You've gone from handling one bit of information at a time on a transistor to exponentially more data.

Michio Kaku: You can see that there's a fantastic amount of information stored when you can look at all possible angles not just up or down.

Physicist Michio Kaku of the City University of New York already calls today's computers ""classical."" He uses a maze to explain quantum's difference.

Michio Kaku: Let's look at a classical computer calculating how a mouse navigates a maze. It is painful. One by one it has to map every single left turn right turn left turn right turn before it finds the goal. Now a quantum computer scans all possible routes simultaneously. This is amazing. How many turns are there? Hundreds of possible turns right? Quantum computers do it all at once.

Kaku's book titled ""Quantum Supremacy"" explains the stakes.

Michio Kaku: We're looking at a race a race between China between IBM Google Microsoft Honeywell all the big boys are in this race to create a workable operationally efficient quantum computer. Because the nation or company that does this will rule the world economy.

Physicist Michio Kaku 60 Minutes

But a reliable general purpose quantum computer is a tough climb yet. Maybe that's why this wall is in the lobby of Google's quantum lab in California.

Here we got an inside look starting with a microscope's view of what replaces the transistor.

Google employee: This right here is one qubit and this is another qubit this is a five qubit chain.

Those crosses at the bottom are qubits short for quantum bits. They hold the electrons and act like artificial atoms. Unlike transistors each additional qubit doubles the computer's power. It's exponential. so while 20 transistors are 20 times more powerful than one. Twenty qubits are a million times more powerful than one.

Charina Chou: So this gets positioned right here on the fridge.

Charina Chou chief operating officer of Google's lab showed us the processor that holds the qubits. Much of that above chills the qubits to what physicists call near absolute zero.

Scott Pelley: Near absolute zero I understand is about 460 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. So that's about as cold as anything can get.

Charina Chou: Yes almost as cold as possible.

That temperature inside a sealed computer is one of the coldest places in the universe. The deep freeze eliminates electrical resistance and isolates the qubits from outside vibrations so they can be controlled with an electro-magnetic field. The qubits must vibrate in unison. But that's a tough trick called coherence.

Scott Pelley: Once you have achieved coherence of the qubits how easy is that to maintain?

Charina Chou: It's really hard. Coherence is very challenging.

Coherence is fleeting. In all similar machines coherence breaks down constantly--creating errors.

Charina Chou: We're making about one error in every hundred or so steps. Ultimately we think we're gonna need about one error in every million or so steps. That would probably be identified as one of the biggest barriers.

Charina Chou chief operating officer at Google Quantum AI and Scott Pelley 60 Minutes

Mitigating those errors and extending coherence time while scaling up to larger machines are the challenges facing German-American scientist Hartmut Neven who founded Google's lab and its casual style in 2012.

Scott Pelley: Can the problems that are in the way of quantum computing be solved?

Hartmut Neven: I should confess my subtitle here is chief optimist. After having said this I would say at this point we don't need any more fundamental breakthroughs. We need little improvements here and there. If we have all the pieces together we just need to integrate them well to build larger and larger systems.

Scott Pelley: And you think that all of this will be integrated into a system in what period of time?

Hartmut Neven: Yeah. We often say we wanna do it by the end of the decade so that we can use this Kennedy quote ""Get it done by the end of the decade.""

Scott Pelley: The end of this decade?

Hartmut Neven: Yes.

Scott Pelley: Five or six years?

Hartmut Neven: Yes.

That's about the timeline Dario Dil predicts. And the IBM research director told us something surprising.

Scott Pelley: There are problems that classical computers can never solve.

Dario Gil: Can never solve. And I think this is an important point because we're accustomed to say ""ah computers get better."" Actually there are many many problems that are so complex that we can make that statement that ""Actually classical computers will never be able to solve that problem."" Not now not 100 years from now not 1000 years from now."" You actually require a different way to represent information and process information. That's what quantum gives you.

Quantum could give us answers to impossible problems in physics chemistry engineering and medicine. Which is why IBM and Cleveland Clinic have installed one of the first quantum computers to leave the lab for the real world.

Serpil Erzurum: It takes way too much time to find the solutions we need.

Dr. Serpil Erzurum chief research officer at Cleveland Clinic 60 Minutes

We sat down with Dario Gil and Dr. Serpil Erzurum chief research officer at Cleveland Clinic. She told us health care would be transformed if quantum computers can model the behavior of proteins- the molecules that regulate all life. Proteins change shape to change function in ways too complex to follow. and when they get it wrong that causes disease.

Serpil Erzurum: It takes on many shapes many many shapes depending upon what it's doing and where it is and which other protein it's with. I need to understand the shape it's in when it's doing an interaction or a function that I don't want it to do for that patient. Cancer autoimmunity. It's a problem. We are limited completely by the computational ability to look at the structure in real time for any even one molecule.

Cleveland Clinic is so proud of its quantum computer they set it up in a lobby. Behind the glass that shiny silver cylinder encloses the kind of cooling system and processor you saw earlier. Quantum is not solving the protein problem yet. This is more of a trial run to introduce researchers to quantum's potential.

Scott Pelley: The people using this machine are they having to learn an entirely different way to communicate with a computer?

Dario Gil: I think that's what's really nice that you actually just use a regular laptop and you write a program very much like you would write a traditional program. But when you you know click you know ""go"" and ""run"" it just happens to run on a very different kind of computer.

There are a half dozen competing designs in the race. China named quantum a top national priority and the U.S. government is spending nearly a billion dollars a year on research. The first change comes next year when the U.S. publishes new standards for encryption because quantum is expected one day to break the codes that lock everything from national secrets to credit cards. Tomorrow IBM will unveil its Quantum System Two with three times the qubits as the machine you saw in Cleveland. This past August we saw System Two under construction.

Dario Gil: It's a machine unlike anything we have ever built.

Scott Pelley: And this is it.

Dario Gil: And this is it.

IBM's Dario Gil told us System Two has the room to expand to thousands of qubits.

Scott Pelley: What are the chances that this is one of those things that's gonna be ready in five years and always will be?

Dario Gil: We don't see an obstacle right now that would prevent us from building systems that will have tens of thousands and even a 100 thousand qubits working with each other. So we are highly confident that we will get there.

Of all the amazing things we heard it was physicist Michio Kaku who led us down the path to the biggest idea of all. He said we were walking through a quantum computer. Processing information with subatomic particles is how the universe works.

Michio Kaku: You know when I look at the night sky I see stars I look at the flowers the trees I realize that it's all quantum the splendor of the universe itself. The language of the universe is the language of the quantum.

Learning that language may bring more than inconceivable speed. Reverse engineering nature's computer could be a window on creation itself.

(NASDAQ:ILMN) Potentially Undervalued?,"Illumina Inc. ( ) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Illumina’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.

Is Illumina Still Cheap?

The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 19% below my intrinsic value which means if you buy Illumina today you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $136.35 then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Illumina’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market providing a prime buying opportunity.

Can we expect growth from Illumina?

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 67% over the next year the near-term future seems bright for Illumina. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock which should feed into a higher share valuation.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? ILMN’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price with shares trading around its fair value. However there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ILMN now may not be the most optimal time to buy given it is trading around its fair value. However the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

Il centro di Bari si illumina per le feste: tra alberi e angeli giganti via Sparano sotto un tetto di luci

Primo assaggio del Natale con l'accensione delle luminarie nelle principali strade del centro di Bari. In via Sparano due angeli di luce a dare il benvenuto a chi arriva da corso Vittorio Emanuele e poi tutta la strada dello shopping è percorsa da un tetto di luci realizzato da Paulicelli. All'altezza della chiesa di san Ferdinando un albero gigantesco con artistici rami (offerto da Acmei).

Chip giant Intel (INTC 0.84%) is investing billions of dollars in building its own foundry business. The real payoff won't come until 2025 at the earliest when its Intel 18A process node expected by Intel to be the best in the industry enters full-scale production. In addition to the Intel 18A process the company's foundry arm advertises the cost-effective Intel 16 process for chips that don't need cutting-edge manufacturing tech as well as the upcoming Intel 3 process.

Intel Foundry doesn't appear to offer the Intel 4 process as an option. Intel 4 will be used to manufacture the company's own Meteor Lake laptop chips which are set to launch in December but nothing else on Intel's PC or server roadmaps make use of the process.

It turns out that at least one other product is using Intel 4. Swedish telecommunications company Ericsson announced in November that its latest family of radio-access network chips which are used by communications-service providers are manufactured using the Intel 4 process. It's unclear whether this was a true design win for Intel Foundry given that Intel 4 doesn't seem to be on the menu or if Intel was involved in the design process. Either way it's a win for Intel's manufacturing ambitions.

Just the beginning

While the news that Ericsson was using the Intel 4 process for its RAN chips was a surprise the two companies struck a deal earlier this year to manufacture future Ericsson chips using the Intel 18A process. Under the agreement Intel will manufacture future 5G SoCs for Ericsson using the Intel 18A process and the two companies will collaborate to optimize Intel's latest Xeon server central processing units (CPUs) for Ericsson's Cloud RAN solutions.

The Intel 4 process which the company used to refer to as its 7nm process will be the first from Intel that uses extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography a technology capable of printing much smaller patterns than previous lithography technologies. Intel 3 will be a refined version of Intel 4 bringing improvements in power efficiency.

The Intel 20A and Intel 18A processes introduce additional innovations. Both processes will feature backside-power delivery which moves the wires that deliver power to the chip below the transistor layer. This approach promises to boost performance on top of the performance gain delivered by shrinking the size of the transistors. Intel will be the first manufacturer to use backside-power delivery when the Intel 20A process is ready in 2024. These two processes will also use a new transistor design called RibbonFET.

Assuming Intel can maintain its roadmap and launch these processes on time the company will be in a great position in 2025 to compete for business from leading chip designers. Ericsson is already on board for the Intel 18A process; Intel and Arm are collaborating to optimize Intel 18A for future Arm-based chips; and Intel has announced three unnamed customers for Intel 18A including one that made a large prepayment.

The Ericsson chips manufactured on Intel 4 may not move the needle for Intel's foundry business but they do represent a vote of confidence in the company's ability to deliver process nodes on time for its customers. The real test will be in 2025 and beyond when Intel 18A and future process technologies go toe-to-toe with foundry market leader TSMC.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHA6Ly9nYW1lcnNuZXh1cy5uZXQvY3B1cy9iZXN0LWNwdXMtMjAyMy1pbnRlbC12cy1hbWQtZ2FtaW5nLXZpZGVvLWVkaXRpbmctYnVkZ2V0LWJpZ2dlc3QtZGlzYXBwb2ludG1lbnTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Best CPUs of 2023 (Intel vs. AMD): Gaming Video Editing Budget & Biggest Disappointment | GamersNexus,"Overview: Best CPUs for 2023

Setting Expectations

Welcome back to our “Best of” roundup series. We do these at the end of every year and there's a lot to catch up on. To set the expectation for this particular piece and all the other “Best ofs” you'll see coming up this is intended to get people up to speed as quickly as possible.

We have run thousands of tests over the past year. Actually if you count the individual test passes we're in the many tens of thousands at this point. We've looked at dozens of parts and it's hard for us to keep track of – we have to constantly reference the data. The purpose of these pieces is to both refresh ourselves on the data and to get everybody who's been out of the market for a couple of years back up to speed quickly – or even if you followed it closely just a reminder.

Best Overall CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D

Original review | Newegg | Amazon

The first award category is for Best Overall CPU of 2023. This one goes handily to the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU which has had price reductions down to around $360. This CPU is a double-winner also taking our Best Gaming CPU category later -- so for Best Overall we’ll focus mostly on the non-gaming aspects of the 7800X3D.

The 7800X3D is priced right around where high-end gaming CPUs long held pricing in the pre-i9 and R9 days bringing chart-leading framerate back to a more normal price-point for a high-end machine. They’re also single CCD solutions with only one size of core. This makes scheduling easier and simplifies setup as opposed to something like a dual-CCD 7950X3D or in Intel’s case a P-core/E-core design. The 7800X3D isn’t a leader in production benchmarks like Blender but it’s more than acceptable while still leading in gaming. There’s a balanced category for CPUs that sit in the middle better. It does do excellently in Photoshop though so the X3D CPUs can punch up depending on workload.

Another non-gaming contributing factor is the efficiency: The 7800X3D is an extremely efficient part and ranked behind the new Threadripper parts that blew the doors open in this category. Because of the efficiency it’s relatively easy to tame thermally: You don’t need a 360mm CLC to cool the 7800X3D reducing cost barrier to entry and opening up cooler options.

The 7800X3D particularly stands-out for anyone trying to max-out the framerate in gaming with a 7900 XTX or RTX 4090 where you want to minimize bottlenecks as much as possible. We’ll come back to that in the gaming category.

Most Balanced CPU: Intel Core i5-14600K & Core i5-13600K

Original Review | Amazon (13600K) | Newegg (13600K)

The next category is for the Most Balanced CPU -- we've had this category for several years now though skipped last year due to having other options. This one goes to the i5 K-SKU CPUs: The 13600K or 14600K depending on whichever is cheaper because they’re basically the same.

The Most Balanced category is specifically a weighting of all tests we run for GN reviews but also considering price. This means we’re factoring-in the $270 price of a 13600K right now for example which makes it extremely competitive from a pricing standpoint. Even though the name is a generation old the CPU isn’t -- it’s perfectly good as a new chip that is balanced between price gaming performance and production performance.

As an example we found the 14600K scored 747 points in our aggregate Adobe Premiere benchmarks putting it ahead of the 7800X3D and about tied with the 7700X. The CPU was likewise particularly competitive in our Blender rendering benchmark where the pair completed in less time than the 7700X and 7800X3D. The 13700K and 14700K also do well here with an overall strong balance across all tested applications despite not being the “best” in any of them but the 13700K and 14700K didn’t win this category due to the high power consumption and price.

The gaming performance is also strong for the price with our pre-patch Starfield numbers -- which were run with all of these on the same version -- at 111-112FPS AVG for the i5 CPUs. That’s behind the 7800X3D but with the higher production workload performance in many cases and the lower price it’s balanced.

Baldur’s Gate 3 performance is also good putting the i5 CPUs alongside the powerful 5800X3D. The 5800X3D got a different award but doesn’t get our balanced award primarily due to weaker production performance.

While the i5 K-SKUs are not the best in any single category they fulfill an overall well-rounded performance and value profile.

Best Gaming CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D

Next up is the award for Best Gaming CPU. This one goes to the AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D. The category is as basic as it can be: This considers only the absolute highest-performing CPU in games we’ve tested. That means we’re looking at CPUs for FPS snobs. While there are other options that’ll get you 80% of the performance those aren’t considered here. That makes this one heavily numbers-based.

First the basics for anyone who’s been out of the market: The R7 7800X3D is a socket AM5 CPU that uses AMD’s stackable cache or V-cache which we’ve found to have a large impact on gaming performance. It’s an 8C/16T part with 96MB of L3 cache that is currently around $360 at the time of filming with occasional small discounts on Newegg and Amazon. This one has been hovering at this price for a while now down from its $450 launch MSRP.

Because this is a purely numbers-based category let’s look at some recent gaming benchmark charts:

In the new Cyberpunk: Phantom Liberty expansion that probably a lot of you will be playing during the holidays the 7800X3D led the charts. It was about tied with the 7950X3D although it carried better 0.1% lows. We have run the 7950X3D through this game several times and found that it always encounters a couple sluggish frametimes run-to-run despite an overall good average which we think just has to do with scheduling. Either way though the 7800X3D is meaningfully ahead of everything here and isn’t even the most expensive gaming CPU on the chart. The 5800X3D would get you most of the way there as an upgrade but Intel’s 14900K leaves a large gap to the 7800X3D.

In Stellaris turn time simulation the 7800X3D was roughly tied with the rest of the chart leaders. It’s up there with the 14700K 14900K and 7950X3D which are all roughly within error of each other.

Baldur’s Gate 3 had the 7950X3D ahead on a technicality but it was ultimately very close to margin of error. The 7800X3D and 7950X3D both establish a relatively wide gap between themselves and the next CPU the 14900K. “Relatively” is the important word: It’s not meaningful but if you glance at the rest of the chart you’ll notice much more gradual scaling of the average bar down the chart. If you were to look at the 1440p chart you’ll see that the 7800X3D is still at the top and retains all of its performance despite an increase in GPU load.

Finally we’ll show Starfield as a counter-example. This was before the most recent patches so new numbers will be a little higher but all of these were run on the same game version and so are directly comparable to each other. Intel kept a lead here with the 14900K ahead of the 7800X3D by 15%. It’s not always the best but it’s the best often enough that it’s our go-to for a high-end gaming machine.

The 7800X3D is the overall best gaming CPU. There are places where the cache doesn’t get leveraged as heavily but the places it’s beneficial outweigh the areas we saw diminishing returns. Although the extra cache doesn’t benefit this CPU in most of our production workloads the core count allows it to remain a good overall option. If you’re editing videos or running file compression and decompression workloads the CPU does perfectly fine. This will most likely bottleneck you on the GPU so to fully leverage this CPU consider a higher end GPU. We’d be looking in the RTX 4070 Ti or RX 7900 XT and up categories especially although you could obviously pair anything with it. We recently revisited the RX 7900 XT right here on the website if you want to see how that is today.

Best Upgrade Value CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D

Original Review | Amazon | Newegg

Next up is for the best upgrade. We added this category last year. We’re defining this as the best CPU that can drop-in to a board of a past generation either Intel or AMD. It’s probably no surprise that the winner is the R7 5800X3D and we hope that this encourages both AMD and Intel to keep offering good upgrade options in the future -- it’s great for consumers and often highly cost effective for a stricter budget.

Our recent Ryzen 2000 revisit showed just how much room there still is to bring AM4 forward especially in gaming. The best part is that a lot of boards from the prior Ryzen generations can support the X3D CPU already (just check the CPU support list and update BIOS before pulling your old CPU). Many of the boards that support the R7 2700 R5 3600 and obviously the 5000-series CPUs will run the 5800X3D without issues and even some of the older R7 1700-era boards on X370-era chipsets can work (though it’s more spotty).





If we look at a couple of gaming charts from our 2700X revisit you can see how you’ll get a performance bump from those older CPUs that feels like a totally new PC build (especially if coupling it with a drop-in GPU upgrade so you can save on RAM the motherboard and the case).

The 5800X3D is also relatively low power consumption for its performance. In an all-core workload we had it at around 108W. That makes it easy to cool for a good $30-$50 dual-tower air cooler something like the Peerless Assassin that we reviewed.

It’s almost good enough for a modern build too but the board cost starts affecting value for a new system although options on eBay may open things up. Ultimately the 5800X3D makes a ton of sense as a cost-saving high-performance upgrade where you can allocate what would be spent on all new components instead toward the CPU and GPU alone. That AMD has kept the platform alive this long is commendable and we hope to see this going forward. The environmental impact and e-waste impact is far lower and the value for existing owners of the platform is strong.

Most Efficient CPU: AMD Threadripper 7980X & Ryzen 7 7800X3D

Original Review | Amazon (7980X) | Newegg (7980X)

The next award is for the most efficient CPU. On a technicality of actual power efficiency based on our testing that goes to the Threadripper 7980X 64-core CPU. At $5000 this CPU costs more than a full gaming PC for a lot of people likely referencing this list so we’ll name its runner-up as well: The R7 7800X3D with an honorable mention to the R9 7950X in Eco Mode.

The 7980X leads by a lot though: In workstation applications that scale cleanly on 64 cores the amount of time required to complete a given unit of work by the 7980X is impressive.

In our efficiency chart the 7980X posted a 12.9 watt-hour result with the 7800X3D previously being the most impressive modern CPU outside of utilizing Eco Mode (although the 5950X remains a leader for its era). That’s what earns the 7800X3D the runner-up status but the 7980X is even more interesting.

As we talked about in our review its power utilization per core is exceptionally low due to a 0.84-0.85v Vcore during all-core operation when capped with a 350W PPT. These results plus the multithreaded efficacy in all-core applications earn it the most efficient award with the 7800X3D being one of the most effective in framerate per Watt efficiency in a lot of games.

Intel is currently way behind in all-core efficiency for desktop-class parts with its 300W flagships propping-up the high-end CPU cooler market well.

Best Budget CPUs: Ryzen 7600 & Ryzen 5700X

The next award goes to the best budget CPU where we normally target around the $150 to $200 price range. This one was hard: There aren’t many current generation options under $200. There’s the R5 7600 non-X at right around $200 then the last-gen R7 5700X makes a ton of sense for its current $170 price on Newegg Intel has its i5-12600K (or KF) for 'cheap' now too and there’s also an R5 7500F that isn’t officially out in the West. The R5 5600 was also in our consideration here for its reduced modern pricing. This makes choosing difficult: There are a lot of good last-gen options but not many under $200 from newer lineups.

We’ll do this two ways: If you’re one of the many people on AM4 the R7 5700X might be one of your best budget-friendly options to get a final upgrade. It has nearly identical performance to the 5800X in gaming from the tests we ran in our original 5700X review but tends to be cheaper. It’s not as big of a jump as the 5800X3D but where price is a hard limiter it could be a worthwhile midstep. The 5600 makes less sense as an upgrade just because you’d have to be upgrading from pretty low and far back on the Ryzen stack while also being budget-constrained. We’ll give the best budget CPU to the 5700X if you’re keeping an old platform.

As for something new the R5 7600 really is worth considering: The Ryzen 7000 series launched with high pricing that reduced some of the appeal against prior generations. The 7600 is now around $200 and is often within striking distance of the 7600X. If you’re able to find a 7600X at the same price you might as well get that instead as it is a bit faster -- although TDP is lower on the 7600.

Best High-End Desktop CPU: Threadripper 7970X

Original Review | Amazon | Newegg

The next category is for the best high-end desktop CPU. For this we don’t mean the literal “best” but instead what we think would provide a strong foundation for something like a video editing machine CPU-based rendering machine or something dealing with Chromium-like compiles.

We’re naming the Threadripper 7970X here and the only reason we added this CPU is because we’re very likely going to switch to the 7970X for our own editing stations.





Click to enlarge the charts.

The 7980X isn’t viable for us but the 7970X posted excellent Adobe Premiere results in the Puget Bench while also posting particularly strong RAW video benchmark results and intraframe benchmark results. In that sense this is a selfish pick: We’re planning to build a 7970X machine for the office because based on our hands-on experience with it we think it’d really help accelerate some of our video editing and rendering experience.

Best CPU Under $100: i3-12100F

Original Review (13100F recent tests) | Amazon | Newegg

This one isn’t just for a budget CPU but for the cheapest CPU that can still manage to play at least some games. We’re back with an award that’s getting increasingly difficult to assign each year: The best CPU under $100 which goes to the Intel i3-12100F right now.

We checked and right now the brand new CPU options under $100 are slim: There’s i3-13100F at $110 to $120 which is problematic both because it’s not below $100 but also because there are better options not distant from $120. The R5 4600G is also around but not competitive with the 12100F in its intended use case with a dGPU. There’s also the R5 5500 but last time we reran that through the suite at the request of viewers we found its value was worse than the 12100F. The 12100F was also just a better performer with boosts anywhere from about 5% AVG FPS to 31% in games or 2% to 35% in 1% lows.

We had a lot of reservations about FPS/dollar charts for reasons we explained in our 13100 review but it does help illustrate a point here: Using the pricing of the time that had the 12100F as one of the best value CPUs available. Higher was better here.

In an absolute sense the i3-12100F is more than capable of playing a lot of games: The performance in F1 2022 from our test at the time had it at 270FPS AVG. It’ll struggle in some games -- like Cities: Skylines 2 assuming you’re not just completely bound-up on the GPU or maybe Starfield with the same caveat -- but overall for builds where you can’t spend more money this is a good starter option when financials are the bottleneck. It really helps to give some perspective on how good a cheap CPU can be just for the basics. And this really is an important category for PC parts: Every year we have people comment about “if you just spend another $40” but for a lot of people $40 more is not a “just” it’s a make-or-break on the build. Everyone has a price limit on their hobbies and keeping that range as tunable as possible is good. Have no illusions: The 12100F will struggle in some games and it won’t age as well but it does fall in the “good enough” category for a lot of games and it does come in under $100. That also helps keep board costs down.

Biggest Disappointment: Intel 14th Generation

The last category is a classic of ours: It’s for the biggest disappointment.

This year that award goes to the entire 14th “Generation” -- and that’s the first clue. It’s not a generational iteration but is instead a numerical one. Which is fine except there wasn’t any meaningful uplift. The 14th series didn’t do anything to advance performance in a meaningful way but at least briefly reset the prices. Now the 13 and 14 series CPUs have shuffled around a little bit in price. We’re completely OK with product refreshes but they need to be more clearly branded as such and should at least post some kind of uplift. The 14 series just didn’t do that and the temporarily high pricing was likewise unfortunate -- although they did seem to reset.

Closing Thoughts

The pricing we mentioned is from just before Black Friday is actually happening. Depending on how much things change you're going to see some numbers move around. If things drop in price then that may affect how much we value a processor versus something else of course.

Based on the numbers we've given you from our data and the prices we have today the decisions for the most part are pretty clear: The best gaming CPU is the 7800X3D (that's an objective fact) the most efficient part is the 7980X the 5800X3D is the best upgrade path and Intel makes the strongest showing in the i5-13600K or 14600K (whichever is cheaper) for a balanced build or the 12100F for an ultra-budget build.

There are a couple of categories where it's less clear like Best Budget. It's really not as straightforward as it used to be for us. It used to be as simple as saying “R5 2600 200 bucks yep that's definitely the winner no questions about it” assuming it didn't win best overall or something for that year. Now though it's difficult because some of the best CPUs are a prior generation which feels a little weird to recommend now since they're EOL platforms. There's a lot of value in buying into a new platform if the companies (AMD specifically) do anything like AMD did with AM4. That's the one category where it was kind of difficult to nail down a single CPU so we gave you the two options.

That covers it for the best CPUs of 2023. Again you can find the full reviews on the site or the channel and those will give you complete depth. This piece hopefully got you up to speed quickly so you can use it as a launching point to go do your next bit of research on the CPUs we've hopefully pointed you in the direction of. We have other roundups coming up so check back regularly for those.

Just a quick note too these are really fun to work on because we lose sight of just how many products ship in the computer hardware market over the course of a year. There's a lot that aren't that interesting but compiling the most interesting ones (plus one in this case group of disappointing ones) into a single piece is a lot of fun. It gets us back up to speed – there's so much going on it's hard to stay on top of it all the time. Hopefully this helped you as well!

That's all at the expense of Nvidia and Intel which saw equally significant losses. However this is more of a return to the status quo than AMD suddenly posting substantial gains. October's Steam hardware survey shows a similar boost in Nvidia GPU and Intel CPU usage which has now been undone. This isn't the only quirk of November's survey result either.

Nvidia's spike in usage was brief

The November survey is practically the reverse of the October survey; almost everything gained in October declined in November and vice versa. The brief surge of GeForce RTX 30-series cards in GPUs suddenly turned into a retreat. Cards like the RTX 3060 Ti RTX 3070 and RTX 3070 Ti saw their shares decline by double digits and the RTX 3060 in particular got hammered as it went from 9.92% to 5.04% share. Meanwhile almost every AMD card from the last three generations went up.

However all of this is more or less in line with the results from September implying that October's results were the outlier. The odds of Nvidia making and then losing such a large share in a few months seem pretty unlikely.

CPU trends from October were also short-lived

October's survey saw significant gains for Intel but in November that's been completely reversed much like Nvidia's GPU gains. AMD controls roughly a third of the market while Intel has the other two-thirds. Additionally usage of 6-core CPUs declined as quad-cores rose but that only brings things back to September levels just like with different trends.

But beyond AMD and Intel there are also other quirks too. The share of 4-core and 6-core CPUs is back to September's figures with quad cores going back up and hexa cores going back down. These numbers also changed slightly so it's not just noise.

Support for the AX512VNNI instruction is also interesting as it's only supported by Intel's 11th to 14th Gen Raptor Lake Refresh CPUs and AMD's Ryzen 7000 series. It indicates roughly 10% of Steam users own one of these CPUs and it also saw a strange fluctuation. The usage of 16GB of RAM the most popular amount for some time also saw a slight dip in October that has now mostly gone away.

Other reversals: Windows 11 vs 10 English vs Chinese

One of the final trends of note is the rapid gain of Windows 11 at Windows 10's expense. Windows 11's share increased by 11.5% nearly as much as Windows 10 lost 12.1%. This offsets what happened in October which saw Windows 11 lose 6.9% share while Windows 10 gained 7.6%. Windows 11 is now at 42% share to Windows 10's 53.5%.

Another significant shift happened in language usage. In October Chinese overtook English with a 13.7% surge in usage putting it at 45.9%. But now English is back on top again with Chinese further away than in September.

This data in particular might tie up all the strangeness surrounding the latest Steam hardware surveys. In 2018 Valve announced that it had identified a flaw with the study that allowed PCs from Asian cyber cafes to complete the survey multiple times. Surveys from before the fix saw AMD CPUs declining in market share despite the latest Ryzen CPUs being far better than their FX series predecessors. Windows 7 which had been superseded by Windows 10 was also overrepresented.

It's probable that Valve never entirely fixed this issue as the March survey shows many of the same trends that October's did. In March AMD's share in CPUs and GPUs decreased significantly while Windows 10 and Chinese made significant gains. All those trends disappeared in the following April survey and things returned to February levels.

Incidents like these make the Steam hardware survey challenging to rely on. Between these reporting issues and missing statistics for CPU names device names and other details it's unclear how proper the survey is.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kaXNwYXRjaC5jb20vc3RvcnkvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWFudWZhY3R1cmluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAzL29oaW8tbGVhZGVycy1pbnRlbC1mb3JtLWNvbnNvcnRpdW0tZm9yLWNoaXBzLWFjdC1iaWxsaW9ucy83MTcxNjYzOTAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ohio leaders Intel form consortium for CHIPS Act billions,"No commitment required.

“Lowlands is a shining example of how South Carolina does conservation so well” commented Dale Threatt-Taylor TNC's executive director in South Carolina. “The family gets to keep ownership of their land while our business and conservation communities and the state invest in protecting its natural resources. Those resources—including clean drinking water—benefit us all.”

The Hampton County property known as Lowlands remains family-owned and will continue to be managed for forestry wildlife and recreational uses on the uplands. A permanent buffer of bottomland hardwoods along more than two miles of Long Branch Creek has been set aside and will never be harvested to ensure water quality in the Savannah River.

“The Lowlands conservation easement is part of a visionary watershed protection effort in the South Lowcountry. Simply stated it’s much less expensive to take proactive natural measures to maintain good water quality than it is to treat unclean water” commented Dr. David Bishop coastal and midlands conservation director. “The protection of this property contributes to a complex of nearly 130000 acres of protected land along the Savannah River made possible in part by the Savannah River Clean Water Fund. This is the fourth easement the Elliott family has done with TNC in recent years which is a remarkable commitment to conservation in South Carolina.”

The Savannah River Clean Water Fund established in 2014 brings together landowners five water utilities and industry from two states to conserve forests for the benefits they provide to drinking water local economies and wildlife. International Paper (IP) was the first private sector company to join the fund and provided a financial contribution to secure this conservation easement.

“Healthy forests are the heart of our stewardship values at International Paper” commented Sophie Beckham vice president and chief sustainability officer at IP. “We are proud of our partnership with TNC in supporting the Savannah River Clean Water Fund which will have a real impact on healthy and productive ecosystems within our communities.”

The South Carolina Conservation Bank has contributed $44682605 to 93 land protection projects in the Savannah River Basin and made a major grant to secure this conservation easement. “Lowlands and the adjoining privately-owned protected properties provide public benefits well beyond their boundaries” remarked Raleigh West director South Carolina Conservation Bank. “The Nature Conservancy’s ability to work at such a significant scale is to the benefit of the residents of Savannah Hilton Head Beaufort and the communities in between.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnByZXNzaGVyYWxkLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEyLzAzL29iaXR1YXJ5ZGF2aWQtYWxiZXJ0LWR5ZXItMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Obituary: David Albert Dyer,"SACO – David Albert Dyer 74 of Saco died unexpectedly Nov. 30 2023 at Maine Medical Center.

Against this backdrop of rising global temperatures and unfulfilled national pledges women girls and gender-diverse people are mobilizing to demand that their voices be heard in decision-making on climate policy.

To answer their demands this paper describes how to achieve feminist climate justice through four interlinked dimensions (recognition redistribution representation and reparation) and the principles of interdependence and intersectionality. It provides practical guidance on what countries need to do to transition to low-emission economies that are resilient to a changing climate while recognizing the leadership of women girls and gender-diverse people in driving the change that is so urgently needed. It zooms in on the global food system as one illustration of how this framework can be applied and provides an analysis of the major barriers to accountability for gender-responsive climate action and how they can be overcome.

The vision for feminist climate justice is of a world in which everyone can enjoy the full range of human rights free from discrimination and flourish on a planet that is healthy and sustainable. With this conceptual framework UN Women aims to open space for discussion of feminist alternatives to the status quo and to inform the next edition of its flagship report “Progress of the world’s women” on gender equality in the age of climate crisis."

Webull Yieldstreet and NomuPay go shopping

Recently on the Equity Podcast Alex Wilhelm and I talked about how M&A activity this year really didn’t happen at the pace we expected. The year started out strong with a string of acquisitions taking place in the space. But then things slowed down considerably.

Well I guess this week I am eating my words as we at TechCrunch reported on three different M&A deals.

First up Webull announced that it had acquired Flink a Mexican stock trading app. I first covered Flink in 2021 when the company raised a $57 million Series B led by Lightspeed Venture Partners.

Flink launched its app in 2018 with a wallet service a digital and physical global debit card backed by Mastercard and in 2020 it began offering the ability to buy and sell fractional shares from 30 pesos without commissions for NYSE-listed stocks. As of August 2021 it had 1.6 million users. It is not known how many it has today.

At that time Lightspeed Partner Mercedes Bent told TechCrunch that her firm “fell in love” with Flink’s mission and impact on the country’s “financial ecosystem.” It was also impressed by the company’s unique features including allowing Mexican investors to access the U.S. stock market and invest fractional shares.

Looks like Lightspeed is not the only entity to have fallen in love with Flink. Anthony Denier head of the Americas and Europe for Webull said the buy marks his company’s expansion into the Latin American market. Notably he added that Webull anticipates using Mexico as a “springboard” into greater Latin and South America where it believes “there is a strong desire among retail investors to access global markets.”

You can hear the Equity podcast crew drill down more on the topic here:

It’s important to note that this isn’t the only big fintech acquisition out of LatAm by a U.S. company this year. In late June credit card giant Visa announced it was acquiring Brazilian payments infrastructure startup Pismo for $1 billion in cash in what is likely one of the largest fintech M&A deals taking place in 2023 so far.

Both Visa and Webull likely had plenty of startup options to consider when deciding to acquire Pismo and Flink respectively. Visa in particular could have picked up a company located anywhere in the world. Both companies chose to acquire a LatAm company and that is not insignificant.

As you can see although funding in the region has dropped I’m still bullish on the region. I believe there is so much opportunity for innovation in the region. The most exciting aspect of fintech to me is the ability to boost inclusion. And it’s doing that and more in LatAm.

As mentioned above Webull acquiring Flink was not the only M&A deal this week.

I also wrote about Yieldstreet’s plans to scoop up Cadre an online marketplace connecting accredited real estate investors with operators. This wasn’t a huge shock as the deal was rumored to be in the works for a few months. But it’s interesting that Cadre — which was co-founded by Joshua and Jared Kushner along with Ryan Williams — was reportedly not doing very well. If true this is just one example of a fintech company taking advantage of market conditions to grow in a specific area without having to reinvent the wheel. More on that deal here.

Over in Europe TC’s Ingrid Lunden reported on Dublin Ireland–based NomuPay — the payments startup that was formed out of some of the healthier pieces of the dramatically failed fintech Wirecard — acquiring Total Processing a startup out of Manchester that builds payment processing solutions for functions like recurring payments risk management PCI (data security) compliance and payment integrations.

NomuPay Ingrid wrote is paying around $35 million for Total Processing and says that the total value of the company is now $135 million. More on that here.

Want to be the next Mint? You may want to rethink that strategy

When Intuit announced it would shut down personal finance app Mint in January it was a chance for competitors to grab a portion of Mint’s over 3 million users. However one investor says companies shouldn’t try to be the next Mint.

Sheel Mohnot co-founder and partner at Better Tomorrow Ventures tweeted on X “Heard of a few people building a new version of @mint now that Intuit shut it down. I wouldn’t recommend it if you want to build a venture-scale business. There aren’t that many people who want to actively manage their finances; startup graveyard is littered with PFM’s.”

Yes Mohnot is most likely biased. He is after all an investor in finance tracker Albert. Speaking with me recently Mohnot said years ago he looked at many of the concepts being built with the aim of competing with Mint — Albert included.

“Seven or eight years ago there were a ton of funded companies all seed-funded with some even raising a Series A” Mohnot said. “However none of them hit any sort of scale with the PFM (personal finance management product). They all had to pivot into something else to make it work.”

It is widely reported that most Americans will have trouble if an unexpected $400 bill comes up. So actively managing your money — and a free product to boot — can be attractive. Except that as it turns out it isn’t.

Mohnot explained that Albert founders also had to shift strategy when they realized that people don’t actually want to manage their own money. They want a solution to do it for them.

“The AI manages their money and there’s a lot more people who want that” Mohnot said. “They have hundreds of millions in revenue to show that.”

So should companies try to be the next Mint? A free product like Mint was is most likely not going to yield a “venture-scale business” according to Mohnot.

Like Albert other companies are finding success with subscription-based finance tracking models. Just after Intuit’s announcement in early November Monarch Money told me they saw the number of users joining its platform increase 20x. Meanwhile Copilot told me they saw numbers spike 5x. Mohnot referred to both Copilot and Monarch as “good products” and does see some additional promising models here.

“Where I have seen some interesting companies is managing high-net worth people’s money because people are willing to spend a lot” Mohnot said. “You have to either get a wide audience with a low-cost product or go up market and charge a lot of money. If you do have this PFM product it has to be a suite of products.”

Since then other personal financial apps reached out to tell me how their user base has grown in light of the Mint news:

Eric Dunn CEO of Quicken said “Quicken Simplifi has seen the highest volume of user subscriptions since its launch in January 2020.”

Customers at financial router Sequence grew by 30%.

Bill organizer and budgeting platform PocketGuard said total registrations grew 3x while total revenue jumped 4x.

Yet when it comes to employment in India Inc. persons with disabilities make up less than 0.5 percent of the employee base in India’s top firms. So what does India Inc. need to do to make their workplace barrier-free for persons with disabilities?

Disability inclusion is central to the promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The commitment requires corporates to collaborate with the government partners and other stakeholders to find innovative solutions for enabling the active participation of persons with disabilities in their full diversity and their full inclusion in all decision-making processes. As we continue to strengthen our commitment to equality structured interventions throughout the employee lifecycle of a person with disability will be necessary for realizing their ability to contribute of themselves. Access to knowledge and skills practical tools and assistive.

For International Day of Persons with Disabilities leaders from Accenture in India Nutanix India and Marlabs share their perspective on why building diverse teams and inclusive work ecosystems matter how-create a barrier-free workplace for persons with disabilities and technology as a driver of more human-centered ways of working.

Sanjay Dawar Managing Director Global Strategy & Consulting and Persons with Disabilities Sponsor Accenture in India

“It an acknowledged fact that diversity ushers in a richness of ideas and perspectives which is critical to growth and innovation and a culture of equality empathy and respect is vital to nurturing this diversity.

As per a recent Accenture research in order to make progress on disability inclusion organisations need to have framework that addresses five key challenges – access awareness advocacy action and accountability.

At Accenture we promote a barrier-free culture that enables all our people to bring their unique skills and strengths to contribute and thrive at work. Technology plays a key role. Our workplace applications and platforms are built accessible by design.

We give our people access to a range of technologies and accessibility enablement such as assistive devices and technologies ergonomic support flexible work arrangements sign language interpreters and more. Our progressive medical insurance program supports enablement such as assistive devices.

Our Accessibility Center in India offers enablement services and showcases our assistive technology solutions across vision auditory speech mobility impairments mental wellness and neurodiversity. It allows our people to experience a variety of leading-edge assistive devices technologies and customises them for their unique needs.”

Sankalp Saxena Senior Vice President and Managing Director Operations Nutanix India

“Diverse teams bring together individuals with different perspectives experiences and backgrounds fostering a more comprehensive and creative approach to problem-solving. This diversity of thought stimulates innovation and leads to more effective solutions. Inclusive work environments foster a sense of belonging and psychological safety leading to higher levels of employee engagement and motivation. When employees feel valued and respected they are more likely to contribute their best efforts and go the extra mile.

Training for all employees about disability awareness and etiquette which will help them in understanding the challenges faced by people with disabilities and encourage them to create a safe and inclusive environment. While India Inc has made significant progress in creating accessible workplaces there is room for considerable improvement. At Nutanix India we have proactively ensured all our workspaces are fully compliant to these norms and this has further motivated all our teams to embrace diverse hiring practices and ensuring an inclusive workplace. Having said that we are looking at certainly doing more and are keen to learn from our industry peers on what further steps can be taken.

Fortunately technology has come a long way in providing digital features such as speech-to-text closed captioning and ‘ALT text’ features that help professionals with disabilities overcome communication challenges with their peers in multiple formats. As technology continues to evolve it will play an even greater role in enabling more human-centered ways of working. By harnessing the power of technology we can create a more equitable productive and fulfilling work experience for everyone.”

Purnima Menon Chief Marketing Officer Marlabs

“In a world where organizations must constantly evolve it’s imperative to stay relevant motivating employees to achieve extraordinary results. Organizations can tune into this new frequency by enabling a diverse and inclusive workplace. It is time that inclusivity went beyond a mere lip service. Today human-centred technology enables people to engage connect and stay productive in many ways. Whether it’s self-service tools for auto resolution real-time feedback and course correction or simply elevating productivity through online courseware for remote employees we cannot ignore the impact of technology. Assistive technologies like OCR Adaptive Keyboards and Braille displays are proving to be of great help for employees who may be differently abled. While in the past rampways accessible washrooms and handrails enabled employees to access the facility assistive technologies today ensure employees remain productive and engaged. It’s not only strategic but also vital to build an integrated diversity and inclusivity charter and to make technology a catalyst in building and sustaining a motivated workforce.

Inclusion matters to everyone. In fact a recent Bain study shows how the exponential impact and productivity across organizations invested in diversity and inclusivity. Organizations actively promoting a culture of inclusivity see a sharp acceleration in employee productivity. Clearly a sense of belonging enables us to be more creative and innovative problem-solvers for our teams and the organization at large.”

Anjali Byce CHRO STL.

“I firmly believe that the true strength of innovation lies in the diversity of thought that diverse teams bring to the table. Building diverse teams and fostering inclusive work ecosystems isn’t just a moral imperative; it’s a strategic advantage. Diverse perspectives ignite creativity drive innovation and enhance problem-solving propelling us forward in an ever-evolving business landscape.

Creating a barrier-free workplace for persons with disabilities is not merely a compliance measure for us at STL—it’s a cornerstone of our ethos. Our commitment extends beyond physical accessibility to encompass a holistic inclusive environment. By conducting disability audits implementing tailored training programs and investing in technologies that break down communication barriers we’re setting a standard for creating workspaces where everyone regardless of ability can thrive.

Technology in my view is a powerful enabler of human-centered ways of working. By leveraging cutting-edge solutions we’re not just streamlining processes; we’re enhancing the human experience. From assistive technologies that empower our colleagues with disabilities to collaborative platforms that transcend physical boundaries we’re embracing a future where technology fosters a more inclusive empathetic and interconnected workplace.

At STL we see diversity inclusivity and technology not as checkboxes but as integral components of a forward-thinking strategy that propels us towards a future where every voice is heard every talent is valued and innovation knows no bounds.”

Devesh Amin Global Head of Infrastructure & APAC IT Intuit India

An inclusive and barrier-free workplace is not merely a goal; it is the very essence of innovation and success. Through awareness programs establishment of accessible physical and technological spaces provision of flexible work arrangements championing diversity and inclusion initiatives adoption of supportive policies and offering opportunities for career development employers can forge an environment conducive to the flourishing of disabled employees.

At Intuit we recognise the value of diverse perspectives making efforts to create inclusive workplaces that accommodate different abilities.

Almost 10% of our workforce consists of accessibility champions (Intuit Accessibility Champion program) dedicated to advancing these initiatives. They undergo foundational training in disability etiquette and inclusive design. This initiative has emerged as a model for other companies seeking to establish an inclusive network of leaders.

With 2023 almost behind us it's a great time to think about the new investing year just ahead. This doesn't mean you should completely revamp your portfolio but instead consider what may be missing from your holdings -- and if you have some cash available and the price of a particular stock is right make those additions.

One area to focus on is companies that generally offer steady earnings growth over time. Healthcare is the perfect place to find these players since patients need their medicines or procedures no matter what the economy is doing. Within this group you'll find tried-and-true names as well as up-and-coming players that may deliver an extra dose of growth.

Let's take a look at five of these top stocks to add to your portfolio before the new year.

1. CRISPR Therapeutics

CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP 2.23%) just reached a huge milestone and another may be just ahead. The company recently won the world's first authorization for a CRISPR-based gene-editing treatment when the U.K. gave the nod to exa-cel (to be commercialized as Casgevy). U.S. regulators are set to decide on the blood disorders treatment for sickle cell disease this month -- then for beta thalassemia in March.

This is big because it represents product revenue just ahead and this revenue could reach blockbuster levels. It's also a key event because it serves as a vote of confidence for the technology CRISPR Therapeutics uses across its pipeline. The company even has another candidate -- potential immuno-oncology treatment CTX-110 -- involved in a late-stage study that could support a regulatory request.

Meanwhile CRISPR Therapeutics stock is trading at a much lower level than it did in the past when we had less visibility about the future. Considering that this biotech is in the early stages of its story over time the shares could soar from today's level.

2. Eli Lilly

Eli Lilly (LLY -0.39%) has taken center stage thanks to its diabetes drug Mounjaro which doctors also have been prescribing for weight loss. In fact Mounjaro and rival products have become so popular that patients have faced shortages of the drugs as supply can't keep up with demand.

Lilly is increasing production capacity and in more good news the company recently won regulatory approval for the same molecule to specifically address weight loss. Lilly will sell the product as Zepbound. Mounjaro brought in $1.4 billion in sales during the most recent quarter so there's reason to be optimistic about the potential of both drugs to drive growth.

But Lilly isn't about just one or two products or one treatment area. The company sells dozens of products in areas including immunology cancer and neuroscience. And these drugs helped the company increase revenue 37% in the quarter with new products and growth products leading the gains.

Considering current growth and future potential thanks to new and high-growth products Lilly shares even after recent gains are likely to head higher over time.

3. Vertex Pharmaceuticals

Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX -1.13%) is known for its leadership in the global cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment market and its CF drugs have brought in billions of dollars in earnings. This is set to continue into the next decade thanks to current products and a very promising candidate in pivotal development right now.

So we can be confident about the CF program generating billion-dollar earnings well into the future. But Vertex is about to offer patients and investors even more. The company partnered with CRISPR Therapeutics on Casgevy -- so will benefit from sales there.

And Vertex is working on a candidate to address the very common problem of pain with VX-548 on track to complete its pivotal program by the end of this year. The company aims to share data from the trial early next year and if it's positive a commercial launch may not be far off.

You'll love Vertex for its all of the above -- and its reasonable valuation as it trades for 23x forward earnings estimates.

4. Intuitive Surgical

Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 0.45%) is the worldwide leader in robotic surgery with its flagship da Vinci system now installed in 8285 locations. What I like most about Intuitive is its moat or competitive advantage which should ensure ongoing market leadership.

Robotic systems cost millions of dollars so it's unlikely hospitals will easily switch to another provider if they're satisfied with the current platform. Also most doctors train on the da Vinci so they probably will support the idea of sticking with a system they know well.

I also like the fact that Intuitive generates most of its revenue not from selling the surgical robots -- but from selling the instruments and accessories needed for each surgery. This is great because it represents recurrent revenue and practically guarantees that every da Vinci sold or leased will keep generating income for Intuitive.

Intuitive shares have climbed this year but they're still trading lower in relation to forward earnings estimates than they were a couple of years ago. This and solid future prospects make the stock a great deal today.

5. Pfizer

Pfizer's (PFE -0.32%) revenue surged to record highs last year thanks to its coronavirus vaccine and treatment but today the big pharma faces two challenges: a decline in coronavirus product revenue and upcoming losses of exclusivity of certain older blockbusters.

That's soured some investors on Pfizer but this actually creates a top buying opportunity for the rest of us. The stock now trades for only 18.4 times forward earnings estimates.

Why buy Pfizer now? Because the company is set to compensate for patent losses and grow beyond them. Pfizer is in the middle of its biggest launch streak ever -- releasing 19 new products or indications over an 18-month period. It's completed 13 launches so far showing it's well on the way to meeting the goal.

Pfizer predicts non-COVID program revenues could reach $84 billion by 2030 representing more than 60% growth from pre-pandemic revenue.

Meanwhile you also can count on Pfizer for passive income -- the company is making dividend growth a priority and delivers a dividend yield that's higher than that of the S&P 500.

All of this makes Pfizer a top addition to your portfolio now so that you'll benefit from passive income in 2024 and likely share performance over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,
IVZ,Invesco,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAzL2JldHRlci1ldGYtdG8tYnV5LXZhbmd1YXJkLWdyb3d0aC1mdW5kLXZzLWludmVzY28v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better ETF to Buy: Vanguard Growth Fund vs. Invesco QQQ Trust,"Take a look at how these two popular growth funds match up.

Investing in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) makes sense for almost any investor.

Buying ETFs is the easiest way to put together a diversified portfolio of stocks without having to do the hard work of managing them yourself. Typically the only additional cost to owning an ETF is a modest expense ratio which could be just a fraction of a penny on the dollar.

The most popular ETFs track the S&P 500 but investors have a wide range of options beyond these basic index funds. If you are a growth stock investor two ETFs worth looking at are the Vanguard Growth Fund (VUG 0.32%) which tracks the performance of the CRSP U.S. Large Cap Growth Index and the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ 0.30%) which tracks the Nasdaq-100 index made up of the 100 biggest non-financial companies traded on the Nasdaq stock exchange.

Let's take a look at how the Vanguard Growth Fund and the Invesco QQQ Trust compare to each other to see which is the better buy today.

Vanguard Growth Fund vs. Invesco QQQ Trust: holdings

It might not come as a surprise that these ETFs have many overlapping holdings. After all they're both focused on large-cap stocks and skew toward growth companies. One key difference is that the Invesco QQQ Trust is made up exclusively of Nasdaq stocks while the Vanguard Growth Fund also holds stocks that trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

The chart below shows the top 10 holdings in each fund and their exposure.

Top 10 VUG Holdings Exposure Top 10 QQQ Holdings Exposure Apple 13.02% Apple 11.02% Microsoft 12.89% Microsoft 10.37% Alphabet 6.95% Alphabet 6.04% Amazon 6.34% Amazon 5.67% Nvidia 4.91% Nvidia 4.16% Meta Platforms 3.44% Meta Platforms 3.87% Tesla 2.78% Broadcom 3.07% Eli Lilly 2.43% Tesla 2.63% Visa 1.88% Adobe 2.26% Mastercard 1.62% Costco 2.10%

The Vanguard Growth Fund holds 221 stocks compared to just 100 stocks in the Invesco QQQ Trust so it might seem surprising the Vanguard fund has more exposure to the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks than the QQQ does. That's likely due to a special rebalancing in the Nasdaq-100 that helped diversify it away from those big tech stocks earlier this year.

Vanguard Growth Fund vs. Invesco QQQ Trust: performance

While it's important to understand how the holdings differ between these two ETFs the most important factor in your decision is likely going to be performance.

While past performance isn't a guarantee of future returns it's a good place to start especially since one can't analyze the ""underlying business"" of an ETF in the way that one can with an individual stock.

The chart below shows how these two ETFs and the SPDR S&P 500 ETF have performed since 2004.

As you can see the Invesco QQQ Trust has beaten the Vanguard Growth Fund by a wide margin during that time but both ETFs have topped the SPDR S&P 500 ETF showing that owning either one has been a reliable way to outperform the broad market long term.

The Invesco QQQ Trust has also outperformed the Vanguard Growth Fund in more recent time frames as well showing a consistent track record of besting its fellow growth fund.

Other factors

In addition to the holdings and performance the two other factors worth considering in evaluating an ETF are the expense ratio and the dividend yield.

The Vanguard Growth Fund has an expense ratio of just 0.04% and offers a dividend yield of 0.62%. The Invesco QQQ Trust meanwhile is more expensive with an expense ratio of 0.20% and it pays an identical dividend yield of 0.62%.

Which is the better ETF to buy?

Given the Invesco fund's stronger track record it's worth paying the higher expense ratio to own it. However the Invesco fund's advantage could be diminished by the rebalancing that took place this year especially as the Vanguard fund now has more exposure to the top tech stocks.

To hedge your bets you could easily invest in both of these ETFs but between the two the Invesco QQQ ETF is more deserving of your investment dollars.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9uZXdzbGV0dGVycy8yMDIzLTEyLTAyL2NvbXBhbmllcy1hcmUtYnV5aW5nLWJhY2stdGhlaXItb3duLWRlYnQtYXQtZGVlcC1kaXNjb3VudHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Companies Are Buying Back Their Own Debt at Deep Discounts,"Why did this happen?

An off-the-shelf balanced portfolio will typically have 60 per cent in global equities and 40 per cent in bonds because bonds typically do well when equities have fallen shielding investors from the worst of stock market losses. But that wasn’t the case in 2022 when shares fell heavily but bonds even more so hurting those who most needed protection. An allocation to gold which is now trading close to its all-time high would have given these investors a better outcome.

A portfolio with 60 per cent in the Vanguard All World exchange traded fund (ETF) and 40 per cent in the iShares Global Aggregate Bond ETF would be up 32.2 per",,,,,,

The global AI in medical imaging market is expected to expand at the double digit CAGR of 33.1% during the forecast period 2023 to 2032 according to a report done by Precedence Research.

One of the most promising areas of health and medical innovation is the use of AI in medical imaging.

According to a NIH report machine learning a subset of AI also known as the traditional AI was applied on diagnostic imaging starting in the 1980’s within fields like radiology and oncology.



Though AI plays a significant role and is evolving in medical imaging research today implementing AI in medical imaging research faces challenges.

These challenges can lie in organizing and pre-processing data from different institutions hindering widespread predictive modeling.

While breakthroughs like ""deep patient"" offer a method for general-purpose patient representation adapting it to diverse clinical settings remains complex according to the NIH report.

Authors of the report stress that image data sharing poses policy and infrastructure challenges addressing HIPAA compliance and inadequate systems.

Achieving true AI intelligence comparable to human decision-making requires addressing not only data and algorithm challenges but also ethical regulations acknowledging the unique life experiences and philosophies involved in medical imaging decisions.

While significant leaps are being made in this space in addressing its challenges increases in the market are a result. These increases include:

The North America AI in medical imaging market size accounted for $379.11 million in 2022 and is projected to reach around $5680.48 million by 2032 expanding at a healthy CAGR of 33.60% from 2023 to 2032.

The Europe AI in medical imaging market size accounted for $284.14 million in 2022 and is anticipated to reach around $3989 million by 2032 expanding at a healthy CAGR of 32.60% from 2023 to 2032.

The Asia Pacific AI in medical imaging market size accounted for $219.64 million in 2022 and is anticipated to reach around $3407.61 million by 2032 progressing a healthy CAGR of 34.20% from 2023 to 2032.

The LAMEA AI in medical imaging market size accounted for $99.27 million in 2022 and is anticipated to reach around $1194.71 million by 2032 progressing a healthy CAGR of 30.10% from 2023 to 2032.

AI in medical imaging has revolutionized medicine enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficiency according to the report.

Utilizing advanced deep-learning algorithms it accelerates image interpretation aiding doctors in swift decision-making during CT scans or X-rays.

AI's efforts prove crucial in monitoring subtle changes particularly in conditions like brain tumors and cancers contributing to precision medicine.

This technology lifts the workload on medical professionals automating analysis and addressing the global shortage of healthcare personnel.

Forty participants are using 48 campsites the most they can do right now said Ann Hruska secretary of Lake Antoine Park Partners which organizes the event.

“That’s about the limit to allow snowplowing to happen. They still have to plow the road and have a place to put it (the snow)” she explained.

“We have a waiting list and more people than spots this year” she said.

The event opened on Thanksgiving and extends through New Year’s Day. The public can drive through the park from dusk until 10 p.m. at no charge.

“We told the displays to be on by 4 (p.m.) because people start driving through early” Hruska said adding the displays are on timers. She asks that the public follow the signs and turn left when they enter the park.

The event has continued to grow. The first year had 18 participants then 30 last year.

Some have been in each year including Breitung Township Bacco Construction Boss Snowplow Erickson’s Jewelry Champion Inc. WJNR the Kiwanis Club Coldwell Homes the Dickinson County Road Commission Granny K’s Stop and Play and a couple of church groups.

She said they have one group that will decorate the snow fence at the beach.

“LAPP is grateful to all these folks that put up displays. Not only is it a financial commitment on their part but there’s a lot of creativity and team building and cold fingers that have gone into this” Hruska said. “It’s not easy to put up these displays in the cold. The ground is hard and you have to really plan for a lot of wind and snow. It takes a lot to anchor these displays. We had a 30-mile-an-hour wind the other day and you can tell.”

“We realize that takes a lot of effort. Some of them have been planning for a while for their display; you can tell. Every year folks kind of put a little more thought into it and it’s especially fun when it represents their business or their organization when it really speaks about them and you see that this year” she said.

Participants pay $30 per site and the money goes back into the event as they try to improve on the previous year. They added more lights at the entrance. Next year they may allow pavilions to be decorated.

For the first time they will be presenting a People’s Choice award. The public can vote online on the group’s Facebook page or in person at the park office/store. More than 200 votes already have been cast.

“It’s fun to watch the changes in voting” she said. “It’s early. There’s lots of voting time left.” Votes will be accepted until 10 p.m. Dec. 17.

The winner will receive $500 and “a cool hanging light bulb award that they can hang in their display so if people see a large red hanging light bulb they know they’re the winner.”

Also new this year is a open house planned from 6 to 8 p.m. Sunday Dec. 17 at the office.

“One of the participants asked if they could be present in their display at some point to greet people and put a face to those beautiful displays” Hruska explained. “We struggled with that because we want to make it safe and not have people driving and walking in the same place. Visitors will be able to drive through. Folks that have displays will be able to stand in their displays and give out candy or trinkets. Afterward the public can come to the office area.”

The Kingsford High School chorus will sing Christmas carols and the LAPP will provide free hot chocolate. Santa also will be on site.

“We thought that probably two hours is enough time to stand out in the cold” she said.

“Another cool thing is we have Upper Limits Media who will shoot some drone footage to post on Facebook so that folks near and far that can’t get out to the park can see the lights” she said adding they are donating their time.

Lake Antoine Park Partners also thanks the Dickinson County Road Commission for helping with traffic signage for the event. Specialty Granules decorated the front gates.

“We consider all those with displays and those who help behind the scenes as contributors to a big holiday gift to our community” Hruska said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmlyb25tb3VudGFpbmRhaWx5bmV3cy5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjMvMTIvZGVlci1oYXJ2ZXN0LWRpcHMtaW4tdXAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Deer harvest dips in UP | News Sports Jobs - The Daily News,"IRON MOUNTAIN — Warm weather on the opening days of the firearm deer season contributed to an apparent drop in the Upper Peninsula harvest.

With the 16-day season having ended Thursday hunters have until Sunday to report late-season harvests to the Michigan Department of Natural Resources’ online tracker.

Totals across the Upper Peninsula are trending down from 2022 which was the first year of mandatory reporting.

Menominee County is again the leader in the region. Its reported firearm harvest as of 5 p.m. Friday was 2139 antlered and 835 antlerless which compares a 2022 firearm total of 2492 antlered and 1256 antlerless.

Delta County shows a 2023 firearm harvest of 1958 to date including 1518 bucks. That compares to a 2022 total of 2499 which included 1716 bucks.

Dickinson County’s firearm harvest to date is 717 bucks and 245 antlerless which compares with 974 bucks and 366 antlerless in 2022. For Iron County the 2023 numbers are 665 antlered and 265 antlerless compared to 1032 and 555 in 2022.

Marquette County shows a 2023 firearm harvest to date of 866 antlered and 43 antlerless which is down from 1413 antlered and 105 antlerless a year ago.

Brian Roell wildlife biologist at the DNR’s Marquette office said warm and windy conditions on opening day were less than ideal.

For all of the U.P. the reported Nov. 15 harvest totals dropped from 3841 in 2022 to 2696 this year a 30% decrease. The buck count dropped from 3400 to 2489 a 27% decrease.

About 80% of the deer harvested in the firearm season are taken in the first couple of days Roell noted. Tough winters the past two years may have lowered the birth weights of fawns and taken a toll on adults as well as fawns he said.

Some hunters are unaware of the mandatory harvest reporting requirement or choose to ignore it Roell added. The agency will keep working on ways to get the message out he said.

Michigan’s muzzleloader season opened Friday and runs through Sunday Dec. 10.

Wisconsin’s muzzleloader season opened Monday and ends Wednesday. That will be followed by a four-day statewide antlerless hunt where all weapon types are allowed running through Dec. 10.

Hunters may use any unfilled antlerless harvest authorization but it must be used in the zone county and land type designated on the permit.

Applications for the 2024 spring turkey season in Wisconsin are due by the end of Dec. 10. Wisconsin black bear applications are also due Dec. 10.

Michigan’s spring turkey application period starts in January while the bear application period is in May.

Wisconsin’s lake trout season in Lake Superior is open and runs until Sept. 30 or until the harvest cap is met. To harvest a lake trout anglers must purchase a 2023-2024 general fishing license and a Great Lakes trout and salmon stamp. Licenses and stamps can be purchased online through the Go Wild system or at any license sales location.

Ice safety is urged on all waterbodies especially at this time of year. Frigid overnight temperatures often leave a thin layer of ice across smaller bodies of water but that ice is not strong enough to support the weight of a person or machine.

“After we have these first cold nights we start to see the early ice forming. It may look solid to the naked eye but it’s not” said Lt. Jacob Holsclaw Wisconsin DNR off-highway vehicle administrator. “There can be cracks and changes in the ice thickness that you won’t see until it’s too late.”

10.8 PPG 6.2 RPG 5.8 APG through five games

MOUNTAIN IRON Minn.- The Mountain Iron-Buhl girls basketball team is right on track in their bid for a second-straight state championship. That’s likely due to the Rangers’ terrific twosome: Jordan Zubich and Hali Savela.

Zubich has long been the face of Mountain Iron-Buhl girls’ basketball but she admits that Savela plays a major role in her success. “(Hali’s) going to do all the little things for us which makes my job 10 times easier.”

Savela now a senior is also one of the Rangers’ co-captains. “It’s kind of crazy I can’t believe it went this fast.” She remarked. “It’s so fun doing it one last time and we’re trying to soak the memories up.”

Savela is second on the team with 10.8 points per game and 6.2 rebounds per game while she leads Mountain Iron-Buhl with 5.8 assists per game.

“She plays every position for us and it’s nice to have somebody like that” Says MIB Head Coach Jeff Buffetta. “She can play in the post she can bring the ball up she’s willing to do what it takes and she’s always been that way and it’s definitely a good weapon to have.”

Savela and Zubich make up one of the most dangerous duos in Minnesota but that’s nothing new for either of them. “We’ve been playing (together) our whole life.” says Savela. “We actually support each other really well through all of the accomplishments. We work really well together so we just mesh on and off the court which makes it really easy to play. We do everything together. We’re in student council we do the yearbook She’s such a fun person she’s a great personality.”

“She’s been my best friend since like kindergarten” smiled Zubich. “I mean we do everything together…We have all the same classes.”

Savela is now focused on finishing her time in high school with another state title. “We have the same team. We’re going to shoot we’re going to run a fast-paced game and I think it’s going to be really fun.”

Following this season Savela will continue her basketball career at the University of Jamestown which will join the NSIC in the NCAA Division II in 2024-25.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhdG9kYXluZS5pbi92aXN1YWxzdG9yaWVzL3dlYnN0b3JpZXMvbW9zdC1zZWN1cmUtdmF1bHRzLWluLXRoZS13b3JsZC03OTYxMi0wMi0xMi0yMDIz0gFlaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWF0b2RheW5lLmluL3Zpc3VhbHN0b3JpZXMvd2Vic3Rvcmllcy9tb3N0LXNlY3VyZS12YXVsdHMtaW4tdGhlLXdvcmxkLTc5NjEyLTAyLTEyLTIwMjM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Most Secure Vaults in the World,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.indiatodayne.in', port=443): Read timed out.

Jabil Inc. and Builders FirstSource Inc. are set to join too.

San Francisco-based Uber and the latter two companies will replace Sealed Air Corp. Alaska Air Group Inc. and SolarEdge Technologies Inc. in the S&P 500 respectively. The new additions will join the index prior to the market opening on December 18 S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a press release late Friday.

Shares of Uber were up 7.3% in after-hours trading. They’ve gained 132% this year. Shares of manufacturing services company Jabil were up by 4.6% and supplier and manufacturer Builders FirstSource saw post-market gains of close to 7%.

Wall Street analysts had predicted Uber would be added to the index after the company’s third-quarter results showed a second consecutive profitable quarter — a financial viability requirement for inclusion in the benchmark index. Prior to its inclusion Uber was one of the largest US companies eligible to be added to the S&P 500 with a market capitalization of over $118 billion.

Uber’s rideshare business continued to expand faster than analysts expected in the third quarter thanks to improvements in driver supply and trip growth from back-to-school rides and the return of corporate travel. Uber also included new offerings in the past quarter such as partnering with Alphabet Inc.’s Waymo to provide ride-hailing of autonomous vehicles on its app starting in Phoenix. Gross bookings in the mobility or rideshare business jumped 31%.

Uber’s inclusion in the world’s most-watched index will embolden Chief Executive Officer Dara Khosrowshahi’s mission to focus on profitability said Mandeep Singh technology analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.

“It also establishes Uber’s category leadership position among the gig economy peers"" Singh said adding that scale is “the most important thing"" for any marketplace and Uber has proven it has that both on the demand and supply sides.

To qualify for the S&P 500 companies must be highly liquid US firms with a market capitalization of at least $14.5 billion and must meet profitability liquidity and share-float standards. As of October thresholds for the S&P MidCap 400 Index and S&P SmallCap 600 Index are $5.2 billion to $14.5 billion and $850 million to $5.2 billion respectively.

Additions and removals to the S&P 500 often but not always happen when the index is rebalanced each quarter. They can also occur at other points of the year like after mergers and acquisitions. S&P Dow Jones Indices makes these adjustments to account for shifts in market capitalizations and on occasion to adjust for market gyrations.

Inclusion in the benchmark is becoming more important for companies in a world increasingly dominated by passive investment funds. Furthermore a spot in the coveted S&P 500 boosts a firm’s investor profile and adds to trading liquidity — factors that can potentially propel a company’s stock price higher.

Kevin Jacobs received a star as the newest Brigadier General and Chief of Staff for the Guard.

He has become the first Black general officer in the history of the organization.

His promotion ceremony took place on Saturday afternoon at the 126th Air Refueling Wing on Scott Air Force Base.

The O'Fallon native has served in the Guard for nearly 40 years.

""I'm honored to congratulate Air Force Colonel Kevin Jacobs on his promotion to brigadier general and on becoming the highest-ranking Black officer in the Illinois Air National Guard's history"" said Gov. JB Pritzker. ""Colonel Jacobs' promotion speaks to the continued progress the Illinois National Guard has made in ensuring historically underrepresented communities are fairly represented within its ranks and given the opportunity to excel at the highest levels of leadership as Colonel Jacobs has clearly done and will certainly continue to do.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3NsaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMTIvc3RhZmYtc2d0LWphY29iLWdhbGxpaGVyLWtpbGxlZC1pbi1haXItZm9yY2UtY3Jhc2gtYnJvdWdodC1vdXQtdGhlLWJlc3QuaHRtbNIBgQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXNzbGl2ZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzLzEyL3N0YWZmLXNndC1qYWNvYi1nYWxsaWhlci1raWxsZWQtaW4tYWlyLWZvcmNlLWNyYXNoLWJyb3VnaHQtb3V0LXRoZS1iZXN0Lmh0bWw_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Staff Sgt. Jacob Galliher killed in Air Force crash ‘brought out the best’,"The Massachusetts airman killed when his aircraft went down off the coast of Japan on Wednesday was “a quiet leader” known for hard work and bringing out the best in those around him his former football coach and others who knew him said Friday.

The military on Thursday informed the family of Staff Sgt. Jacob Galliher a native of Pittsfield that rescue crews had recovered his body from the ocean a family member said. Another seven airmen also on board the lost aircraft were still missing Friday according to the Air Force.

Galliher joined the Air Force after graduating in 2017 from Taconic High School in Pittsfield where he played football.

Former Pittsfield Public Schools Athletic Director Jim Abel said Galliher was “an approachable popular fun-loving student at Taconic” who “embodied the characteristics you’d like to see demonstrated by your son your student or your teammate.”

Pittsfield Fire Department Capt. Jim Ziter who coached Taconic football until 2020 said Galliher was “one of the hardest workers” on the team possessed “a great sense of humor” and “brought out the best in all his teammates.”

Galliher joined the football team as a freshman and was a talented running back and defensive back — “but more importantly a great kid” Ziter said in a phone call with MassLive on Friday.

“He never had a bad thing to say about anything” Ziter said. “He was a quiet leader but he didn’t have to be vocal. He led by example.”

Abel said Galliher was part of a group of “committed gritty selfless athletes” whose hard work built the football team from a period of lopsided losses to its first Western Massachusetts Championship in Galliher’s senior season.

“Jake Galliher was one of those student-athletes that helped set the tone and culture of the school – on the playing fields and more importantly in the classrooms and school hallways” Abel said by email Friday.

A flag outside Taconic High School hung at half-staff Friday as news spread of Galliher’s death. In a statement school Principal Dr. Matthew Bishop said Galliher “embodied the values that we hope to instill in all of our students.”

Galliher left behind his wife Ivy 2-year-old and 7-week-old sons “a loving family and countless friends all of whom are grappling with this profound loss” a statement from Galliher’s family on Friday said. The family lives on a military base in Japan.

“Jake was an amazing father son and brother dedicated to his family and friends and we look forward to telling his story when the time is right” the statement. For now the family asked for privacy as they processed an “unimaginable loss.”

They extended their thoughts and support to the families of the seven other crew members missing after the aircraft crash on Wednesday.

The Air Force Special Operations Command said a CV-22B Osprey a plane-helicopter hybrid “was involved in an aircraft mishap while performing a routine training mission off the shore of Yakushima Island Japan” on Wednesday. At a press briefing Thursday Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said the cause of the crash remained under investigation.

U.S. Rep. Richard Neal D-1st District who represents Pittsfield said in a statement that Galliher “represented our nation’s best.”

“As a father my heart goes out to Staff Sgt. Jacob Galliher’s mother and father during this difficult time” Neal said Friday. “Any parent will tell you there is no greater pain than the pain of losing a child and Jacob Galliher was beloved by all.”

Galliher was a military linguist stationed in Japan a role for which he trained two years. He was fluent in Mandarin Chinese his family told the Berkshire Eagle.

“The Galliher family is enduring every service family’s nightmare and we hold them in our hearts and prayers as they grieve” Massachusetts Veterans Services Secretary Jon Santiago said in a statement Friday. “May his memory serve as a source of solace and strength to his family friends and fellow servicemembers. Our Massachusetts military community extends our deepest condolences to his family and will honor his legacy.”

Gov. Maura Healey mourned Galliher’s loss in a statement Friday and said her thoughts were with “his family especially his two young sons and the Berkshire County community as they mourn the loss of one of their best and brightest.”

Yakushima Island near where the Osprey crashed is about 40 miles southwest of the Japanese mainland.

The Osprey aircraft takes off and lands like a helicopter but during flight can rotate its propellers forward and cruise much faster like an airplane.

Ospreys have had a number of accidents in the past including in Japan where they are deployed at U.S. and Japanese military bases.

In Okinawa where about half of the 50000 American troops are based Gov. Denny Tamaki told reporters Wednesday that he would ask the U.S. military to suspend all Osprey flights in Japan the Associated Press reported.

Tom Suozzi to take back expelled Santos' seat,"The Democratic Party by mid-week will nominate a candidate to run in the special election early next year to replace expelled serial liar and criminal defendant Rep. George Santos — and it’s all but certain to be former Congressman Tom Suozzi sources said Sunday.

State Democratic Democratic Party Chairman and Nassau County leader Jay Jacobs said the decision could come as early as Tuesday and no later than Wednesday.

In a telling sign Jacobs said Gov. Hochul has no interest in blocking Suozzi’s bid despite the fact that he ran a primary campaign against her last year.

Suozzi ran to the right of Hochul on issues such as public safety — including the unpopular cashless bail law — which Republican Lee Zeldin used against her in the general election.

But Jacobs said Democrat Hochul a former Buffalo-area congresswoman wants her party to win the seat.

“It’s not in the governor’s character to hold a grudge. It’s not who she is. She’s looking for the candidate with the best chance of winning. She’s made that clear to me” Jacobs said.

Democratic Party insiders in the 3rd Congressional District that covers Long Island and parts of Queens said there’s little doubt Suozzi will get the nomination.

Sources said House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee have made clear they want Suozzi — a moderate Democrat and proven vote-getter in prior races for the House and Nassau County executive — to get the nomination.

Queens Democratic Party leader Rep. Gregory Meeks is also on board with Suozzi.

“There’s no question it will be Tom. Hakeem and the DCCC are driving this process” one Democratic source familiar with the deliberations said.

The Republican parties in Nassau and Queens are expected to name a candidate to replace Santos by week’s end.

The GOP leaders got burned for failing to properly vet the fabulist Santos — who lied about virtually every aspect of his life — and have said that won’t happen again.

A screening committee is interviewing more than two-dozen wannabes who’ve expressed interest in running for the seat — though since it’s a special election only one will be chosen.

GOP insiders said candidates in the top tier for consideration include Nassau County legislator Mazi Pilip an Ethiopian-Israeli American who is a veteran of the Israel Defense Forces; state Sen. Jack Martins and retired NYPD Detective and security consultant Mike Sapraicone.

Nassau County Republican Chairman Joseph Cairo said he has an open mind.

“We may have an unknown diamond in the rough” Cairo said Sunday.

While Suozzi is a proven getter even Democrats said there will be a real fight for the seat.

After redistricting the 3rd Congressional District is more conservative than it was the last time Suozzi ran and Republicans have wiped out Democratic incumbents for all the major county-wide offices in recent election cycles while pounding their opponents for unpopular Democratic-approved policies such as the controversial cashless bail law.

Zeldin who is from Long Island carried the 3rd by 14 points over Hochul in last year’s governor’s race and Santos handily defeated Democrat Robert Zimmerman — before his lies alleged campaign fundraising corruption and ethical breaches caught up with him — after the election ultimately leading to his ouster.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZm94NXNhbmRpZWdvLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3BldGVyLWZyYW1wdG9ucy1uZXZlci1ldmVyLXNheS1uZXZlci10b3VyLWNvbWluZy10by1zYW4tZGllZ28v0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3g1c2FuZGllZ28uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvcGV0ZXItZnJhbXB0b25zLW5ldmVyLWV2ZXItc2F5LW5ldmVyLXRvdXItY29taW5nLXRvLXNhbi1kaWVnby9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Peter Frampton’s ‘Never EVER Say Never Tour’ coming to San Diego,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://fox5sandiego.com/entertainment/peter-framptons-never-ever-say-never-tour-coming-to-san-diego/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vZm94NXNhbmRpZWdvLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3BldGVyLWZyYW1wdG9ucy1uZXZlci1ldmVyLXNheS1uZXZlci10b3VyLWNvbWluZy10by1zYW4tZGllZ28v0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3g1c2FuZGllZ28uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvcGV0ZXItZnJhbXB0b25zLW5ldmVyLWV2ZXItc2F5LW5ldmVyLXRvdXItY29taW5nLXRvLXNhbi1kaWVnby9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

On May 12 the Moana actor shared a Mother's Day tribute to his wife Lauren Hashian alongside a video of the pair singing excerpts from two Sam Cooke tracks: ""Bring It On Home to Me"" and ""Nothin' Can Change This Love.""

""One human here is illuminated today on Mother’s Day because she is blessed from the heavens above with kindness empathy compassion beauty and an abundance of musical talents that can only be God given with the voice and harmonies of an angel — all while being the greatest mama in the world to our babies"" began Johnson 52.

""The other human here ruins songs by making up vulgar lyrics followed by a very sinful laugh while confidently singing in keys that don’t exist — and upon being questioned about song structure he’ll simply insist 'We make up the rules'"" he joked. ""And I’m quite sure there’s tequila in his energy drink can.""



""Happy Mother’s Day @laurenhashianofficial. Mimi & Aja too. #playitagainSAM 🥃"" Johnson concluded.

Johnson and Hashian began dating in 2007 and later welcomed daughters Jasmine 8 and Tiana 6 before going on to tie the knot in 2019. (The Jungle Cruise actor is also dad to 22-year-old daughter Simone Johnson with ex-wife Dany Garcia.)

Hashian who is a musician previously showed off her vocal talents last Thanksgiving when she joined Johnson and musician Eric Zayne for a little session at the piano.

In a clip shared by Johnson on Instagram Zayne played the piano as Hashian sat on a chair next to him and they both belted out the lyrics to Billy Joel's ""Just the Way You Are"" with the actor joining in as he leaned over the top of the grand instrument.

""A lil’ Thanksgiving tickling of the ivorys with the two beautiful voices and talents of @laurenhashianofficial & @ericzayne and me just making up lyrics to an all time classic @billyjoel"" Johnson wrote.



Hashian is equally fond of her ""amazing man"" having posted a sweet tribute to the actor earlier this month in honor of his birthday alongside a photo of Johnson holding their girls.

""I do not want to let this birthday go by without saying the gratitude I feel to spend each birthday with you just gets more special and more sentimental every year … to have so many years under our belts"" she began. ""And yet also feel so many new things are just beginning in our lives especially as our little girls are just taking this world by the reigns and making each day so FULL of Life! Discovery! Laughter! And Love!""

Hashian went on to thank Johnson ""for the endless blessings you bring to our world"" as well as for being their family's ""leader"" for his ""love"" for his ""desire for growth"" for his ""inspiration"" and for his ""big strong hugs.""

""Thank you for how you root us give us a beautiful foundation to stand on and keep us safe and warm in your energetic embrace. I LOVE YOU YSHSOAG! The day you were born is a true celebration!!! WE LOVE YOU!!!"" she concluded.

COLORADO SPRINGS Co. -- Downhill skier Breezy Johnson has been banned for 14 months for three violations of anti-doping rules and can't race until December.

The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency published its decision late Monday for Johnson’s failure to comply with the whereabouts rules. They oblige athletes to detail where they can be found for one hour each day to give a sample with no advance notice.

Athletes have been banned for up to two years if they have three violations in a 12-month period such as missed tests or failures to update accurate details of their location.

Johnson’s whereabouts failures were on Oct. 29 2022 then June 13 2023 and Oct. 10 2023 USADA said. A seven-time podium finisher in World Cup races she left the circuit in December while under investigation.

USADA said 14 months was an appropriate ban for the 28-year-old Johnson because her “degree of fault was relatively low given the circumstances of the case.”

Johnson did not race in the World Cup last season and is not scheduled to miss any races next season in her specialist downhill and super-G events before the ban expires on Dec. 9.

The USADA ruling can be challenged by the World Anti-Doping Agency and the International Ski and Snowboard Federation on appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

Johnson’s race career peaked in a one-year period through December 2021 when she had three runner-up finishes and four third-places in World Cup downhills.

She missed the 2022 Beijing Olympics due to a knee injury she picked up three weeks before the games.

The fine follows an inspector general investigation and a November probable cause finding from the board which Conyears-Ervin was given the opportunity to rebut in the interim. In line with ethics board policy Conyears-Ervin was not named.

“We have engaged in this process with seriousness and good faith and are disappointed in today’s action” Conyears-Ervin spokesman Brian Berg said in a written statement. “We are evaluating all options available to us and remain confident that a fuller airing of the validity of these years old allegations and questionable actions of investigators will paint a fuller picture — and we look forward to that day. Until then we will continue to respect what is supposed to be a confidential process.”

Monday’s fine comes on the heels of a separate $60000 penalty levied against the treasurer by the same board last month. They found on “multiple occasions” Conyears-Ervin violated her fiduciary duty made unauthorized uses of city property and conducted prohibited political activities according to a board summary.

The Tribune first reported on allegations made by former aides Tiffany Harper and Ashley Evans who said they were retaliated against and ultimately fired after reporting the misconduct. Former Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration paid out a $100000 settlement to the two then fought for roughly two years to conceal the details of their whistleblower complaint.

Mayor Brandon Johnson released that information after taking office.

Separately Chicago ethics leaders on Monday criticized Johnson for failing to fill vacancies on the city’s ethics board and an “abrupt” pullback from plans to tighten rules for contractors and candidates for city office.

William Conlon the typically amiable chair of the seven-member Board of Ethics criticized Johnson’s slow pace to fill two vacant spots on the board which have been empty since July 2022 and March 2023.

Two other members’ terms will expire this summer. If those four positions aren’t filled before the end of July the board will not have enough members to legally meet.

“As you can tell we are still down two members a task that can’t be that difficult” Conlon said during Monday’s board meeting. “We have two members whose terms are set to expire at the end of July. Two clear-thinking independent thoughtful people who do their homework and are here participating every time. Why they have not been reappointed baffles me.”

Johnson spokesman Ronnie Reese said three candidates will be submitted for those board vacancies this month “with approval anticipated at the June City Council meeting.”

Steve Berlin the board’s longtime executive director added that he was “sad to report” there were “no current plans to hold a committee meeting or ethics committee hearing on the proposed amendments” to the city’s ethics ordinance.

Though ethics changes were legislative hallmarks of the early months of Johnson’s two predecessors the mayor has not embraced any new changes to the city’s oversight rules. Without mayoral support such changes typically wither on the vine in the City Council.

“I know that Ald. (Matt) Martin is disappointed in this as well” Berlin said.

Martin 47th chair of the City Council Committee on Ethics and Government Oversight took up the board’s proposed changes and said they would be a priority for passage this spring. Instead the committee has canceled two scheduled meetings in recent months.

Martin told the Tribune he was “frustrated” about the board vacancies and confirmed there was no timeline to take up ethics reform.

“I don’t think that we’re yet in a place where there’s alignment across the committee and the mayor’s office” regarding ethics ordinance amendments Martin said declining to comment on the misalignment. “So we’ll continue to work on that but I don’t have a timeline for when we might be able to take those up.”

The mayor’s office did not comment on the amendments.

The board’s proposed changes — spurred in part by Tribune reporting — include barring contractors who work for aldermen from getting involved in any city decisions that benefit their own financial interests or that benefit other clients or employers.

The changes would also “make clear that no candidate or political fundraising committee may for example send emails soliciting political contributions or campaign work to city employees or officials to their official city email addresses” a response to Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s mayoral campaign sending emails to Chicago Public Schools staff seeking student interns.

Earlier this year Johnson described those proposed reforms as “a positive step toward a more accountable city government” but did not otherwise comment on his ethics priorities.

During Monday’s ethics board meeting Bryan Zarou policy chief for the Better Government Association said there was an “abrupt” and “troubling” pullback of mayoral support from the ethics amendment ordinance and he had not received a clear explanation why.

Conlon described that as an “unfortunate surprise.”

In the meantime Martin said his committee would hold hearings on inspector general findings and audits and potentially codify an old executive order banning lobbyists from donating to the mayor.

Four registered lobbyists were initially dinged by the board for donating to Johnson’s campaign. That violated a 2011 executive order signed by former Mayor Rahm Emanuel barring such donations.

The board found though it had no authority to enforce the order nor did the city’s inspector general have power to formally investigate potential violations. The board dismissed the cases against those lobbyists.

While Johnson returned the donations and his campaign said the policy was “sound and necessary” he said last month that codifying the rule is not something he’s “spent a lot of time thinking about” according to WBEZ and that he would “take another look at it.”

(Mikey Williams/Top Rank)

The announcer at RAC Arena was not having a good day on Sunday.

The scene was reminiscent of when Steve Harvey crowned the wrong Miss Universe in 2015 or of the “Moonlight” debacle at the Oscars in 2017. It was rough.

Cherneka Johnson beat reigning WBA bantamweight champion Nina Hughes on Sunday in Perth Australia via a majority decision. But when ring announcer Dan Hennessey a former United States Marine stepped up to announce her as the winner he completely butchered the delivery. That made for a very confusing scene in the ring.

Hennessey misread the scorecards when making his announcement and he accidentally declared Hughes the winner. Suddenly it was her arm in the air and the 41-year-old started celebrating.

Pretty quickly though he corrected his mistake as if nothing had happened. He read the scores again apparently correct the second time and Johnson's arm was lifted in the air. That left Hughes and the announcers on the broadcast incredibly confused.

Just watch the scene unfold:

Watch this whole sequence. Never seen this. pic.twitter.com/EpsQkS7JRA — Ariel Helwani (@arielhelwani) May 12 2024

ESPN’s Joe Tessitore erupted on the “absolute clown show garbage amateur hour” announcing from Hennessey too while trying to explain to viewers in the U.S. what had actually happened.

The error wasn’t Hennesseey’s only one of the night either. He messed up the scorecards for the Pedro Guevara-Andrew Moloney fight earlier in the night too. The problem for him is apparently nothing new.

Even though she was briefly robbed of the celebration and just about everyone involved was confused Johnson got her win. In theory that's all that really matters."

India has set itself a target to achieve net zero by 2070.

The company is also witnessing strong demand from the data centre sector in India as its solutions and services are helping building owners lower the total cost of ownership.

“India is a very important market for us. India now has the world’s largest population fifth largest economy fastest growing large economy as well as having the largest working age population and so on it is extremely important for us at the Asia Pacific level as well as at a global level” Anu Rathninde president – APAC Johnson Controls told Business Standard.

“There is massive growth in the data centre space now and we are very well positioned to support that” he said.

Rathninde said that emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and generative AI can and should be leveraged to reduce carbon footprint.

“But like with any new technology these are areas that we need to optimise and get to know better and so on…there are regulations to come and there are additional safety protocols we need to follow as we move forward. But there is a definite need to embrace these technologies and use them to their benefit” he said.

Over the last 2-3 years the company has invested significantly in India launching two Innovation Centres in Hyderabad and Bengaluru and hiring across verticals. It has over 8000 employees in India out of its total workforce of about 100000.

The company - which competes with the likes of Siemens Schneider Electric and Honeywell - has maintained that these centres are developed with a view to not only build solutions for India but for the global market. Currently Johnson Controls has three research and development (R&D) centres three engineering centres and three manufacturing plants in India.

The technical requirements from the Indian customers are very high said Rathninde. “Historically the requirements were not that high. Now Indian customers demand the highest-end technologies. They want to have access to cutting-edge building technologies. This is a major shift we are seeing over the last five years or so. The customers’ demand for high-end technology is in turn going to help us increase our offerings and develop more technologies catered for India” he said.

The company is seeing a demand for its solutions across industries such as education hospitals and healthcare pharmaceutical new energy petrochemical and manufacturing said Rathninde.

While the Paris Agreement has accelerated clients’ sustainability agenda Rathninde believes it is much more than that.

“Business leaders are realising that if you are a sustainability-focused and ESG-focussed company you are way ahead in the game in terms of positioning yourself as a great company that ultimately has multiple benefits. Your business is going to be economically sustainable because you are doing the right thing. You are on the right track and it can last. Your customers like to buy your products because you are doing the right thing and running the business responsibly. And employees like to work for such companies” he said.

The M series will be launched in the T-CAP versions of 9 12 and 16kW three-phase with single-phase models in 9 and 12 kW being made available later next year.

T-CAP is Panasonic’s term for total capacity – outdoor units that can maintain heating capacity down to outdoor temperatures of -20°C and can work down to -28°C.

The M Series offers a maximum water outlet temperature of 75°C at -10°C outside temperature and the ability to supply 55°C hot water at -25°C outside temperature.

This makes it ideal for retrofit projects and renovations requiring high water temperatures for radiators. Additionally it can achieve a domestic hot water stored temperature of up to 65°C or carry out a sterilisation cycle without the need of direct electric heater.

Thanks to its new modular concept the M Series allows for more application choices offering different indoor units available in All-in-One and Bi-Bloc.

Panasonic’s Bi-Bloc system generates hot water from an internal hydro module connected to an outdoor unit. Its all-in-one system has an outdoor unit with the hydro module and DHW cylinder all in one cabinet indoors.

The new M series features a new injection compressor and achieves an SCOP of up to 5.

New to the M series the outdoor unit can function as a standalone system with just an indoor remote control or homeowners can opt for enhanced functionality by incorporating the more advanced control box.

The M Series features an enhanced design with an anti-vibration structure redesigned chassis and optimised fan speed to reduce noise levels. The units are said to be able to maintain a low ErP sound value of a minimum of 53dB(A) which can be reduced even more in super quiet mode.

Panasonic",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vdW5oZXJkLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEyL25pZ2VsLWZhcmFnZXMtcGxhbi1mb3ItcG93ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nigel Farage's plan for power Reform UK wants to crush the Tories,"It is certainly set up like a start-up. While the exact details of who owns what percentages of Reform UK remain veiled in secrecy according to one inside figure who knows the breakdown it is simple enough. In total there are 15 shares of which Farage owns eight Tice five Oakden one and the party secretary Mehrtash a’Zami one. According to Companies House this makes Farage — officially — a person with “significant control” over the company which they define as having “the right directly or indirectly to appoint or remove a majority of the board of directors”.

Farage’s control has become a source of some internal unrest. Since he stepped down as leader last year he has come under pressure to give up some of his shares as part of wider moves to democratise the organisation. Members of the party currently pay £25 to join and will in future get to vote in leadership elections should there be any. So far though Farage has refused to give up his shares. “We each wanted a share but Nigel refused” said one party insider. And for good reason from Farage’s point of view. As things stand Farage owns a company whose stock is rising without having to put any of his own money on the line. It’s a win-win.

It is Tice not Farage who has kept Reform UK afloat since Brexit bankrolling the party to the tune of £1 million of his own money. The party is also receiving donations from businessmen such as the former Conservative Party donor Jeremy Hosking and the multimillionaire owner of the property company Panther Securities Andrew Perloff. According to some inside Reform UK Tice’s loan acts as a kind of insurance against Farage’s power. If — for whatever reason — Tice and Farage were to fall out and Farage returned in some sort of reconquista the party would still owe Tice the money. How much this would ever bind Farage in practice is open to question. He could presumably raise such a sum in donations — or if forced simply declare the company insolvent and move on.

In practice the party is majority-owned by Farage but run by a kind of oligarchy of Eurosceptics under the congenial leadership of Tice the CEO who has built up a large equity stake in the business himself. And this current structure is not sustainable. “We do have to democratise” Widdecombe said. “There’s no doubt about that but we can’t be navel-gazing now before the election. We are structured as a company. After the election we should change that to become a party.” For now though Farage is like some kind of hands-off chairman promoting the party’s interests — or perhaps his own — on GB News and I’m A Celebrity ultimately able to remove Tice but with no reason to do so as the party keeps growing.

So far the partnership between Tice and Farage has worked well. The pair speak regularly and share the same political instincts: hard-line anti-woke Eurosceptic conservatism. Both were members of the Conservative Party who now loathe it. While Farage is in the Jungle Tice has stood in for him on his show on GB News. There is no tension between the pair that I detected in my conversations.

Yet it is possible to detect a faint grumbling about Farage’s power within the wider party. There are many for example who believe it was a fundamental error to give up “The Brexit Party” for “Reform UK”. The Brexit Party was a successful established brand with national name recognition. Reform UK has had to start from scratch and with a name that could just as easily be a progressive think tank as a conservative political party. “If we had our time again would we change the name?” reflected Tice. “Perhaps not.” To partially unwind this decision the logo that appears on people’s voting cards will now read: “Reform UK: The Brexit Party.”

The tension over the name is not just a question of branding but also of political judgement. In essence by standing down his candidates in 2019 and changing the party’s name Farage was accepting the Conservative argument that Brexit had been delivered. For some of the hardliners in the party leadership this was a fundamental strategic mistake. Brexit to these figures has not only been half enacted because Northern Ireland remains tied to EU law but also badly enacted with the trade deal that replaced the previous relationship. By standing down in those 317 seats the party dipped its hands in the Brexit blood leaving it unable to make political capital out of people’s frustrations with how things have worked out since. “We said we were going to change politics for good” said Ben Habib “but we embedded the old political system.”

Tice is known to be sympathetic to this argument but insists Farage’s decision was necessary. “We had to stand down to make sure Brexit was done legally” he told me “even if it has not been done properly.” But given the sentiment in the party Tice has promised his leading generals that he will not replicate Farage’s decision at the next election and has committed to standing a Reform UK candidate in every seat in Britain — though not ironically in Northern Ireland.

Essentially Farage is criticised for being too soft — and now he’s being too soft on the Conservative Party. He was not sufficiently Eurosceptic unionist or strategic. Ultimately he was lazy and missed his chance. Now instead of leading an insurgent political force opposed to open borders and Net Zero Farage is messing around in Australia and flirting with the idea of becoming a Tory prime minister.

So are the Tories worried? Among senior Tory strategists there is palpable relief that they are facing Reform UK not a still-angry Farage-led Brexit Party. “They have two big problems” one senior Tory explained to me. “They don’t have Farage and they don’t have an obvious mission.” And yet there remains a real concern among the Tory hierarchy that a combination of immigration and Net Zero could light a fire under Reform turbo-charging its support. Tice for what it’s worth now believes the next election will be a straightforward “immigration election” the perfect terrain for his party to outperform expectations.

One obvious problem for Reform UK is that according to the pollsters and party strategists I have spoken with over the past few weeks the party’s support base largely comes from disaffected former Conservative voters. It is as one Conservative strategist put it to me “a hardcore Conservative Party”. In many respects Tice perfectly reflects the party that exists today: he is a wealthy no-nonsense Tesla-driving businessman who applied to be the Tories’ London mayoral candidate as recently as 2018 and hates what his old party has become. He is for low taxes a small state stopping the boats cutting immigration; and against wokeism gender ideology and Net Zero.

This indeed is what Reform UK supporters believe in — and what Ukip voters believed in. As such it is no surprise that the party saw its first big surge in membership when Jeremy Hunt was brought in as chancellor at the height of the Truss crisis last year. It then saw a fresh batch of members join up when Sunak became Prime Minister. The return of Cameron to the government then saw a fresh surge with 1200 new members signing up in four days according to Tice. But is it popular beyond the fringes of the Conservative Party?

There is no doubt its rise in the polls is impressive. Much of this can be attributed to the collapse in support for the Tories. In April 2020 at the height of the first lockdown the Conservative Party hit its highest poll rating in decades: 53%. Today under Sunak his party has seen its support halve to 25% at best — or as low as 19% according to some pollsters. The problem for Tice is that because his base is made up of disaffected hardliner conservatives they are even more opposed to a Labour government than floating centrist voters and so — leading Tories believe — are most susceptible to eventually backing the Conservatives in a general election. Many of the electoral strategists I spoke to believed Reform UK will in the end be lucky to get more than 3% in the general election.

The first danger for Reform UK over the next 12 months therefore is that they will be squeezed as Labour and the Tories battle it out for the swing voters who hold the key to power. For while an increase in support for Reform UK could be damaging for the Conservatives it is not existential in the way Labour’s current 20-point lead threatens to be. To put it simply every voter who switches from Tory to Labour is twice as damaging to Sunak’s chances of holding onto power as a Conservative voter who backs Reform UK. The second danger is that Farage loses interest. While his time in the jungle has certainly not damaged his public reputation — so far at least — it has not yet enhanced it in any meaningful sense. From the beginning there was a sense that his motivation was a little too obvious a little too cynical. “I was a bit gutted” he admitted when he wasn’t chosen to take part in the bushtucker challenges. “You see if you do the challenges it’s 25% of the air time. I’m looking at reaching a whole new audience.”

The comment was authentic Farage. From the moment he broke into the national consciousness following his election to the European Parliament in 1999 he has been focused on the battle for “air time”. He was in a sense Britain’s first social media politician going viral with his extraordinary attack on Tony Blair in Strasbourg as far back as 2005. When it comes to the great electoral battles of 2024 he may well prefer the glamour of being Donald Trump’s wingman. The final obvious challenge for Reform UK is that it is both too optimistic and too reliant on the prospect of electoral reform. Tice is convinced that it is now only a matter of time before some form of proportional representation is brought in by a Labour-led government. But unless the Labour Party falls short of a majority it seems implausible that Keir Starmer will legislate to make it harder for him to win a majority.

These are the principal challenges facing Reform UK none of which means they should be discounted as a long-term presence in British politics. In 1997 both Jimmy Goldsmith’s Referendum Party and Alan Sked’s Ukip were swept away in the tsunami of support for Blair’s New Labour and its promise to lead Britain back into the centre of European affairs. Seven years later Ukip secured more than two and a half million votes in the European elections.

The abject failure of the British state to ever change anything is the key opportunity for Reform. As of today there is little sign that either of the main political parties has any idea how to significantly reduce net migration “stop the boats” or improve living standards. For so long as this is the case the conditions will exist for a party offering alternative solutions. Add to this the increasing political salience of Net Zero across all European countries and it is foolhardy to rule out a genuinely popular anti-establishment insurgency emerging. As one Tory strategist put it to me: “If the institutions keep failing people will ask what is the fucking point in the politicians in charge?”

These are the political challenges and opportunities for Reform UK. But underneath it lies a structural challenge: is it a political movement to deny a certain brand of Toryism power or a vehicle for a man who is still flirting with the idea of taking over the Tory party itself? For Tice Widdecombe and others this overstates the problem — we in the media are just falling for Farage’s games. “He will not rejoin the Conservative Party” Widdecombe told me. “I cannot see what he possibly has to gain from it. It’s cloud cuckoo land.”

And yet what if Faragism took over the Tory Party without Farage? It is not at all clear from my discussions with insiders what difference there is between Reform UK and a Suella Braverman-led Conservative Party. “If the Conservative Party do lose the next election there’s a chance we could have a proper Conservative Party and there be a merging of ideas that takes place” Widdecombe told me. “The problem with Suella is that I agree with everything she says but nothing happens.”

In the end as the ultimate controller of the party much rests on Farage himself. In his heart does he dream of being a true Tory prime minister the prince over the water who returns home in triumph? Or does he just love the drama — the airtime? Ultimately if there is ever a clash between Farage’s ambition and that of his party it is Farage who will have the final say. “Nigel is a terrific maverick” Habib told me. “Ultimately we cannot know what he will decide in the future.” And that is the point. It’s still Nigel’s game we’re playing."
JPM,JPMorgan Chase,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJyb3duZGFpbHloZXJhbGQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAyMy8xMi9jbGltYXRlLWFjdGl2aXN0cy1kZW1hbmQtY2hhc2UtYmFuay1ib3ljb3R0LWRpdmVzdG1lbnQtZnJvbS1mb3NzaWwtZnVlbHPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Climate activists demand Chase Bank boycott divestment from fossil fuels,"The 2023 Banking on Climate Chaos report claims that Chase has contributed over $434 billion to the fossil fuels industry.

On Saturday morning around 11 a.m. roughly 30 community members joined organizers from Climate Action Rhode Island — a local affiliate of the international 350.org climate movement — to protest at JPMorgan Chase Bank in Barrington. The protestors demanded that Chase divest from the fossil fuels industry and urged passersby to boycott the bank until it does so.

The demonstration lasted until 1 p.m. with protestors holding signs that read “Stop Chase The Toxic Bank” “Stop Funding Fossil Fuels” “Boycott Chase Bank” and “Chase Bank Climate Change Profiteer” with an illustration of oil flowing from the bank’s logo. Signs also encouraged passing cars to honk in support of the protest.

Brian Wilder an organizer with CARI led the crowd in chants shouting “No more gas no more oil keep your poison in the soil.”

Protestors also distributed informational pamphlets detailing Chase’s investment in fossil fuels to passing vehicles.

Calling for a community boycott of Chase Bank demonstrators distributed email templates for withdrawing funds and closing accounts with the bank. The email templates included demands for banks to “change to green energy sources.”

A few minutes into the protest an unidentified community member approached the demonstration shouting “Kids are dying in Gaza” and holding a sign that read “Save” with several children and the Palestinian flag drawn on it. The protester blocked the intersection for several minutes obstructing traffic. They also engaged in a verbal altercation with a CARI organizer and later left the scene.

The Herald could not reach the community member for comment.

Barrington Police arrived on the scene at 11:11 a.m. in response to multiple calls regarding traffic obstruction. The community member had already left the intersection.

The officers told protesters that Chase Bank employees requested they remove signs and materials from Chase’s property and remove cars from the bank’s parking lot on Maple Avenue.

Police officers also advised the climate protestors to remain on the sidewalk to avoid disrupting traffic. The officers left after about 20 minutes.

In an email to The Herald JPMorgan Chase Spokesperson Briana Curran wrote “Chase is glad to serve consumer and business customers in Barrington and all around Rhode Island.” Employees at the Barrington Chase Bank declined to comment on the protest.

“Through our branches we hire locally invest in the local economy and give back by volunteering in the community listening and addressing the needs of Barrington” Curran added.

Elizabeth O’Connell a protest organizer and CARI member said the organization is “focusing on Chase Bank for the next year.”

“We would like to do one (protest) a month in 2024 targeting all the Chase Banks in Rhode Island” she said.

Saturday’s protest follows previous CARI demonstrations against the bank. In September 2021 CARI organizers staged a similar protest on Thayer Street demanding Chase’s divestment and urging passersby to boycott the bank The Herald previously reported.

O’Connell noted the increase in Chase Bank branches in the state saying that “up until two years ago they had very few branches in Rhode Island.” JPMorgan Chase opened its first Rhode Island branch in 2019 and there are now 21 active Chase locations in the state according to the company’s website.

“Since the 2015 climate accords Chase Bank has invested over $300 billion in fossil fuel project funding” CARI organizer David Brunetti said citing the 2022 Banking on Climate Chaos report.

The report details JPMorgan Chase’s financial contributions as well as other major banks. In 2022 Chase’s contributions to the fossil fuel industry were the highest out of all major banks followed by CITI and Wells Fargo at $382 billion.

Chase’s contributions have now grown to over $434 billion according to the updated 2023 report.

“What we want them to do is to instead of investing in fossil fuel projects put more of that money or all that money (into) renewables” Brunetti added.

Brunetti also urged community members to boycott Chase and open accounts at banks and credit unions approved by websites like Bank.Green.

Curran defended JPMorgan Chase’s sustainability goals stating that Chase provides “financing all across the energy sector: supporting energy security helping clients accelerate their low carbon transitions and increasing clean energy financing with a target of $1 trillion for green initiatives by 2030.”

Brunetti noted the event’s alignment with COP28 an international climate conference centered on multilateral solutions to climate change. The conference held in Dubai began on Thursday.

“All we can do is try to locally regionally nationally and internationally work with groups to continue to bring attention to the worst offenders” Brunetti said.

Local high schooler Amity Burock said: “I’m here because we only have a certain number of years and months before the world has no point of return.”

“We can do anything we can to change that even just protesting” Burock added. “If enough people see they’ll start to change and that’s what we really need.”

Protest attendee Camille Nixon said she was at the protest because she feared the impact of climate change on future generations. “I don’t want to kick the can down the path” she said. “We are responsible. It’s not anybody else.”

“Realistically will Chase change their policies because a bunch of kooky people are standing in front of their bank waving signs? I don’t know” said CARI member Will Nakshian. “Does it make a difference? Well you have to try.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL2RhaWx5aG9kbC5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8wMy9qcG1vcmdhbi1jaGFzZS1jZW8td2FybnMtZXhwbG9zaXZlLWV2ZW50LW1heS1iZS1pbmNvbWluZy1hbWlkLWRhbmdlcm91cy1jb2NrdGFpbC1vZi1yaXNrcy1mYWNpbmctZWNvbm9teS_SAY4BaHR0cHM6Ly9kYWlseWhvZGwuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMDMvanBtb3JnYW4tY2hhc2UtY2VvLXdhcm5zLWV4cGxvc2l2ZS1ldmVudC1tYXktYmUtaW5jb21pbmctYW1pZC1kYW5nZXJvdXMtY29ja3RhaWwtb2Ytcmlza3MtZmFjaW5nLWVjb25vbXkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,JPMorgan Chase CEO Warns ‘Explosive’ Event May Be Incoming Amid Dangerous Cocktail of Risks Facing Economy,"The CEO of the world’s largest bank says the US is now facing a slew of risks that could push the global economy into rough waters.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says the US economy is addicted to debt and central bank spending has become like heroin to American households the Telegraph reports.

Dimon believes the economy is essentially a “dangerous cocktail” of risks and an “explosive” economic event may be on the horizon.

The CEO says the trillions of dollars worth of free money handed out during the pandemic and the additional trillions printed by the US government will prove to be problematic for the economy adding that the “money is like heroin.”

“And of course when you put $5 trillion in the hands of consumers … think of those as drugs in the system …Well of course you’d feel pretty good. Of course stock markets are high and of course companies are earning more money.”

While some investors are expecting a cool-off of inflation and an easing of rates Dimon warns that “inflationary forces” may prove to be stickier than originally thought leading to more problems.

“We’re on this sugar high and I’m not saying this ends in a depression [but] I think there’s more inflationary forces out there…

There’s a higher chance that rates go higher inflation doesn’t go away and all these things cause more problems of some sort.”

When the global economy is inevitably forced to return to an environment where it isn’t being propped up by government spending and easier monetary conditions Dimon says that companies could see “big drops in profit.”

Along with the economic uncertainty facing the US Dimon says current geopolitical tension may act as the spark that ignites something much bigger in markets. While he doesn’t want to be pessimistic Dimon says he’s leaning toward the expectation that things get worse in the Middle East.

“You can’t sit here and say that something bad may not happen. I’m not trying to scare people I’m more in the category that something could go wrong.”

If you want to skip our introduction to the world's biggest bank in terms of assets its latest performance and other details then check out JP Morgan's Top 5 Stock Picks for 2023.

JPMorgan is a banking giant. According to Insider Monkey's research the bank had $3.74 trillion in total assets as of June 2023 which made it the biggest private bank in the world. Not a small achievement JPMorgan's presence spans all over the world and particularly America and its retail and investment banking divisions are divided across two arms. Chase Bank is the retail division of JPMorgan and its corporate investment banking and wealth management divisions for the super rich are managed through J.P. Morgan.

When compared to some other banks such as the embattled The Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE:GS) JPMorgan has had a rock star of a year in 2023 financially. Its shares trading under JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) are up by a respectable 13% year to date which significantly outpaces the S&P Banks Select Industry Index's -11.99% returns year to date. So why is JPMorgan the star of the banking industry in 2023? Well for starters it has been posting solid earnings which are perhaps one of the biggest catalysts to a company's share price. JPMorgan's third quarter financials revealed that the bank's revenue grew by 22% annually to sit at $39.9 billion and its profits posted a 35% annual growth to sit at $13.2 billion. At the heart of its revenue growth are the record high interest rates in the U.S. right now with JPMorgan's net interest income beating analyst estimates during the quarter to touch a sizeable $22.9 billion.

A dominating presence in the financial industry also provides JPMorgan employees with a unique insight into the corporate world. The bank's analysts regularly cover thousands of stocks to assign them ratings and share price targets. We've been regular followers of JPMorgan here at Insider Monkey as well and as 2023 kicked off we took a look at JPMorgan’s Best Performing 15 Stock Picks for 2023. This showed that the top five performing stocks back then were Peloton Interactive Inc. (NASDAQ:PTON) Spotify Technology S.A. (NYSE:SPOT) Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Wizz Air Holdings Plc (LON:WIZZ.L) and ChargePoint Holdings Inc. (NYSE:CHPT). So the next thing to ask when evaluating just how good the analysts at JPMorgan are is how the shares performed as 2023 bids us farewell.

Story continues

Well the year to date share price performance of the five companies is -32% 114.96% 168.59% -1% and -77.78%. This shows that when it comes to stocks at least when we limit our attention to only five companies then JPMorgan's top stock picks can deliver outstanding triple digit percentage returns and yet also drop considerably. On a side note this is also a perfect example of why portfolio diversification is also recommended as it helps investors limit the impact of one stock on their portfolios.

Shifting gears JPMorgan's CEO Jamie Dimon who's also often rumored to be running for President has been at the center of a lot of media coverage as of late. This is because Mr. Dimon announced through JPMorgan that he would sell his shares for the first time since he took over the reins in 2005. The JPMorgan boss owned 8.6 million shares as of October 2023 - the date of the announcement - and using JPMorgan's current share price of $152.82 shows that he's worth a cool $1.3 billion. Running the biggest bank in the world comes with its own set of perks and privileges and being a billionaire is one of them.

The tail end of 2024 has also created some hope in the stock market that high rates might start to come down soon. High rates also affect investment banking and if you're wondering what JPMorgan is seeing in this area then here's what the firm's chief financial officer Mr. Jeremy Barnum had to say during its latest earnings call:

I mean as you know obviously the current levels in Investment Banking remain quite depressed certainly relative to the very elevated levels that we saw during the pandemic but even relative to sort of 2019 which is what you might consider the last normal year. We do eventually think we'll recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels recognizing that by the time it happens you will have had many years of economic growth in the meantime. And to be fair while the current environment is a little bit complicated in mix and there are some headwinds as you pointed out things have improved a little bit. And I think I would say our banking team is a little bit more optimistic than they were last quarter. So it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum but obviously significant uncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds given lower levels of announced M&A and some regulatory headwinds on that side.

So as cautious optimism starts to make its way at JPMorgan we took a look at its top stock picks with some notable names being Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).

In this interview he discusses the Altman incident what’s at stake in the AI race and how investors can identify instigators of change. Video / NZ Herald

The billionaire first investor in OpenAI says New Zealand should not regulate revolutionary technology like ChatGPT because the potential economic benefits far outweigh the risks.

Vinod Khosla founder of venture capital firm Khosla Ventures believes up to 80 per cent of all jobs including doctors lawyers and teachers will be replaced by artificial intelligence.

“We will be able to provide a basic level of services to everybody in every country” Khosla told Markets with Madison from San Francisco.

“The need to work will disappear. It will be hugely empowering and freeing for society. Kids won’t be taught at age 12 ‘you need to get a job’. It’ll be like ‘hey discover your passion and follow it’.”

Billionaire venture capital investor Vinod Khosla invested US$50m in OpenAI in 2019. He publicly backed ousted CEO Sam Altman to return last month.

However the OpenAI incident that saw its chief executive Sam Altman ousted only to return within days after employee backlash highlighted a risk-focused mindset that could get in the way.

Khosla calls it effective altrusim (EA) enacted by “rogue board members”.

“They personally didn’t like Sam. There’s nothing high-minded about what they did.

“There’s people in their ivory towers speculating about this. They have nothing to lose. They’re mostly in this I’ll call it mental masturbation business.”

“They forget there’s three billion people who can’t access primary care or education for their children or access to justice all of which would be enabled with a strong AI.”

Khosla invested US$50 million into OpenAI in 2019 - a cheque twice the size of any initial investment he’s made before.

He said the “sci-fi story” of AI destroying humanity was amplified by the press.

In his mind the biggest danger to be discussed was China getting ahead of the West in the AI race.

“I believe China can win this race. I believe the West can win this race. It’s up for grabs.

“If they get to them [benefits] first then we are up sh*t creek.”

He warned investors about Apple Google and Tesla’s supply chain links to China and the risk of “corporate capture” aka regulatory capture.

“The CCP there influences businesses not the other way around.”

While he believed AI would enable a “Utopian future” he noted it needed to be applied with “care and deep empathy” something he thought the renewed OpenAI board was capable of.

Khosla is the founder of American IT company Sun Microsystems now owned by Oracle.

When he turned to venture capital investment he made his employer a 2500x return on an early investment in router manufacturer Juniper Networks.

In 2004 he started Khosla Ventures which was the first VC investor in Jack Dorsey’s payments technology company Square (now called Block) and has invested in three New Zealand-founded companies - Rocket Lab Lanzatech and Leaft.

Schweppe's may have created the first carbonated mineral water in 1783 but it would be another 80 years before companies began adding other flavors to the fizzy concoction. After Vernor's Ginger Ale was produced in the 1860s other soda companies began creating their own new and unique flavors. For many people it comes down to Pepsi vs. Coke but if you look at all the different regional sodas it becomes much more complex. The rest of the country may not know what Moxie soda is but New Englanders love it. The same goes for Texas-based Big Red.

While many Texans would love to make Big Red the state's national drink even those who love it have trouble explaining the flavor. On a Reddit thread the suggestions are all over the place. ""If you took cinnamon flavored gum and mixed it with cotton candy then diluted it"" suggested one fan. ""I agree with the bubble gum taste. I've heard some people say red vines"" said another.

Many people also assume that the red color is cherry or some sort of berry but it's just red dye. Big Red gets its flavor from the vanilla used in traditional cream soda mixed with citrus oils.

Originally It Was Only Sold In Texas

Big Red flavors - Facebook

Big Red was founded by Grover C. Thomsen and R.H. Roark in Waco Texas in 1937. Originally called Sun Tang Big Red Cream Soda it was shortened after hearing someone refer to it as 'Big Red.' Current flavors include the original Big Red Big Red Zero Sugar Big Blue Big Peach and Big Pineapple. It may not be as well-known as Coca-Cola Pepsi Dr Pepper or Mountain Dew but it's popular enough that it appears to have earned a copycat.

H-E-B Wild Red Soda may not be the brand name but as far as store-brand sodas go this knockoff has its fans. Slightly sweeter and with a more distinct cream soda taste it has won over some who prefer this drink over the original. ""Can't count the number of times someone has said 'Why is your Sprite so good' or 'I don't remember Big Red being so good'"" remarked one big fan on Reddit.

For decades Big Red was only sold in Texas but ever since Dr Pepper Snapple (which has since become Keurig Dr Pepper) bought a stake in the company in 2008 it broadened the distribution. This means Big Red has begun showing up in stores all around the country giving people the chance to decide for themselves exactly what it tastes like.

KEY,KeyCorp,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitwFodHRwczovL2J1ZmZhbG9uZXdzLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2VkaXRvcmlhbC90aGUtZWRpdG9yaWFsLWJvYXJkLWtleWJhbmstbXVzdC1vZmZlci1tb3JlLXRoYW4tcHJvbWlzZXMtdG8tYmxhY2stYW5kLWxvdy1pbmNvbWUtYm9ycm93ZXJzL2FydGljbGVfYTkyOTEwMjYtOGViOS0xMWVlLThiMzEtMmJmN2MxMWE0MTk4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KeyBank has not helped low-income and Black borrowers,"Whatever KeyBank is doing it needs to do better. After being accused of “systemic redlining” in late 2022 the bank has not improved its track record of home loans to Black and low-income borrowers. That’s according to the National Community Reinvestment Coalition which has acted as a watchdog to make sure that the bank fulfilled its promises to invest in underserved communities when it took over First Niagara Bank in 2016.

With Black borrowers representing only 2.6% of Key’s home purchase mortgage loans in 2022 progress looks minimal. This is disheartening and it lends credence though hardly needed to a recent report from New York Attorney General Letitia James that people of color are being denied the traditional American dream of homeownership at rates nearly as low as when racial discrimination in housing was legal. According to her report in New York 67% of white households own their homes compared with only 34% of households of color and in the Buffalo Niagara region 80% of white households own their homes compared with about 50% for households of color.

There may be more than one reason for such discrepancies but they are not surprising as banks still seem slow to increase their outreach and accessibility to Black would-be homeowners.

There were high hopes in 2016 when Key announced its National Community Benefits Plan a $16.5 billion loan and investment program that would touch every market Key serves in 15 states. Of that $5.8 billion was earmarked for markets served by both Key and First Niagara.

But in 2022 Jesse Van Tol president and CEO of the Washington D.C.-based Reinvestment Coalition had this to say: “KeyBank executives looked community groups in the eye and promised to become a leader on inclusive home mortgage lending then did the exact opposite.”

KeyBank says it has pumped the volume on its promises to communities. In May the $16.5 billion CBA was expanded to $40 billion. The bank also commissioned a racial equity audit by a law firm to help the bank advance its diversity equity and inclusion priorities.

But here we are in December and encouraging results have still not emerged. In fact the percentage of Black borrowers receiving home purchase loans has gone down significantly since 2018 when they represented 6.5% of such loans.

In her report which focused on the issue of mortgages without mentioning any specific lenders James suggested some remedies. They included subsidies for first-generation homeowners; more funding for community development financial institutions; and locally based “public banks” that would focus on underserved communities.

Key has adopted some similar strategies including grants of up to $5000 to homebuyers to buy eligible properties in majority-minority census tracts and/or to low- to moderate-income communities; and a Home Equity Loan program which provides discounted fixed rates for homeowners living in designated communities.

In addition as outlined by KeyBank Regional Communications Manager Matthew Pitts the bank has invested more than $1.2 billion in the Buffalo area since 2016 including mortgages to low-moderate income borrowers small business lending general philanthropy and affordable housing investments. True Bethel Commons in Niagara Falls and Elim Townhomes in Buffalo's Central Park neighborhood are high profile examples of KeyBank's help for more low-income housing in the region.

Key's official statement is that it “strongly disagrees with the National Community Reinvestment Coalition’s characterization of our lending activities” but a war of words is not the solution. There needs to be self-analysis; more hands-on work with communities; and new innovative programs sharply targeted toward getting Black and low-income mortgage-seekers into homes.

Mainly there have to be results. The promises made in 2016 need to be fulfilled.

She was born on October 16 1921 in Munising Michigan to William and Elizabeth (Hebert) LaFave. Ruth graduated from Sacred Heart School and is the last surviving member of the Wm. G. Mather Class of 1939. She briefly worked at Kimberly Clark and then Ruth served in the Women’s Army Corps as a medical technician during WWII.

Ruth returned to Munising and married John Carr in 1947 and together they raised their family. She was a lifetime member of Sacred Heart Church.

She was a very busy homemaker and enjoyed baking pickling and gardening. Ruth had a great love for the outdoors and enjoyed hunting fishing and especially berry picking. She once picked all around a patch of berries with a wasp’s nest in the center! On hot summer afternoons she could be found walking to the beach at Bay Furnace with a string of neighborhood children in tow. Ruth loved the UP and one of her favorite activities was driving around the county and exploring the woods with her husband John and later her children. She took good care of her health and loved to walk. Until her mobility declined she visited the beaches and boardwalks of Alger County frequently often in the company of a close friend. Ruth enjoyed playing games and cards with family and friends and continued to beat her opponents in cribbage up until her death.

She is survived by her children – Susan (Lee) Rosenbaum of Portland OR John (Trina) Carr of Christmas MI and Lori (Ken) Mitchell of Forest Grove OR; grandchildren – Rachel Rosenbaum (Dominic Brown) David Rosenbaum and Arthur (Paola) Oas; sister-in-law – Norma LaFave; and numerous nieces and nephews.

Musk wears the black hat well showing himself to have the most power and the least responsibility – and coming across like an intergalactic villain dropping lines like “let the chips fall where they may” as well as oddly disconnected phrases like “tell it to Earth” and “let’s see how Earth responds to that”.

He also seemingly cannot conceive that the latest and largest advertising boycott – itself a direct response to antisemitic conspiracy theories he endorsed on the platform – will in any way be seen as a result of his own erratic behaviour instead believing that ‘Earth’ will blame those companies who boycott X if the platform ceases to exist because of the fast-diminishing advertising revenue.

But right near the end of this twisting train of thought Tesla is brought up and — after correctly pointing out the electric car succeeded without advertising — he made the following mighty claim.

“Tesla currently sells twice as much in terms of electric vehicles than the rest of the electric car makers in the United States combined. Tesla’s done more to help the environment than all other companies combined.

“It would be fair to say therefore as a leader of the company I’ve done more for the environment than any single human on Earth.”

It’s a massive claim – and one you could take even further by arguing that Tesla accelerated the trend of electric vehicles so his impact goes beyond those direct sales alone. It is therefore arguably true. Elon Musk is Captain Planet.

Maybe he has done more for the environment than anyone in the entire galaxy!

When asked by Sorkin how he feels personally about this good he has done for the Earth — assumedly in an attempt to elicit some reply of boastful pride –- Musk makes his actual point.

“I’m saying what I care about is the reality of goodness not the perception of it.

“And what I see all over the place is people who care about looking good – while doing evil. F**k them.”

Quick drop the mic Elon!

Of course he doesn’t and he goes on to say a bunch of other less-incisive rabble. Also his maths is off in regards to the comparative EV sales in the US plus his claims of environmental glory conveniently sidestep the complicated issue of mass battery production and disposal lithium mining and all those Tesla factories that have to be built by pumping evil emissions into the sky.

Of course he is also blasting rockets into space and – unless I’m missing something – there aren’t electric rocket refuel stations dotted throughout the universe as of time of publication.

Yet his central point stands. The reality of goodness is often very much at odds with the perception of it.

In regards to environmental claims it is happening so often that it’s already been given a slightly cringeworthy but inarguably evocative term: greenwashing.

Greenwashing is put simply the act of pretending you are doing more for (or less to) the planet than you actually are. It’s trendy to be green but it’s also really inconvenient and costly. So companies say they are green when in actuality they are closer to baby-poo colour.

It’s so persuasive that the ACCC made greenwashing their ‘compliance and enforcement priority’ for the year – which is basically the equivalent of their Macquarie Dictionary word of the year – celebrating the occasion with a huge sweep of company websites in search of misleading environmental and sustainability marketing claims.

The consumer watchdog hit leading retailers and service providers across a number of sectors: energy automotive household products appliances food and drink packaging cosmetics clothing and footwear. It was quite the sweeping.

It was also as they say in the sweeping industry a bloody bonanza!

The ACCC found that 57% of the businesses they reviewed were making misleading environmental claims. Another way of saying “57% of businesses” is to simply say “most businesses.”

Most businesses operating in Australia lie about what they are doing to help the environment. That’s a real styrofoam cup of non-sustainable coffee in the face isn’t it?

The worst offenders were the cosmetics companies clothing and footwear companies and the food and drink sectors.

So as long as you don’t wear clothing groom yourself or consume liquids and solids – you’re treading fairly lightly on the earth at the moment. The rest of us aren’t even if we’re really trying to.

The anger at this kind of thing is understandable – after all if we as a society are forced to put up with paper straws then the corporations had better be playing along too especially if they are boasting about doing so.

They aren’t though. And it’s hard to turn greenwashing claims into actual legal action. The ACCC knows that most companies are full of shit (baby-poo colour or not?) but it’s hard to prove.

And so the rewards of fudging your green credentials may be deemed to outweigh the risks of being caught.

Perhaps the silliest example of this in recent times was the ACCC’s first attempt at bringing a ‘greenwashing’ case.

Of course the term ‘greenwashing’ wasn’t in the common parlance back in December 2016 when the consumer watchdog alleged Kimberly-Clark Australia made false and misleading claims about their ‘flushable’ Kleenex Cottonelle toilet wipes: Namely that they were indeed flushable.

“The ACCC alleged that by labelling these products as ‘flushable’ consumers would believe the Kleenex wipes products had similar characteristics to toilet paper and would break up or disintegrate in a similar timeframe.”

Fair enough too. Especially seeing ‘Kleenex’ is also one of those brand names that is used interchangeably for the entire generic line of products (see also: Hoover Esky Frisbee Dumpster) and therefore is even more misleadingly deemed to be flushable.

Not so. In 2019 (these things take time) the trial judge found Kimberly-Clark Australia had not made false and misleading claims about the flushability of the wipes. Case dismissed. “Flush that justice” the Kimberly-Clark lawyer cackled. (I can only assume.)

After all the flushable wipes could be flushed. The untold damage they caused once flushed was beside the point.

Technically batteries are edible too.

The judge ruled that “to prove its case against Kimberly-Clark the ACCC was required to prove that the Kleenex Wipes had in fact caused or contributed to real harm in particular instances.”

In other words where are the tangled knots of unspeakable filth clogging up septic tanks and waterways? Where are the fish choking? Where is the evidence?

There was evidence of course from Australian water authorities who testified they face “significant problems when non-suitable products are flushed down the toilet as they contribute to blockages in household and municipal sewerage systems known as ‘fatbergs’”.

First let’s pause and consider the word fatberg. I don’t like it – it’s too descriptive. Any thought of sewage blockages should be vague at best not vivid and vomit-inducing.

Now the reason the ACCC case failed was simply that there wasn’t a specific example of a specific Kleenex Wipe being flushed and leading to specific damage. “In particular instances” is the key term here.

Nevermind that according to Polly Hemming a senior researcher at the Australia Institute “You could see with your own eyes that these wipes were choking up sewers – they pulled seven metres of them out of a Queensland sewer” adding: “It’s absurd when physical evidence has no weight in these matters.”

On appeal the ACCC “sought clarification from the Full Federal Court on whether proof of actual harm is required to establish that a claim is misleading.”

A lie is still a lie irregardless or whether it causes harm – or can be shown to cause harm. But common sense and the law are two different things.

Even the Full Federal Court judgement seems to acknowledge how silly the ruling was noting. “One response would be to introduce legislation or standards governing the characteristics of what can and what cannot be marketed or sold as ‘flushable’.”

Bingo!

Thankfully this past year has seen the legislation tighten up. Fines of up to $50 million can now be issued for greenwashing and the ACCC has drafted guidance for businesses regarding greenwashing.

I’ve also drafted some guidance for businesses planning to lie about their green credentials: Don’t do it. Not because it’s evil – that’s a strong word although it is definitely morally dubious. Don’t do it because even if you think you’ll get away with it you won’t.

As Morrissey once sang: “There’s always someone somewhere with a big nose who knows and trips you up and laughs when you fall.”

Greenwashing is the actual word of the year. Everyone is talking about it everyone is looking for it everyone is pointing the finger. The internet loves a pile-on.

Remember when Joel Madden from Good Charlotte did a PETA ad and then a KFC ad?

Remember when McDonald’s introduced paper straws that were actually non-recyclable?

Remember when Active Super touted its ethical and environment-friendly investments while holding interests in tobacco coal and gas? (ASIC are currently suing them.)

We all noticed. None of it made for blistering PR when it was revealed.

Here’s a wild idea: If you say you are doing a good thing – then do the good thing.

Let’s see how Earth responds to that.

Enjoy your week.

(NYSE:KMI) is heavily dominated by institutional owners,"Key Insights

Significantly high institutional ownership implies Kinder Morgan's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions

The top 25 shareholders own 50% of the company

13% of Kinder Morgan is held by insiders

Every investor in Kinder Morgan Inc. (NYSE:KMI) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 64% ownership. In other words the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.

Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.

In the chart below we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Kinder Morgan.

See our latest analysis for Kinder Morgan

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Kinder Morgan?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

Kinder Morgan already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Kinder Morgan's historic earnings and revenue below but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Kinder Morgan. Our data suggests that Richard Kinder who is also the company's Top Key Executive holds the most number of shares at 12%. When an insider holds a sizeable amount of a company's stock investors consider it as a positive sign because it suggests that insiders are willing to have their wealth tied up in the future of the company. For context the second largest shareholder holds about 7.8% of the shares outstanding followed by an ownership of 6.8% by the third-largest shareholder.

A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 25 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.

Story continues

While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.

Insider Ownership Of Kinder Morgan

While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.

Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.

Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Kinder Morgan Inc.. Insiders own US$4.9b worth of shares in the US$39b company. That's quite meaningful. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders especially in a company of this size. You can click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public-- including retail investors -- own 24% stake in the company and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership while considerable may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.

Next Steps:

While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company there are other factors that are even more important. For example we've discovered 2 warning signs for Kinder Morgan (1 is significant!) that you should be aware of before investing here.

Energy stocks have woefully underperformed this year. While the S&P 500 is up more than 19% the energy stocks in that index are down by an average of 2%.

That underperformance has many energy stocks looking like relatively compelling investment opportunities these days. Enterprise Products Partners (EPD -0.28%) Kinder Morgan (KMI 0.68%) and NextEra Energy (NEE 0.23%) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as the top ones to buy this December. Here's why they think investors should scoop up shares this month.

If you like passive income Enterprise has you well covered

Reuben Gregg Brewer (Enterprise Products Partners): If there's one thing that gets a dividend investor's blood pumping it's a fat yield like the 7.5% yield on offer from Enterprise Products Partners. The only thing investors need to be careful about when looking at mouthwatering yields like that is whether they're sustainable. Enterprise's yield is very well covered.

For starters the North American midstream giant operates a portfolio of energy infrastructure assets that would be virtually impossible to replace or replicate. Those assets are mostly fee driven as well so the cash flows they produce are highly reliable despite the inherent volatility of oil and natural gas prices. This is why master limited partnership (MLP) Enterprise has managed to increase its distribution annually for 25 consecutive years.

But the real strength of the distribution shows up in two other ways. First Enterprise's balance sheet is investment grade-rated. In other words it's financially strong. Second its distributable cash flows cover the distribution 1.7 times over. That leaves a huge amount of room for adversity before the distribution would be at risk. And even then Enterprise could lean on its balance sheet for a little while to support the payment if it had to. There's no telling how long Enterprise's yield will be as lofty as 7.5% so investors looking for a reliable income option should probably act sooner rather than later -- before the rest of Wall Street catches on to the story.

Flexing its flexibility

Matt DiLallo (Kinder Morgan): Kinder Morgan has spent several years shoring up its balance sheet. The natural gas pipeline giant has sold assets and used excess cash flow to reduce its debt. It has cut its debt by more than $11 billion since 2015 reducing its leverage ratio by 23%. It's on track to end this year with a leverage ratio of 4.0 well below its long-term target of 4.5.

That has given the company lots of financial flexibility. It recently found an opportunity to put some of its financial capacity to work. It agreed to buy STX Midstream from NextEra Energy Partners in a $1.8 billion deal. Kinder Morgan capitalized on the opportunity to buy a high-quality natural gas pipeline business from NextEra Energy Partners which needs cash to redeem some maturing financing. It's getting a good deal on a highly strategic asset.

The company expects STX Midstream to be accretive to its cash flow per share. Meanwhile it's only using a fraction of its financial capacity since the acquisition will increase its leverage ratio by 0.1 times in the near term. So it still has ample financial flexibility to make additional deals.

Kinder Morgan should also benefit from a growing slate of high-return expansion projects. It ended the third quarter with $3.8 billion of expansions under construction that should come online over the next few years. They'll supply the company with incremental income as they enter service.

Those two growth drivers should increase the company's cash flow. That will give it more money to pay dividends. Kinder Morgan has given its investors a raise for six straight years and currently offers a 6.4%-yielding payout. That combination of income and growth puts Kinder Morgan in a solid position to produce attractive total returns in 2024 and beyond.

Time to get greedy

Neha Chamaria (NextEra Energy): After plunging dramatically toward the end of September shares of NextEra Energy have regained some ground in recent weeks. I expect the stock to maintain its momentum and believe it's a solid buy this month. That's because NextEra Energy has its growth plans in place and some of the fears about the company appear unwarranted.

NextEra Energy stock slumped after its majority-owned limited partnership company NextEra Energy Partners slashed its dividend growth goal through 2026 in the wake of higher interest rates that made funding for growth difficult. Investors feared two things: NextEra Energy could be next in line to cut its growth forecast and lower income in the form of dividends from the limited partnership could hit its bottom line.

During its most recent earnings release though NextEra Energy said it was confident of growing its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 6% to 8% through 2026 off its 2024 estimate and expects to increase its dividend annually by around 10% at least through 2024. Management even stated it would be ""disappointed"" if the company didn't grow at the higher end of its range through 2026. NextEra Energy expects its planned investments in its utility Florida Power & Light (FPL) and renewable energy to drive growth. While FPL expects to invest up to $34 billion between 2022 and 2025 NextEra Energy's clean energy arm already has a humongous backlog of over 21 gigawatts.

For a company that's still growing its cash flows and dividends steadily and prioritizes a healthy balance sheet NextEra Energy looks like the kind of company that should not only be able to navigate challenging times but also reward shareholders along the way. With the utility stock now languishing at three-year lows and yielding 3.2% it makes for a solid long-term buy now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vaW52ZXN0b3JwbGFjZS5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8zLWVuZXJneS1zdG9ja3MtdG8tcGljay11cC1iZWZvcmUtdGhlLXllYXItZW5kLXJhbGx5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Energy Stocks to Pick Up BEFORE the Year-End Rally,,,,,,,

Sebastian Siemiatkowski said the Swedish buy now pay later giant was no longer bringing on new staff beyond its engineering department predicting that AI would allow him to reduce the number of staff employed at the business.

“There will be a shrinking of the company” Mr Siemiatkowski said attributing the change to widespread use of tools such as ChatGPT. “We’re not currently hiring at all apart from engineers.”

The hiring freeze at one of Europe’s biggest technology companies comes 18 months after it sacked hundreds of staff during a deep tech downturn.

However Mr Siemiatkowski insisted the decision to only hire engineers was motivated by his belief in the potential of AI rather than reflective of business fundamentals.

Klarna recently turned its first quarterly profit in four years and is gearing up for an IPO expected in the next year.

Mr Siemiatkowski 42 told The Telegraph: “Things that previously took people a lot of time can be done much faster and much shorter and we need fewer people to do the same thing. The right thing for us is just to say: ‘let’s not recruit now let’s see how this plays out’.”

Klarna is not planning layoffs. However Mr Siemiatkowski said people departing voluntarily meant he expected the size of the company to shrink over time.

He said AI was “a threat to a lot of jobs” across the economy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9uZXdzL2tsYXJuYS1sb3N0LTEtMDAwLXBhaWQtMTIwMDAwMTQ4Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Klarna lost £1000 I paid it – and blamed me for having fat fingers',"Has a company treated you unfairly? Our Consumer Champion is available to help. For how to contact her click here.

Dear Katie

Last year I bought a dishwasher and washing machine from Hughes Electrical and decided to pay using the “buy now pay later” credit facility offered by Klarna which allowed me to spread the cost over one year.

In October this year I contacted Klarna as I wanted to pay off the loan early and in full. The customer services person I spoke to gave me the sort code account number and references to use and I sent two payments totalling over £1000 for the appliances.

Now Klarna is saying it cannot find my payments and is trying to pursue me for the balance. My bank Barclays has confirmed the payments went through yet I continue to receive automated demands for a debt I consider cleared.

I am 100 per cent sure I got the payment details correct. I don’t know what else I can do? I feel Klarna’s actions are completely appalling.

I have cancelled my direct debit with it but I am very concerned that its continued demands for payment will impact my credit rating. It is also causing me so much stress.

I have called Klarna so many times and sent numerous emails but I am not seeming to be getting anywhere.

– RM Cambridgeshire

Dear reader

Klarna kept insisting these two payments (£569.71 and £496.14) were not showing on its system. But you are absolutely sure you sent the money to the right place.

The only thing I knew for sure at this point was that someone was wrong and I set about finding out who.

After I made contact with Klarna it sent you another email saying it had concluded its investigation and was not upholding your complaint.

This was because it believed its agent had provided the correct bank details and references for each of your orders on the phone. It didn’t say this explicitly but it was clearly convinced you’d made a fat-fingered typo when making the payment meaning it had not been received and explaining why it couldn’t find it.

This sent you into a rage but then it did an about-turn saying it had reevaluated your case and had decided to uphold it after all. Why? Well unbelievably after all that it had found the payment. Both you and I were baffled as to how it had been unable to until now and what had suddenly changed.

Klarna explained it was because you had opted to use a manual payment through your bank account instead of a direct debit or payment through its app which it “always advises” apparently.

It also blamed “an error” within its systems in matching your manual payment to your account due to your bank adding extra characters to the payment reference. This was in no way your fault and Klarna said it was “working to fix the issue”.

Klarna has also admitted its customer service team could have worked much better to help you quicker and is updating its processes to make sure this doesn’t happen again.

It’s now apologised and paid you £100 compensation which you’re happy with. Your credit score will be unaffected by Klarna’s utter incompetence during this episode but I suspect your ego at being falsely accused of being unable to make a payment correctly will remain bruised for a while.

A Klarna spokesman said: “We’re very sorry for the inconvenience caused to the customer but can confirm the issue has now been resolved. We have offered him compensation as a gesture of goodwill. We’re working on fixing the issue to ensure this does not happen again.”

“This strategic investment underscores Mayor Uy’s commitment to improving the overall healthcare landscape in the city” said Lumbatan ensuring that citizens receive prompt and accurate diagnostic procedures.

By investing in this new laboratory Mayor Uy aims to bolster the capacity of JRBGH to handle a wider range of medical tests and operations.

This expansion directly translates to shorter waiting times for patients and the provision of more accurate and timely results enabling healthcare professionals to administer appropriate treatments swiftly.

The addition of modern laboratory facilities further solidifies JRBGH’s reputation as one of the leading healthcare institutions in the region according to Lumbatan.

Under the guidance of Mayor Uy she added that the administration has consistently prioritized the improvement of healthcare infrastructure.

By focusing on projects like the new laboratory at JRBGH the city government seeks to address the longstanding issues of accessibility and affordability faced by Kagay-anons in their pursuit of quality medical care she stressed.

“The facility’s advanced technology will not only streamline critical processes but also pave the way for more cost-effective healthcare solutions to be offered to the community” Lumbatan said.

Meanwhile Mayor Uy expressed his gratitude to the officials and staff of JRBGH for their unwavering dedication in making the new laboratory a reality.

He emphasized that this achievement contributes significantly to his vision of a healthy and progressive city where every resident can easily access the healthcare services they need.

“The inauguration of the new laboratory serves as a testament to Mayor Klarex Uy’s unwavering commitment to the well-being of Kagay-anons” said Lumbatan.

She said this project aims to improve the efficiency and affordability of healthcare services by providing essential medical equipment and technology.

Last week a jury ruled that the egg producers used several methods to limit the domestic supply of eggs to increase the price of products during the 2000s.

While the exact time frame of the alleged conspiracy was debated throughout the case jurors eventually concluded damages occurred between 2004 and 2008.

Food manufacturers joining as plaintiffs in the lawsuit against the egg producers are Kraft Foods Global Inc. The Kellogg Company General Mills Inc. and Nestle USA Inc.

MORE AMERICANS THAN EVER THINK US HEADED IN WRONG DIRECTION AS CONGRESS' APPROVAL NEAR ROCK BOTTOM: SURVEY

The damages awarded could be tripled under U.S. antitrust law to more than $53 million. It capped the second phase of a two-part trial against Cal-Maine Foods (CALM.O) which is the country's largest egg producer and distributor and Rose Acre Farms the second-largest over claims that they overcharged for egg products.

""We are extremely grateful for the jury's service and findings. This was an important case for many reasons and the jury's award recognizes its significance"" Brandon Fox an attorney representing the food manufacturers said in a statement.

The same Illinois jury held the egg producers responsible for the alleged antitrust conspiracy after a more than five-week trial but Ridgeland Mississippi-based Cal-Maine and the other defendants had denied any wrongdoing.

In a statement Cal-Maine called the damages amount ""modest"" compared to what the plaintiffs sought. The company also added that it will ""continue to evaluate its options including if necessary an appeal.""

Officials stated that Cal-Maine would also have to share responsibility for the damages award with the other three defendants.

This is a phenomenon called “shrinkflation” a term used to describe products staying the same price or increasing in price while reducing the actual amount of product they give you.

Numerous examples of this have gone viral and sparked discussion over the years on TikTok. One user showed how Betty Crocker reduced the size of their cake mix; another showed how the weight of sauce in a frozen meal was being counted toward the overall weight leading to a reduction in product. A further TikToker showed himself opening a personal-sized bag of Doritos—only to discover it had just five chips.

Now some shoppers are calling out Kraft for reducing the size of its Kraft Dinner often called simply Kraft Mac and Cheese in the U.S.

In several videos shoppers have noted that the size of their normal Kraft Dinner box is decreasing.

TikTok user Stephanie (@stephyparker123) discovered that a crate of Extra Creamy Kraft Dinner contained boxes with two different weights despite all appearing to be the same size.

“200 175 200” she says reading off the boxes’ weight in grams. In the caption she adds “@KD Canada explain yourselves…I need the full 200 grams of macaroni.”

Another TikTok user Carley (@carley_larley) came to the same conclusion while looking at the original flavor.

“What in the shrinky-dink is going on around here?” she asks. “This is getting ridiculous.”

“A week and a half to two weeks ago-ish I bought this from Walmart. 225 grams ‘kay?” she continues. She then points to the listed weight of 200 grams on a second box. “Today I bought this box for the same price.”

In the comments section of both videos users complained about shrinkflation.

“JUST said this to my wife last week when we split a box and felt like it wasn’t as much in it!” exclaimed a commenter. “Also used to be like .39 cents a box only 5 years ago.”

“We used to feed a family of four fullllll bowls with one box” recalled another.

“And they’d already shrunk before. doesn’t fill the bowl anymore” shared a third. “I feel less guilty downing the whole box though.”

The Daily Dot reached out to Stephanie via Instagram direct message Carley via TIkTok direct message Kraft via email and Walmart Canada via Media Relations Contact Form.

Update 8:04am CT Dec. 5: In an email to the Daily Dot a Kraft Heinz spokesperson shared the following:

“The food industry continues to navigate inflationary pressures across ingredients labor and transportation and Kraft Heinz is not exempt from these pressures. As a result of increased production costs we have reduced the total volume of grams per packaged box for Kraft Dinner and updated the packaging to reflect this change. Our goal is always to offer quality products at an affordable price and we are diligently seeking efficiencies across our business to provide more value to consumers across income levels.”

Update Dec. 8 2023 3:33pm CT:

In an Instagram direct message exchange with the Daily Dot Stephanie shared her thoughts on shrinkflation.

“It’s terrible” she wrote. “It’s yet another thing that big corporations think they can get away with and they do because as long as people are buying it they’ll keep doing it. And it’s not just Kraft; we’d have to boycott all of the major companies at this point which would be unheard of on a large enough scale to make a difference.”

“So there’s no way to change it without creating some kind of legislation to force transparency on quantity changes” she continued. “That way the quantity reduction is at least noticeable to consumers.”

As for Kraft’s explanation about rising costs Stephanie says she’s not buying it.

“Sounds like more corporate greed” she stated. “As if ‘increased production costs’ are forcing them to reduce quantities. I’m sure they make more than enough money to keep the quantity the same. They’d rather rip off their customers in this terrible economy than make a fraction less revenue.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9wbGFudC1iYXNlZC1tZWF0LW1hcmtldC1zaXplLTA2MzUwMDc1NC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plant-based meat market size to grow by USD 12.53 billion from 2022 to 2027 | Albertsons Co.

Plant-based meat market 2023-2027: Drivers and challenges

The new product launches are notably driving the market growth. Due to the growing health awareness of consumers and environmental concerns the demand for plant-based meat products is increasing. To meet the growing demand for plant-based meat products vendors around the world are launching new products. Successful new product launches increase suppliers' revenue streams and market share. One such new product launch includes two new iterations of its plant-based burger with one version offering a more meaty experience and the other being a more nutritious version of its burger by Beyond Meat. Such factors will drive market growth during the forecast period.

However increasing consumption of animal meat is a major challenge impeding the market growth. Consumption of meat such as pork beef and chicken is increasing in several countries such as the United States China India and Russia. In quantitative terms the US was the largest beef market in 2020. Beef consumption in the US grew significantly between 2019 and 2020. Quantitatively chicken consumption increased by more than 2% in the United States and 1% in China in 2019-2020. Thus increasing consumption of animal meat products will negatively affect the growth of the global market during the forecast period.

Take for example Stanley Tucci’s latest GreenPan Cookware collab Chrissy Teigen’s array of swanky yet efficient cookbooks Pauly DelVecchio’s (a.k.a. DJ Pauly D from MTV’s “Jersey Shore”) Italian Subs and Selena Gomez’s line of Our Place multifunctional cookware. The list offers just a taste of how vast celebrity-food partnerships have become in recent years. And it underscores the trendy business venture’s place in pop culture especially as countless celebrities are now launching their own food drinks and snacks.

“What does a celebrity actually know about making a good cookware set?” asked Bon Appetit’s Megan Wahn. “What the heck does it mean if you’re the chief creative officer of a beverage company? What does a singer know about making hot sauce or granola?”

Not much nothing really and not much. After all celebrities live to entertain — on-screen off screen on the covers of tabloids and in snarky headlines. Their whole public persona is also a tool of profit both for themselves and for those who exploit their popularity. Simply put celebrities (both their face and name) are the driving force behind so many of these food products. It’s less about whether a specific item tastes good and more about how much money and online buzz it will generate. Think about it: a plain simple energy drink is well just plain and simple. Once you pair it with a celebrity endorsement then suddenly that same drink transforms into something sexy and lucrative.

That’s the case with Kim Kardashian’s latest collaboration with the vitamin and supplement business Alani. The reality TV star businesswoman and aspiring lawyer has her own energy drink flavor that’s essentially a healthified rendition of pink lemonade. Called Kimade the drink boasts vitamin B6 and B12 and features a blend of tart lemons and sweet strawberries making it “the ultimate sip of sweet with a dash of sour!”

Of course no Kardashian-backed product is complete without an elaborate photoshoot. As Kim shows us Kimade can be enjoyed during a workout sesh while wearing a white bodysuit matching white kitten heels and white acrylic nails. It can also be enjoyed outdoors namely during a ski excursion that calls for a skin-baring outfit — white puffer jacket paired with matching colored bikini bottoms. Or after a long day of surfboarding in your favorite pink bikini!

A pack of six Kimade beverages can be purchased for just $18. Clearly the enticing price and the promise of a good time were enough to intrigue consumers because Kimade is currently sold out on Alani’s official website.

Other noteworthy celebrity-backed foods include Ed Sheeran's Tingly Ted Hot Sauce which is made in partnership with Kraft Heinz. According to the company’s website Ted is a grumpy bear who is also Sheeran’s sidekick and co-creator of the “first tingly sauce known to man (and bear of course)."" For just $13 customers can buy not just one but two Tingly Ted signature sauces: the classic Tingly sauce and the Xtra Tingly sauce which amps up the spice level.

There’s also Jason Mraz’s Granola (launched in collaboration with Michele's Granola Mraz’s now sold out Mystical Magical Matcha Granola flavor is named after his newest album “Mystical Magical Rhythmical Radical Ride”) Taika Waititi’s eponymous caffeinated canned beverage brand Taika Mariah Carey's Cookies (unfortunately they are not available via online order at this time) and Millie Bobby Brown’s Florence by Mills Coffee Concentrate.

Amid the digital age celebrity endorsements are proving to be incredibly powerful as companies seek ways to hike profits and expand their customer base. Social media in particular serves as a catalyst for good business allowing both companies and celebrities to attain free PR. Users try a product and then spotlight it on their social media which increases publicity and encourages others to follow suit.

A product doesn’t necessarily have to taste good in order to garner this treatment. It just has to look enticing enough. Take for example McDonald’s Grimace Shake the berry-flavored milkshake that became an internet sensation from June 12 to July 9 of this year. The shake went viral on TikTok with the #GrimaceShake trend where users filmed themselves drinking the shake and then finding themselves in sinister situations. The trend failed to portray the short-lived shake in a favorable manner but it certainly benefited McDonald's financially. According to the fast food giant’s quarterly earnings report net sales were up 14% and net income increased to $2.31 billion compared with $1.19 billion a year earlier.

Marketing psychology also plays a key role in the effectiveness of celebrity-backed products. Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business studied people’s eye movements and pupil dilation when they came across mock advertisements of snack foods that featured either celebrities or generic models. They found that people are more likely to choose products that are endorsed by a celebrity rather than a non-celebrity. That decision is also made pretty quickly.

“Viewers had less pupil dilation when choosing a product that was advertised with a celebrity an indication that they were spending less time deliberating their choice and were more confident about their decision” the findings explained.

Celebrities help build “consumer confidence” meaning consumers associate the high-profile traits of A-listers with the products they are touting. That doesn’t mean celebrities can make consumers choose a product they absolutely hate. But they certainly aid in hyping up the visuals of a specific food snack or drink. It’s why Kim’s Kimade is packaged in a slim pink can alongside funky typography or Sheeran's Tingly Ted Hot Sauce is sold in a cartoonish-looking squeeze bottle.

Food marketing basically plays into two of our key senses: sight and taste. Sight is what lures consumers in. Taste is what makes them stay.

The fact that celebrity-backed foods are already increasing in quantity and variety is reason to believe that similar endorsements are yet to come in the future. As for whether companies will soon place more emphasis on their Hollywood endorsers and forgo taste is something only time can tell. What’s certain though is that food companies are capitalizing off of celebrities and vice versa. It’s a symbiotic relationship that won’t be perishing anytime soon."

Not only do I give homemade chocolate cookies and candy to friends and family but I also bake a chocolate cake for my December birthday. To pull this off with less stress I keep a variety of chocolate in my pantry including cocoa powder chocolate chips and a variety of chocolate bars to make baking on a whim easy.

Related: What Happens to Your Body When You Eat Chocolate Every Day

For baking bars I like to keep both bittersweet and unsweetened dark chocolate bars in stock. When it comes to chocolate chips semisweet dark are my go-to. Milk chocolate is less commonly used for baking but I still like to keep it on hand. Then there’s cocoa powder of which I keep both natural and Dutch-processed in my pantry. And I like to have chocolate candy melts around too which I use if I want a shiny chocolate coating without the fussy process of tempering.

Related: What's That White Coating on My Chocolate—and Is It Safe to Eat?

All of these types of chocolate are available from different brands at a variety of price points. The flavor and quality of chocolate varies widely from brand to brand. This means that it’s important to give the brand of chocolate you buy more attention than say the brand of milk when it comes to baking. You will literally be able to taste the difference.

How do you know what brand of chocolate to buy? The best piece of advice I’ve received on this topic was to buy chocolate that you enjoy the taste of. It’s the same advice cooks are given when it comes to cooking with wine. Cook with wine you like drinking and bake with chocolate you like eating! Not bad advice right?

And while it sounds simple we often consider chocolate for eating to be different from the chocolate we use for baking. They are in separate aisles after all. But really the only difference between the two is that baking chocolate doesn’t typically include additional ingredients like nuts and flavorings and it can be sold in larger quantities than chocolate designed for eating out of hand.

Personally I’m a fan of Ghirardelli chocolate for baking. I like how it tastes plus it’s affordable and Ghirardelli has a wide variety of products. And I’ve found that the best place to buy Ghirardelli chocolate is at Kroger.

My local Kroger carries a full range of groceries and housewares and while I don’t buy all my groceries there I do pop in weekly—I buy most of my baking supplies dairy products and dry goods at Kroger.

And their Ghirardelli chocolate selection can’t be beat. Plus their prices are often lowest. I checked Amazon Target Walmart and Safeway and the prices were higher the selection was limited or both. Kroger is the only store that consistently sells a wide variety of the Ghirardelli products I love to stock my pantry with at a good price. For instance when I checked prices recently Ghirardelli's unsweetened chocolate bar at Walmart was more than twice as much as at Kroger!

Another bonus of buying my chocolate at Kroger is that they also stock vegan and gluten-free chocolate which I use when I’m baking for people with certain dietary preferences. And since I can just pick those up at Kroger I don’t have to make a separate trip or place an order online. I definitely don’t mind checking other stores when I happen to be there because I might get a good deal every now and then but if I’m going to buy a lot of chocolate I’m for sure going to Kroger.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jb3VyaWVyLWpvdXJuYWwuY29tL3BpY3R1cmUtZ2FsbGVyeS9zcG9ydHMvcHJlcHMvMjAyMy8xMi8wMi90cmluaXR5LXRha2VzLW9uLWJyeWFuLXN0YXRpb24tY2xhc3MtNmEta2VudHVja3ktaGlnaC1zY2hvb2wtZm9vdGJhbGwtY2hhbXBpb25zaGlwLzcxNzY2Njk3MDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,KHSAA football: Trinity high school vs. Bryan Station in championship,"PREPS

WAY TO KRO Kroger confirms it will tweak Christmas hours for more than one day nationwide – but it isn’t all bad news

KROGER will be changing the hours of its stores for certain days later this month.

Customers may need to plan ahead for those Christmas essentials.

1 Kroger is changing its opening hours for the Christmas period

Kroger has announced some adjustments to its opening hours for Christmas.

While the exact hours may vary from store to store all locations will be closed on Christmas Day and closing earlier than usual on Christmas Eve.

Christmas is the only day of the year when all Kroger stores close nationwide.

As you may remember they were even open on Thanksgiving unlike competitor stores.

The holiday hours for your local store will be posted at the entrances.

Times will vary by region but in many areas stores are open until 9 pm on Christmas Eve.

Some will be closed earlier at 6 pm.

The day after Christmas New Year's Eve and New Year's Day all stores will be open as normal.

MORE CHRISTMAS CLOSURES

Many grocery stores observe Christmas Day as a holiday and keep their doors closed to allow employees to spend time with their families.

Kroger rival Walmart will also be closing its approximately 4500 nationwide stores on December 25.

Shoppers will have their final chance to score last-minute gifts on Christmas Eve when most stores will be open from 6 am until 6 pm.

Target will also be closing all of its approximately 2000 nationwide stores on Christmas.

Much like Walmart many Target stores will also be closing early on Christmas Eve at 8 pm instead of the usual 10 pm.

On the other hand some retailers will keep stores open for longer in the run-up to Christmas to welcome holiday shoppers.

The US Sun has put together a full list of these retailers so you know where you can get your shopping done.

Many non-grocery retailers will also be partially closed over the holiday period.

Nordstrom Rack has adjusted its hours at all 348 stores.

And so has an iconic book retailer with nearly 600 locations.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vcmV0YWlsL3dhbG1hcnQtYWRkcy1hLWJlbG92ZWQtaXRlbS10YXJnZXQta3JvZ2VyLWFuZC1jb3N0by1kb250LXNlbGzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walmart adds a beloved item Target Kroger and Costco don't sell,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/retail/walmart-adds-a-beloved-item-target-kroger-and-costo-dont-sell on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vcmV0YWlsL3dhbG1hcnQtYWRkcy1hLWJlbG92ZWQtaXRlbS10YXJnZXQta3JvZ2VyLWFuZC1jb3N0by1kb250LXNlbGzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Read Transcribed Audio

As winter sets in and daylight fades earlier you may be starting to notice some familiar patterns.

Perhaps you're having a hard time getting out of bed in the morning even if you slept a solid eight hours. Maybe your appetite has increased or you don't feel like leaving the house.

It could be that you just feel sad.

""People have heard the term SAD or seasonal affective disorder — and affective is just a psychiatric term for mood"" said Dr. Raymond Lam a professor of psychiatry at UBC who has spent decades researching seasonal depression.

""These are people who have clinical depressions but only during the wintertime"" Lam told Dr. Brian Goldman host of CBC's The Dose .

""By spring and summer they are actually feeling better — and in the summertime they're feeling well.""

What is SAD?

SAD is another name for seasonal depression or winter depression. It's listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders as a subcategory of clinical depression.

Roughly 15 per cent of Canadians will have at least one mild episode of SAD in their lifetime while two to three per cent will have more severe episodes according to the Canadian Psychological Association . In order to be diagnosed symptoms need to significantly undermine daily functioning experts say.

But even if that's not the case you may still not feel your best at this time of year said Lam.

""We also think about seasonality as a dimension or a spectrum"" he said.

Some people may experience the ""winter blues"" he said.

""They have a lot of the same symptoms of winter depression — but not to the point where it's really interfering significantly with their functioning.""

WATCH | Canada rolls out new hotline for mental health crises: 988 hotline's top doctor explains why the service is needed now Duration 1:55 Dr. Allison Crawford chief medical officer of Canada's new suicide prevention hotline says responders will be available 24/7 to help people in crisis.

What causes winter depression?

While it's difficult to establish the exact biological cause of most mood disorders research has shown the connection between winter depression and the reduced amount of daylight caused by shorter days Lam said.

""SAD may be like a form of jet lag where there's a disconnect between the internal clock and the external environment"" said Lam. ""Light is the strongest synchronizer of that biological clock.""

Other research connects seasonal depression and serotonin one of the neurotransmitters in our brains that helps regulate our moods.

Serotonin ""clearly has a seasonal pattern of metabolism"" said Lam.

Because of changes in daylight we have higher levels of serotonin in summer and fall and the lowest levels in winter and early spring he said.

What are the symptoms?

Common symptoms for winter depression include low mood reduced energy fatigue increased appetite craving carbohydrates weight gain withdrawing from activities and problems with concentration and memory.

More serious cases could include thoughts of hopelessness and suicide.

""When you're in that state of mind the journey from the bed to the couch is a long journey"" said Marian Goldstone an educator and mental health worker in Manitoba.

Goldstone speaks from experience both professionally as a consultant for the non-profit Mood Disorders Association of Manitoba and personally through her lived experience with depression.

""One of the things that I want to do in the winter more than anything else is socially isolate. And I have to keep pushing myself to keep connected with people"" she said.

Shine a light on it

There are many options for treating winter depression or preventing symptoms from worsening.

One of the most common treatments is light therapy which researchers have been studying for 40 years.

During light therapy people sit in front of a light device or lamp for about 30 minutes each morning.

""It isn't a one-off treatment. You have to continue using it on a daily basis"" said Lam.

Light therapy is a common and effective treatment for winter depression experts say. (Halifax Public Libraries)

About 60 to 70 per cent of people using light therapy get relief from their depression symptoms with most noticing within a week or two he said.

Lam said it's important to choose a light device that is bright enough to be effective.

""The key ingredient is really the intensity of light"" said Lam.

That intensity is determined with a light measurement called lux defined as the amount of illumination when one lumen is evenly distributed over a square metre. Experts recommend using a light device that has a 10000-lux intensity.

Put in context direct sunlight can be from 50000 to 100000 lux while typical lighting in a home's living room would be less than 100 lux Lam said.

For the 30-minute light therapy sessions the device needs to provide the 10000 lux of intensity to someone who is sitting a reasonable distance away from it — not just a few inches he added.

""You can be reading or eating breakfast or looking at your screens during that time"" said Lam.

What else can ease symptoms?

Seeing a therapist can help with experts pointing to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as being particularly effective in reducing symptoms of winter depression.

""People say 'Oh I always get depressed in the winter. I'm never gonna be able to do anything'"" said Lam. But CBT he said can help change a person's negative thought patterns about winter.

""It's this extremely powerful tool to gain control of emotions through understanding the way we think"" added Natasha Sharma a therapist and owner of NKS Therapy in Toronto.

Exercising outside during the winter can help with symptoms of depression experts say. (CBC/Radio-Canada)

Getting regular exercise particularly outdoors can make a difference all though the winter.

""We have to continue to get outside even when it's cold"" said Sharma. ""That fresh air that exposure to daylight plays a big role.""

Some people may benefit from taking antidepressant medication said experts.

How to prepare

People who know they are prone to seasonal depression symptoms can take steps to be better prepared said Sharma.

She recommends creating a mid-summer calendar reminder to start monitoring your mood and self-care efforts. Steps could include journaling eating healthier and sleeping well.

Goldstone advises having a support team in place before the worst of the symptoms hit.

""What do I have to watch for? Who do I need around me to help get me through this?"" Goldstone said.

""It's pretty hard to do that kind of work when you're down in the tank in the middle of January.""

Other factors

Be mindful of other things happening in our environment at this time of year that may be affecting our mood said Sharma.

That could be holiday stress or even current events that we find disturbing.

""It's hard to tease out how much of this is seasonal affective disorder and how much of this is our environment that kind of goes a little crazy towards the end of the year"" Sharma said.

""The environment plays a huge role in our mental health … we are living in a very difficult time.""

According to private sources who requested anonymity the Las Vegas Sands Corp-owned resort is poised to initiate the marketing of this deal as early as the next quarter The Edge Singapore reports.

The plan includes rolling over a delayed drawdown facility refinancing existing loans and introducing new deb. However these deliberations are in their early stages and the terms of the deal may undergo adjustments. Denying the reports Ron Reese Senior Vice President of Global Communications for Las Vegas Sands stated “We are neither in the market nor looking for $10 billion in loans.”

If the deal reaches its maximum size it is poised to set a new record as Singapore’s largest syndicated loan funded in the local currency. This colossal financial move aligns with Marina Bay Sands’ recovery efforts from the pandemic coinciding with Singapore’s anticipation of a surge in tourists particularly from mainland China.

In an October filing Marina Bay Sands’ parent company highlighted the expansion plan’s escalating costs citing inflation increased material expenses and labour costs as key factors. The initially estimated amount of $4.5 billion is expected to be substantially exceeded due to these unforeseen economic challenges.

Sources suggest that Singaporean lenders including DBS Group Holdings Ltd. Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. and United Overseas Bank Ltd. may take on the roles of lead mandated arrangers and bookrunners in the new deal reminiscent of the 2019 loan agreement. Maybank Securities Pte is also expected to be part of this consortium before the deal is more widely syndicated to other lenders.

While a significant portion of the new funds will be allocated to refinancing existing debts Marina Bay Sands is reportedly considering borrowing an additional amount of up to $2 billion as part of this comprehensive financial package.

It is worth noting that the previous syndicated loan record in Singapore dates back to 2012 with a $9.3 billion facility supporting the acquisition of food and beverage maker Fraser & Neave Ltd. by Thai billionaire Charoen Sirivadhanabhakdi’s TCC Assets Ltd. /TISG",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9kYWxsYXMvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzEyLzAzL21hcmstY3ViYW4tdGV4YXMtZ2FtYmxpbmcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mark Cuban: Texas economy needs Vegas-like casinos - Dallas Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2023/12/03/mark-cuban-texas-gambling.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9kYWxsYXMvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzEyLzAzL21hcmstY3ViYW4tdGV4YXMtZ2FtYmxpbmcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnN0YXRlc21hbi5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzEyLzAyL21hcmstY3ViYW4tZGFsbGFzLW1hdmVyaWNrcy1jYXNpbm9zLXRleGFzLzcxNzczNDc4MDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did Mark Cuban give the effort to bring casinos to Texas a big lift?,"No commitment required.

(WRAL) - It was a scary couple of hours but a puppy that fell down a well in North Carolina is now OK and back with its family.

Mudge the 100-pound Great Dane fell into an old well Saturday afternoon.

“We called 911 right away. And they come out they don’t have the they have to call the right department that has the right equipment” Janine Haldene Mudge’s owner said. “They had to bring that tripod situation with all the climbing harnesses and everything to get down there.”

Crews from Cary Fire Fairview Rural Fire and the Swift Creek Fire Department responded.

They used a rope rescue technique and although it took hours and plenty of patience but crews were able to lift Mudge out.

“I don’t know but unscathed I just can’t even believe it. It’s quite the drop and it is covered up now by the way it’s completely covered up” Haldane said. “So yeah you know part of me kind of wonders yeah part of me kind of wonders you know did she fall to save someone else?”

So how did Mudge get down in that old well?

Mudge’s owners recently bought the property and the well sits quite a distance from the family home. They did think it would be a problem but now they know differently.

Mudge is now home safely and her family couldn’t be more thankful for first responders.

“They did all of this for my dog. And she is part of our family truly so God bless them” Haldane said. “They were very very organized when they showed up. They had a plan. They knew exactly what to do.”

The owners said Mudge came out of the hole with just a small scratch on her ankle.

The tour includes arena shows in Melbourne Sydney and Adelaide an open-air gig at Perth’s Kings Park and Botanic Garden and A Day on the Green events at wineries in Mount Cotton the Hunter Valley and Bowral.

Taylor will celebrate his 76th birthday shortly before the tour commences. Next year will also mark the 50th anniversary of Taylor’s fifth album Walking Man which is regarded as one of the American singer-songwriter’s lesser releases. Recent setlists have focused on songs from 1970’s Sweet Baby James and 1968’s James Taylor as well as highlights from throughout Taylor’s six-decade career.

James Taylor – ‘Country Road’

The aforementioned Sweet Baby James featured many of Taylor’s best-known and most cherished originals such as ‘Country Road’ and ‘Fire and Rain’ while his self-titled debut album was home to ‘Carolina in My Mind’ and ‘Something in the Way She Moves’.

The 2024 tour comes more than seven years after Taylor’s most recent Australian tour a theatre and winery jaunt in February 2017. Prior that visit Taylor’s trips to Australia had been scarce. His recorded output has been similarly intermittent in recent decades but in 2020 Taylor released his 20th album American Standard.

The band have seemingly bowed out of live performing at their huge Madison Square Garden show last night (December 2). They will reportedly be the first US band to become virtual.

In the encore the band’s remaining members – founders Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons along with guitarist Tommy Thayer and drummer Eric Singer – left the stage revealing their new digital avatars. After walking off stage the digital avatars performed “God Gave Rock and Roll to You”.

“Today A New Era Begins. #KISSARMY the end is only the beginning!” the band wrote on social media. “KISS have been immortalized and reborn as avatars to rock forever.”

AP reports that the avatars were made by George Lucas’ SFX company Industrial Light & Magic. They were also made in collaboration with Pophouse Entertainment Group which was co-founded by ABBA‘s Björn Ulvaeus.

The two companies previously teamed up to create the ABBA Voyage show in London which also features the Swedish band performing as digital avatars. Our five-star review of the show praised the avatars remarking that “you can’t tell the difference between man and machine.”

In a roundtable interview Stanley said: “What we’ve accomplished has been amazing but it’s not enough. The band deserves to live on because the band is bigger than we are. It’s exciting for us to go the next step and see Kiss immortalized.”

“We can be forever young and forever iconic by taking us to places we’ve never dreamed of before” Simmons added. “The technology is going to make Paul jump higher than he’s ever done before.”

CEO of Pophouse Entertainment Per Sundin said that the new avatars will allow Kiss to continue for “enternity”. He revealed that unlike ABBA the band would not perform on stage alongside the virtual band as “that’s the key thing.”

“Kiss could have a concert in three cities in the same night across three different continents” he said. “That’s what you could do with this.”

Simmons has previously hinted at the band’s virtual transformation in interviews. Speaking to 519 Magazine this November he said that “this tour is the end of the road for the band not the brand.”

“KISS is a universe of its own – movies merchandise maybe even Broadway” he continued. “The band will end but the KISS experience… it’s immortal.”

He also spoke about the physical challenges of touring and why the band were retiring from the stage: “We are the hardest-working band on stage. I’ve got 40 pounds of armour and all the rest of it and seven-inch platform heels. Each of the dragon boots weighs as much as a bowling ball. Physically it’s tough to do that.”

There has been speculation that the band might take up residency at Las Vegas mega venue The Sphere. However Stanley was quick to shut down rumours commenting: “I can’t speak to it in any other way except to be honest with you about how I feel now and the way I feel today is … I can’t really see that happening” he told the outlet.

“As far as I’m concerned we’re done.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIzLTEyLTA0L2F1c3RyYWxpYW4tbGl2ZS1tdXNpYy12ZW51ZXMtc3RydWdnbGluZy1jbG9zaW5nLWRvd24vMTAzMTYxOTc00gEoaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuYWJjLm5ldC5hdS9hcnRpY2xlLzEwMzE2MTk3NA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Australian live music venues 'firmly in crisis' as gig goers shift behaviours post-lockdown,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-12-04/australian-live-music-venues-struggling-closing-down/103161974 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFiYy5uZXQuYXUvbmV3cy8yMDIzLTEyLTA0L2F1c3RyYWxpYW4tbGl2ZS1tdXNpYy12ZW51ZXMtc3RydWdnbGluZy1jbG9zaW5nLWRvd24vMTAzMTYxOTc00gEoaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuYWJjLm5ldC5hdS9hcnRpY2xlLzEwMzE2MTk3NA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The OCTs are now in place for integration on 42 smallsats that Lockheed Martin is building for the Space Development Agency’s (SDA) Tranche 1 Transport Layer. The Transport Layer provides low-latency and high-volume data connectivity for SDA’s Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture.

In the previous OCT product release designed for SDA Tranche 0 Transport and Tracking Layer TESAT delivered in total 58 OCTs to five different satellite manufacturers. Out of those 58 OCTs 48 units are on-orbit today — 46 units are on SDA’s Tranche 0 satellite network that launched earlier this year and provides a resilient network of integrated capabilities.

In preparation for the SDA Tranche 1 Flight Model delivery TESAT successfully performed interoperability tests with a third party using an Engineering Model out of TESATs high volume OCT manufacturing line. With the successful interoperability testing of the Engineering Model TESAT`s OCTs are ready to exchange data with other third-party products.

The improved design of the OCT for SDA Tranche 1 consists of a Dual EU the combination of two optical heads with one Electronic Unit (EU) to save weight and space on satellite payloads with a transmission rate of 2.5 Gbps. TESAT is currently ramping up its production capacity utilizing a new manufacturing building at the site that is close to completion. With the adjusted production capacity of OCTs and the resulting cost reduction TESAT is prepared to deliver the necessary amount for LEO OCTs to satisfy future market needs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwYWNlLmNvbS9sb2NraGVlZC1tYXJpbi1lc2Etc2F0ZWxsaXRlLWRlbW9uc3RyYXRvci1jYWxpYnJhdGlvbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lockheed Martin's 'Tantrum' tech could help get satellites up and running without the wait,"Lockheed Martin and Firefly Aerospace are combining to launch a demonstrator that aims to slash the time it takes spacecraft payloads to become operational.

The unique wideband Electronically Steerable Antenna (ESA) developed by Lockheed Martin will test rapid calibration and could pave the way to payloads becoming operational much quicker. Calibration is the process of fine-tuning the sensor system to ensure it operates accurately and effectively once it is in orbit.

While it can take months for traditional on-orbit sensors to be powered on fully calibrated and readied to perform their mission the company says it expects the new ESA sensor to be calibrated in a fraction of the time.

The payload demonstrator nicknamed Tantrum will launch aboard Firefly Aerospace's Alpha rocket in December. The technology is critical to future remote sensing architectures according to Lockheed Martin.

In September Firefly Aerospace launched a Space Force mission 27 hours after receiving its orders setting a new responsive-launch record.

""Our customers' mission needs and operational tempo have increased dramatically"" said Maria Demaree vice president and general manager of National Security Space at Lockheed Martin Space in a statement .

""We designed this technology to showcase how a highly producible ESA antenna could be built launched and quickly calibrated and fielded on orbit in support of 21st Century Security.""

The ESA payload uses a new scalable design using off-the-shelf commercial parts for quick mass-producibility. The payload is integrated on a Nebula small satellite bus developed by Terran Orbital.

The Falcons will head to Texas for a duel with the Dukes hoping to end 2023 on a high note.

The cadets hope to bounce back.

The Air Force Falcons ended the regular season on a four-game losing streak but the program’s four-game winning streak in bowl games is still intact and will be on the line when they face the Sun Belt’s James Madison Dukes in the Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl.

It's Official! The 2023 Lockheed Martin Armed Forces Bowl will feature the #24 James Madison Dukes (11-1) and the Air Force Falcons (8-4).

Troy Calhoun’s cadets rode high for most of the 2023 season starting the year with an 8-0 record that included wins over rivals Navy and Colorado State. However injuries caught up with the team as the year progressed and the Falcons first fell to Army and then finished the regular season with three more losses. Despite the disappointing finish though Air Force is in a bowl game for the third straight year the third such streak in Calhoun’s tenure as head coach.

James Madison had a similar surge rising as high as #18 in the AP poll before suffering a three-point loss to Appalachian State in the penultimate game of the season. Nonetheless the Dukes finished 11-1 in their second season of FBS action though they will head into their first bowl season without head coach Curt Cignetti who was hired by the Indiana Hoosiers earlier this week.

This year’s Armed Forces Bowl is set for Saturday December 23. It will be broadcast on ESPN kicking off at 1:30 PM Mountain/12:30 PM Pacific.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyLWZvcmNlLXRyeWluZy1zYXZlLWYzNS1qZXQtZnJhbmtlbi1iaXJkLWZpZ2h0ZXItMjAyMy0xMtIBXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzaW5zaWRlci5jb20vYWlyLWZvcmNlLXRyeWluZy1zYXZlLWYzNS1qZXQtZnJhbmtlbi1iaXJkLWZpZ2h0ZXItMjAyMy0xMj9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Air Force trying to save wrecked F-35s by making a 'Franken-bird' jet,

Both went to Wilson High School. Both had a love of baseball.

And both got their start in sports journalism at the Press-Telegram.

This year they added something else to share: although they didn’t hit home runs pitch no-hitters or steal bases Lowe 64 was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown New York for his incredible sports writing skills. He joined his fellow Wilson grad Newhan 86 who had been inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2001.

As far as anyone knows this is the first time that two baseball writers from the same high school in the United States have been inducted into the venerable Hall of Fame according to Dave Daniel secretary-treasurer of the Baseball Writers Association of America Los Angeles-Anaheim chapter.

Newhan and Lowe were recently honored at the annual meeting of the BBWAA at Clearman’s North Woods Inn in La Mirada.

“Ross and John are an esteemed pair each with unique and amazing careers” Daniel said. “They are so special to Wilson High and Long Beach.”

The only other Wilson High graduate in the Baseball Hall of Fame is the late Cleveland pitcher Bob Lemon.

In interviews after the lunch Newhan and Lowe reminisced about their careers and their early years in Long Beach.

Newhan attended Lowell Elementary and Rogers Middle schools before entering Wilson in 1951. Growing up he played baseball in streets and parks saw Pacific Coast League games at the old Wrigley Field in Los Angeles with his father and loved all sports — but especially baseball.

He said he didn’t have a real sense of direction until he took a journalism-creative writing class with a teacher John Gartner who inspired him.

“Nobody in my life has been more influential than John Gartner on two things” Newhan told me. “He talked passionately about the use of words and he saw something in me I couldn’t see in myself. He told me that I had the ability to use words to write.”

In that first class with Newhan was also Richard Bach who went on to write the bestselling book “Jonathan Livingston Seagull.” Newhan remembered Bach as “a great guy with a great interest in creative writing.”

Gartner made Newhan sports editor of Wilson’s student newspaper The Loudspeaker in his senior year.

“I could express myself in writing’ Newhan said. “It was a lot of fun.”.

At the same time the Press-Telegram (then known as the Independent Press-Telegram or I-PT) was looking for someone part-time to call in results of high school sports games over the phone to the sports desk. Newhan took that job and eventually started covering high school and college games and learning how to write headlines edit copy and design pages before landing a full-time job covering the American League’s expansion team in 1961.

That team of course was the Angels.

He attended classes at Cal State Long Beach but dropped out to work full-time. He covered the Angels for the Press-Telegram joined the U.S. Army and then in 1968 joined the Los Angeles Times where he covered the Dodgers and Angels and eventually became the paper’s national baseball writer until he retired in 2004.

Some of his favorite baseball moments Newhan said included Reggie Jackson’s three homers in one game against the Dodgers in the 1977 World Series; the pitching duel between John Smoltz of the Atlanta Braves and John Morris of the Minnesota Twins in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series (Morris and the Twins won); and the Boston Red Sox winning Game 5 against the Angels in the 1986 American League Championship Series.

In an interview with author Jeff Pearlman in 2014 Newhan was asked about technological changes in journalism.

“When I started in the old days of 1961” he replied “they had Western Union operators in all the press boxes and you would hand your typewritten page to the operator and cross your fingers that they would send it to the paper the way you had written it.”

Newhan said he felt fortunate to remain productive after more than a half century in sports journalism.

He lives in Corona with his wife plays “a little” golf and is active with the Corona Rotary Club and other nonprofits. He has written books on the history of the Angels and one on coaching baseball successfully.

He also stays in close touch with his son David who lives in Tucson Arizona. David played for several Major League Baseball teams before going into coaching. Because of his father’s writing job David had the nickname “Son of Scribe” while he was playing. David’s son Nico is a star high school player.

John Lowe meanwhile credited is “Mom’s Olds” with starting him on his 57 years of “baseball enthusiasm” he said during his Hall of Fame induction speech in Cooperstown this year.

Lowe was a second-grader in suburban St. Louis in 1966 the year he realized what the World Series was when the Baltimore Orioles played the Los Angeles Dodgers.

“School got out at 3 p.m.” he said. “If I walked home as usual I would miss the first moments of the game on TV. So that I could see the game from the start I asked my mom to pick me up for the brief drive home. She said she would. At 3 I saw her waiting in her gray Oldsmobile.

“Decades later” he added “I asked her why she was willing to pick me up at school so I could see the first moments of a game. She said ‘I thought it was important.’”

His mom was right Lowe said. By striving to see the first pitch he said “I began a lifetime lesson: the more enthusiastically I dove into baseball the more I would be rewarded.”

Thanks to his mom Nadine he got home in time to see “big doings” in the top of the first inning when Frank Robinson and Brooks Robinson of the Orioles homered back-to-back giving Baltimore control of the game and the series — which they won 4 games to 0.

In St. Louis Lowe developed his love of baseball while listening to the colorful Harry Caray broadcasting Cardinals games on the radio.

“It was intoxicating listening to him” Lowe said. “He brought so much excitement to games.”

Lowe especially remembered Caray’s broadcasting of the thrilling 1967 World Series which the Cardinals won over the Boston Red Sox.

Lowe was born in San Diego but when he was 4 he moved to St. Louis where his father worked as an aeronautical engineer for McDonnell Douglas.

His father eventually transferred to McDonnell Douglas in Long Beach where Lowe played some Little League baseball and attended Hill Middle School and then Wilson High. At Wilson he was inspired by teacher Nancy Stimson who was also the adviser for the student newspaper.

“She let me learn about myself” he said “how to be myself.”

Lowe became sports editor and then editor-in-chief of The Loudspeaker. While still in high school just like Newhan he started working for the Press-Telegram handling high school games taking information on the phone editing copy and listings and eventually writing some of his own stories.

Lowe said he got his job through Gary Ellis an editor who would periodically talk to students in Stimson’s class.

“In 1976 right there in our classroom/newsroom” Lowe said “Gary asked me to join the prep crew of part-timers at the I-PT.”

Press-Telegram sports writers Tracy Ringolsby and Gordie Verrell were also great role models who helped him learn Lowe said.

“Tracy and Gordie urged a sports editor they knew Frank Mazzeo of the Los Angeles Daily News to hire me for my first full-time job” Lowe said.

He soon had his first baseball beats covering the Angels and then the Dodgers. After a two-year stint with the Philadelphia Inquirer Lowe went to the Detroit Free Press where he spent the next 28 years covering the Tigers and national baseball.

When his Hall of Fame induction was announced the BBWAA described Lowe during his career as “nattily attired in his blazer collared shirt with tie creased trousers leather shoes and straw hat roaming press boxes fields and clubhouses.”

Lowe’s reporting the BBWAA statement said “resulted in clearly written stories that explained the sport in rich detail.”

Lowe is credited with creating the quality start statistic for pitchers. A quality start is when a pitcher throws at least six innings and allows three or fewer runs.

“That just grew out of my observations and reporting” Lowe told me. “Whitey Herzog (then manager of the Cardinals) would say ‘All I’m looking for from my starter is six good innings.’ I noticed that often a pitcher did that but didn’t get a win. I thought there has to be a better way of keeping track of a pitcher giving his team a chance to win.”

Lowe said his most memorable moment in baseball came when he covered the game in which Cal Ripken of the Baltimore Orioles broke the long-standing record of 2130 consecutive games played which had been held by Lou Gehrig of the New York Yankees.

Ripken broke the record against the California Angels on Sept. 6 1995.

Lowe lives in Seal Beach where he is relaxing but is still busy reading keeping fit and resuming his study of Spanish. After the BBWAA lunch Newhan and Lowe posed for photos and talked more about their times at Wilson High.

“I was way earlier than John” Newhan said with a grin “but both of us can say ‘Go Bruins!’”

Editor’s note: John Gartner was Ross Newhan’s journalism-creative writing teacher in school. Newhan joined the Los Angeles Times in 1968. Because of a reporting error Gartner’s first name and the year Newhan joined the LA Times were incorrect in a previous version of this story.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy52YS5nb3YvMTI2NDI4L251cnNlLXNlcnZlcy12ZXRlcmFucy1uYXRpdmUtYW1lcmljYW4tY3VsdHVyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nurse practitioner serves Veterans shares Native American culture - VA News,"At Bay Pines VA delivering positive health care outcomes is just one part of serving Veterans. Another crucial aspect of serving those who’ve served is ensuring that the trust they’ve placed in us remains untarnished.

Christina Flint-Lowe works continuously to ensure Veterans and their loved ones know that at VA they are safe.

“What I value about working at VA is that we get to approach challenges with our Veterans’ care at the forefront. When I worked in the private sector the model was always very results-driven but being here flips the script a little. I get to honor the Veteran with each decision I make” Flint-Lowe said.

American Indian/Alaska Native Special Emphasis program manager

Although she didn’t deepen her connection to her culture until she became an adult Flint-Lowe’s heritage and her work are inextricably intertwined.

Nurse Christina Flint-Lowe

“I am a member of the Poarch Band of Creek Indians. I didn’t grow up on the reservation but my grandparents were both part of the community. Growing up they didn’t talk much about being native but I think part of that was a protective feature. They were living in a time when it wasn’t popular to identify as being Native American.”



When Flint-Lowe did visit her reservation there was a familiar feeling. The more she learned the more knowledge she craved and the desire for understanding was deepened when she gave birth to her son.



“My want to learn is not only for myself but for my son because I want to pass our heritage on to him. Later in my adulthood I decided to go back to school to receive my masters in Native American Leadership. Through those courses I realized I have a responsibility to something greater than myself.”



In addition to her role as a nurse practitioner Flint-Lowe also serves as Bay Pines VA’s American Indian/Alaska Native Special Emphasis program manager. In this role she conducts outreach to local native communities and educates staff about various customs and traditions.



“I encourage people to remain curious and open because through that process people reach a mutual understanding and respect of one another. My story is just one of many but I feel honored to be a representative of the community. It’s something I don’t take lightly.”



Although she has never shied away from voicing what she feels is right Flint-Lowe knows that being a representative in any capacity requires balance. As both a nurse practitioner and a Special Emphasis program manager advocacy remains at the forefront of her mind.



“My work requires managing my expectations while truly considering the needs of those around me. Being provided the opportunity to have leadership in both roles at VA fills me with gratitude.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNyYXNoLm5ldC93c2JrL25ld3MvMTA0MDQzOS8xL2xvd2VzLTIwMjQtZ29pbmctYmVzdC1zZWFzb24tZXZlci13b3JsZHNia9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lowes: 2024 'is going to the best season ever in WorldSBK',"The factory Kawasaki rider not only thinks it will be the best season ever in WorldSBK but he also called it the most important of his career.

“For me it is going to be the best season ever in Superbike with fantastic riders competitive riders competitive bikes and with the rule changes there are lots of bikes that can be competitive” said Lowes.

“There's a lot of storylines with Jonathan [Rea] moving Toprak moving to BMW Iannone coming my brother coming and new teams.

“I think next year is going to be the best Superbike season and I need to make sure it’s my best one.”

Discussing his own objectives for next season in further detail Lowes was quick to point out that development of the ZX-10RR will fall predominantly on his shoulders after six-time world champion Jonathan Rea left for Yamaha.

“I need to do well next year” began Lowes. “It’s an important year for me. A good season means we have to work hard in the winter to give ourselves the best chance.

“It’s a shame that Jonathan left Kawasaki. I enjoyed being his team-mate but now I have a different role.

“I’m the experienced guy I know the bike and so doing the job to improve the bike is on my shoulders.”

As part of the 2024 line-up which saw Andrea Iannone join the championship Lowes will have a very familiar rider competing against him after Sam Lowes and Elf Marc VDS also joined the series with Ducati machinery.

The two brothers have never competed against one-another on the world stage something Alex can’t wait to do.

“I’m really excited to have him in the championship” said Lowes. “I think it’s going to be maybe take a bit of time with a new rider new team in the championship.

“But we can expect him to be at the front challenging at the front challenging for podiums and I’m looking forward to battling with him on track. It’s extra motivation to finish ahead of him.”"

A Tennessee couple found transporting millions of dollars’ worth of cocaine was killed in Texas on Thursday during a traffic stop shootout with law enforcement authorities said.

Edward and Elizabeth Stevenson were first identified through undercover buys of illegal drugs the Putnam County Sheriff’s Office said Monday.

The undercover work allowed investigators to get a search warrant for the Stevensons' home where detectives uncovered nearly a pound of suspected methamphetamine suspected fentanyl multiple firearms body armor and ammunition on Thursday the sheriff’s office said.

During the search detectives learned that the Stevensons were driving a semi-truck through Texas with illegal drugs and were armed.

""Both Edward and Elizabeth had made previous statements that they would die by 'suicide by cop' if law enforcement attempted to stop them"" the sheriff’s office said.

Detectives immediately alerted the Donley County Sheriff's Office in Texas and Texas Department of Public Safety about the couple.

When deputies in Donley County tried to pull over the semi-truck the couple continued to drive for several miles before coming to a stop officials said.

Edward and Elizabeth then exited the vehicle and opened fire on deputies and troopers the sheriff's office said. The Stevensons were killed in the ensuing shootout.

Authorities searched the couple’s vehicle and found about 64 pounds of suspected cocaine valued at an estimated $3.4 million. The sheriff’s office said the drugs appeared to be en route to Tennessee.

Putnam County Sheriff Eddie Farris blamed open border policies that are making it ""much easier for Mexican cartel members and their associates"" to traffic illegal drugs into smaller communities.

Farris said the cocaine seized from the Stevensons would likely have been mixed with fentanyl before being sold to individuals.

The sheriff thanked community members for calling in anonymous tips about the couple.

Burnett Plaza the tallest building in Fort Worth Texas has been purchased via foreclosure auction for $12.3 million just three years after it was sold for more than $137.5 million according to the Dallas Business Journal.

The 40-story behemoth was bought back by Pinnacle Bank Texas in the auction held on the steps of the Tarrant County courthouse on Tuesday.

Pinnacle had claimed in public filings that the tower's former owner Burnett Cherry Street LLC an affiliate of New York-based Opal Holdings LLC defaulted on a $13 million loan used to purchase the building in 2021.

As well as being the tallest in Fort Worth Burnett Plaza is also considered the largest with over one million square feet of commercial office and retail space according to its website.

Sales,"Francis Bacon's Portrait of George Dyer Crouching (1966) was expected to be the night's top lot. It sold for just $27.7 million failing to even reach its low estimate.

Sotheby’s kicked off this month’s marquee New York auctions with two sales on Monday evening one devoted to established contemporary artists the other to emerging ones. Together the two auctions brought in $267.3 million for a total squarely within its pre-sale estimate of $241.8 million to $350.4 million.

These were the first two big auctions to take place during the annual May New York sales with others to follow at Christie’s and Phillips. All these sales are happening against the backdrop of concerns of a weakening market and fewer estates coming to the block than in previous years. Simply based on estimates alone the sales at Christies Sotheby’s and Phillips are down by around 18 percent compared to the ones held this time in 2023.

Going into the sale Sotheby’s at least had a leg up on Christie’s whose website was still down on Monday reportedly following a cyberattack. But the action at Sotheby’s this evening was relatively sluggish doing little to dispel fears of a market slowdown.

Monday evening’s most expensive lot was Francis Bacon’s 1966 painting Portrait of George Dyer Crouching the first of 10 full-scale portraits by Bacon depicting his lover George Dyer. The work on offer had been in the same collection for 54 years having sold to its consignor in 1970 just four years after Bacon finished it. It came to auction with a $50 million high estimate a number that seemed poised to put the painting among the most expensive ones by Bacon ever sold publicly.

Unfortunately for Sotheby’s it was a big flop failing to even meet its low estimate. The painting ended up selling for $27.7 million. (All figures reported here include premium unless noted otherwise.) Murmurs abounded; many seemed awed by this hyped work’s implosion on the block.

Highs and Lows in “Now” Sale

The evening started out with more modest sums in the 18-lot “The Now” sale devoted to the ultra-contemporary category which refers to emerging artists and ones just gaining momentum at auction.

Eighteen lots were due to be offered but one a Cecily Brown painting was withdrawn before the sale’s start. Sixteen of the lots sold most of them performing respectably and about half selling above their estimates once premiums were counted in.

The top price in the sale was achieved by Kerry James Marshall’s 2005 painting Vignette #6 which had never before come to auction. It was acquired by its consignor at Jack Shainman Gallery in 2005 and had not been seen at market since then.

Expectations ran high for this painting since another painting from Marshall’s “Vignette” series sold in 2019 for $18.5 million at Sotheby’s becoming his second-most expensive painting at auction. This painting which came to auction with a guarantee didn’t perform quite so well hammering at $6.5 million $500000 below its $7 million low estimate. With premium however that sum rose to $7.48 million.

The other major disappointment was Jeffrey Gibson’s evening sale debut which came following the inauguration of the artist’s US Pavilion at the Venice Biennale last month. That should’ve provided ballast for his market—Simone Leigh’s 2022 pavilion certainly did for hers that year—but when Gibson’s 2014 sculpture Always After Now came up for sale at Sotheby’s it failed to garner a single bid. It was the only work that went unsold in the “Now” sale tonight.

The big story of the evening was a 2019 Justin Caguiat painting called The saint is never busy. This young New York–based painter’s abstractions had only ever appeared at auction twice in the past and Sotheby’s clearly thought this one would do well awarding it the primo Lot 1 slot. The house’s expectations ended up being correct: a six-minute bidding war pushed this painting far beyond its $300000 estimate more than tripling that sum when it sold for $1.09 million a new record for Caguiat.

The other big record in this sale was for Lucy Bull whose abstractions have already done well at auction. Her 2020 painting 16:10 quickly zoomed past its $700000 high estimate—which was admittedly a conservative number given that her work had already sold for $1.76 at Sotheby’s Hong Kong this past October. It seemed at times as though auctioneer Phyllis Kao could barely keep up. “Everybody gets a turn” she said smiling as the painting sped past the $1 million mark. It sold for $1.81 million more than doubling the estimate and generating a new benchmark for this 34-year-old painter.

A Low-Risk Contemporary Sale Sees Many Disappointments

Even though the “Now” sale did generate some momentum the contemporary sale couldn’t quite sustain the excitement of the evening’s first hour.

Even discounting the underwhelming Bacon sale other star lots also failed to deliver. A Richard Diebenkorn abstraction from his “Ocean Park” series initially pegged to sell for as much as $25 million failed to find a buyer altogether. The painting’s consignor according to Artnet News was Lorenzo Fertitta who bought it at Christie’s New York in 2018 for $23.9 million at the time a new auction record for the artist. On Monday auctioneer Oliver Barker had to fish for bids to even bring it past its $14.8 million low estimate.

A Lucio Fontana “Concetto Spaziale” painting brought to auction from the Rachofsky Collection threatened to topple the artist’s record altogether with a $30 million high estimate but it didn’t even hammer at its $20 million low estimate only meeting that sum once fees were counted in. The hammer price at $19.7 million rose to just under $23 million—a respectable figure since it still makes the painting one of Fontana’s most expensive works but one that was lower than the house had aimed for.

A shaped canvas by Frank Stella Ifafa I (1964) appeared on the block shortly after another big Stella sale. In November a Stella from collection of the late Chara Shreyer Honduras Lottery Co. (1962) sold for $18.7 million—at the time Stella’s second-highest price at auction. Artnet News’s Katya Kazakina reported that Ifafa I came to the block from none other than dealer Irving Blum whose Ferus Gallery showed Stella during the ’60s just as he had achieved renown. The painting hit the block with a $14 million low estimate and hammered right at that amount. Not even the artist’s death earlier this month had done much to raise interest.

This was a low-risk sale with 25 of the 35 lots coming to auction with guarantees meaning that much of the works had been pre-sold. But even by that measure this sale left something to be desired.

There were some successes. A collaborative painting by Andy Warhol and Jean-Michel Basquiat from 1984 sold for a new record for the duo’s series at $19.4 million squarely within the work’s $15 million–$20 million estimate. On the Nota Bene podcast earlier this week art adviser Lock Kresler a director at Helly Nahmad gallery in London said this one is considered to be among the best in the series; the highest price for a painting in the series at auction is $11.4 million achieved in 2014. The consignor bought this one at Sotheby’s in 2010 for just $2.7 million.

Four guaranteed Joan Mitchell paintings headed to auction at Sotheby’s on Monday with three of them selling for above their estimates. The priciest of them her abstraction Noon (ca. 1969) sold for $22.6 million. Just eight years ago the consignor had bought it at Christie’s for less than half that value.

Faith Ringgold who died in April saw a new record when Dinner at Gertrude Stein’s: The French Collection Part II #10 (1991) a quilted painting from the artist’s prized “French Collection” series came up for sale as the auction’s first lot. It came to auction from the collection of Stanley and Mikki Weithorn who lent it to a recent Ringgold retrospective. The painting was given a $700000–$1 million estimate—double the artist’s auction record of $461000 set at Swann Auction Galleries in 2015. Clearly Sotheby’s expected Dinner at Gertrude Stein’s to reset the record for the artist and it did selling for $1.57 million.

The flurry of bids for Ringgold’s painting made this work a rarity in this sale where the buying activity seemed depressed. By the time an Alice Neel portrait of poet and photographer Gerard Malanga came up for sale Barker was doing his best to stoke any energy at all. “It’s like extracting teeth my goodness” he said before the work sold for a within-estimate sum of $2.24 million. That remark could’ve been said at many different points tonight.

Still the evening ended on a positive note when Yayoi Kusama’s 1958 painting The Pacific Ocean sold for $4.66 million triple its high estimate. The work came to sale after its owner curator Alice Denney died last year at 101; seven minutes of bidding preceded that sale. “We’re going to have to forever put Kusama for the last lot!” Barker yelped. By that point however a good number of attendees had left for the evening so this rare moment of excitement was missed by many.

After three hours anyone who stayed until the end of the sale was probably hungry. But instead of the the usual assortment of cheese crackers and charcuterie available for guests there were only empty champagne glasses.

When ARTnews asked a Sotheby’s staffer about this change they simply replied “The market has changed.”"

Significantly high institutional ownership implies Marathon Petroleum's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions

The top 25 shareholders own 49% of the company

Insiders have sold recently

A look at the shareholders of Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company around 78% to be precise is institutions. Put another way the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).

Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight especially with individual investors. Hence having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.

In the chart below we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Marathon Petroleum.

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Marathon Petroleum?

Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.

We can see that Marathon Petroleum does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Marathon Petroleum's historic earnings and revenue below but keep in mind there's always more to the story.

Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Marathon Petroleum is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.9% of shares outstanding. BlackRock Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.3% of common stock and State Street Global Advisors Inc. holds about 7.1% of the company stock.

Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of Marathon Petroleum

The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business but the CEO will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our information suggests that Marathon Petroleum Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$79m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public-- including retail investors -- own 22% stake in the company and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour they can still make a collective impact on company policies.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Marathon Petroleum better we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Marathon Petroleum you should be aware of and 1 of them shouldn't be ignored.

David Tong global industry campaign manager at pressure group Oil Change International said: “[The global decarbonisation accelerator] is a dangerous distraction from Cop28. We need legal agreements not voluntary pledges. The science is clear: staying under 1.5C global warming requires a full fast fair and funded phase-out of fossil fuels starting now.”

Climate Trace data also revealed that emissions from aviation have bounced back strongly since the Covid lockdowns: carbon from international flights rose by 74% between 2021 and 2022 and from domestic flights by 18% over the same period. Road transport emissions also increased by 3.5% – probably a result of the rise in SUV sales.

There was also good news. Deforestation is dropping in key regions with emissions from the degradation and destruction of forests in the Congo Basin dropping by up to 19% in 2022 compared with the previous year.

Gavin McCormick a co-founder of Climate Trace and executive director of environmental nonprofit WattTime said: “By harnessing the power of AI and machine learning paired with the right data from satellites and beyond our models are giving us a picture of the world we’ve never seen before.

It operates through the following segments: midstream chemicals refining and marketing and specialties. The midstream segment provides crude oil and refined petroleum product transportation and processing services as well as natural gas and natural gas liquids transportation storage fractionation gathering processing and marketing services. The chemicals segment consists of Phillips 66's 50% equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical (CPChem) which manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The refining business refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products such as gasoline distillates and aviation fuels as well as renewable fuels at 12 refineries in the U.S. and Europe. The marketing and specialties segment purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products and renewable fuels.

Percentage Ownership: n/a Average Cost: n/a Activist Commentary: Elliott is a very successful and astute activist investor. The firm's team includes analysts from leading tech private equity firms engineers operating partners – former technology CEOs and COOs. When evaluating an investment the firm also hires specialty and general management consultants expert cost analysts and industry specialists. The firm often watches companies for many years before investing and has an extensive stable of impressive board candidates. Elliott has historically focused on strategic activism in the technology sector and has been very successful with that strategy. However over the past several years its activism group has grown and evolved and the firm has been doing a lot more longer-term activism and creating value from a board level at a much larger breadth of companies. The firm's activism has always been well thought out and the detailed analysis it presented here is evidence of that.

On Wednesday Elliott sent a letter to Phillips 66 announcing that it has taken a $1 billion stake and is seeking up to two board seats.

Activist investors like to claim that they are ""amicable"" or ""constructive."" While we do not generalize like that it is hard to imagine a more amicable and constructive activist campaign than what Elliott is proposing at Phillips 66.

Phillips 66 has underperformed peers Valero Energy and Marathon Petroleum by 45% and 191% respectively over the past three years and by 163% and 248% respectively over the past 10 years. Elliott thinks this can largely be attributed to the company's shift in focus away from the refining segment and management's poor execution in cost reductions which has led to a loss of investor confidence.

Since his elevation to CEO in July 2022 Mark Lashier has committed to a strategic outlook that includes refocusing on the refining segment cutting costs targeting $14 billion of mid-cycle earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization by 2025 selling $3 billion of non-core assets and increasing the company's long-term capital return policy. Elliott wholeheartedly agrees with this plan and thinks it could lead to a $205 stock price. The first part of an activist campaign convincing management that your plan is better than theirs is already done here. The only thing activists like more than a management team agreeing with the activist's plan is a management team that has its own plan that the activist agrees with.

But communicating a plan to the market is one thing getting investors to believe that you can execute is entirely another. There has been a lack of shareholder trust here much of which stems from the company's AdvantEdge66 program in 2019 aimed at reducing costs. When implemented Phillips 66 saw costs increase relative to peers burning shareholders' confidence in the management team's ability to achieve its goals. The first step in rebuilding management credibility would be adding new directors to the board particularly at the request of a shareholder. If those directors happened to have refining operations experience that would give investors even more confidence that management is shifting their focus back to the refining business.

Elliott has significant experience in partnering with industry experts and has already identified candidates here with relevant expertise to fill two board seats. Elliott is not asking for a board seat for itself to debate with management. The firm is asking for two seats for two industry executives who would put management in the best position to execute on their plan. The best activists use board seats to support management in executing their plan but they also will hold management accountable if they are unable to do so.

That is where Elliott's plan B comes into play. If Phillips 66 adds two new directors approved by Elliott and still cannot deliver on performance targets over the next year then it will need to take a path like the one Marathon Petroleum took in its transformation. This will include making appropriate management changes closing the current $2 to $3 per barrel refining EBITDA gap between Phillips 66 and Valero and generating $15 billion to $20 billion from the sale of non-core assets including their CPChem stake European convenience stores and a portion of non-operated midstream stakes.

This should be an easy decision for the company and we would expect it to quickly appoint two new directors identified by Elliott to the board. Given the tone and substance of Elliott's outreach it would be very surprising and disappointing to see this go to a proxy fight. However if it did we believe Elliott would be a lock to get at least two board seats on the 13-person board particularly with the use of a universal proxy card.

David Tong global industry campaign manager at pressure group Oil Change International said: “[The global decarbonisation accelerator] is a dangerous distraction from Cop28. We need legal agreements not voluntary pledges. The science is clear: staying under 1.5C global warming requires a full fast fair and funded phase-out of fossil fuels starting now.”

Climate Trace data also revealed that emissions from aviation have bounced back strongly since the Covid lockdowns: carbon from international flights rose by 74% between 2021 and 2022 and from domestic flights by 18% over the same period. Road transport emissions also increased by 3.5% – probably a result of the rise in SUV sales.

There was also good news. Deforestation is dropping in key regions with emissions from the degradation and destruction of forests in the Congo Basin dropping by up to 19% in 2022 compared with the previous year.

Gavin McCormick a co-founder of Climate Trace and executive director of environmental nonprofit WattTime said: “By harnessing the power of AI and machine learning paired with the right data from satellites and beyond our models are giving us a picture of the world we’ve never seen before. And it’s allowing us to make climate progress in a way some never believed possible.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vcHJvLnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vdHJhZGUtaWRlYXMvaS1tLXJlZmluaW5nLW15LW9wdGlvbnMtcGxheS1vbi1waGlsbGlwcy02Ni0xNjEzOTI0ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I'm Refining My Options Play on Phillips 66,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://pro.thestreet.com/trade-ideas/i-m-refining-my-options-play-on-phillips-66-16139248 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vcHJvLnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vdHJhZGUtaWRlYXMvaS1tLXJlZmluaW5nLW15LW9wdGlvbnMtcGxheS1vbi1waGlsbGlwcy02Ni0xNjEzOTI0ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMDIvaG93LWFjdGl2aXN0LWVsbGlvdHQtY291bGQtYnVpbGQtc2hhcmVob2xkZXItdmFsdWUtYW1pY2FibHktYXQtcGhpbGxpcHMtNjYuaHRtbNIBc2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIzLzEyLzAyL2hvdy1hY3RpdmlzdC1lbGxpb3R0LWNvdWxkLWJ1aWxkLXNoYXJlaG9sZGVyLXZhbHVlLWFtaWNhYmx5LWF0LXBoaWxsaXBzLTY2Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here’s how activist Elliott could build shareholder value amicably at Phillips 66,"Business: Phillips 66 is an energy manufacturing and logistics company. It operates through the following segments: midstream chemicals refining and marketing and specialties. The midstream segment provides crude oil and refined petroleum product transportation and processing services as well as natural gas and natural gas liquids transportation storage fractionation gathering processing and marketing services. The chemicals segment consists of Phillips 66's 50% equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical (CPChem) which manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The refining business refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products such as gasoline distillates and aviation fuels as well as renewable fuels at 12 refineries in the U.S. and Europe. The marketing and specialties segment purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products and renewable fuels.

Percentage Ownership: n/a Average Cost: n/a Activist Commentary: Elliott is a very successful and astute activist investor. The firm's team includes analysts from leading tech private equity firms engineers operating partners – former technology CEOs and COOs. When evaluating an investment the firm also hires specialty and general management consultants expert cost analysts and industry specialists. The firm often watches companies for many years before investing and has an extensive stable of impressive board candidates. Elliott has historically focused on strategic activism in the technology sector and has been very successful with that strategy. However over the past several years its activism group has grown and evolved and the firm has been doing a lot more longer-term activism and creating value from a board level at a much larger breadth of companies. The firm's activism has always been well thought out and the detailed analysis it presented here is evidence of that.

On Wednesday Elliott sent a letter to Phillips 66 announcing that it has taken a $1 billion stake and is seeking up to two board seats.

Activist investors like to claim that they are ""amicable"" or ""constructive."" While we do not generalize like that it is hard to imagine a more amicable and constructive activist campaign than what Elliott is proposing at Phillips 66.

Phillips 66 has underperformed peers Valero Energy and Marathon Petroleum by 45% and 191% respectively over the past three years and by 163% and 248% respectively over the past 10 years. Elliott thinks this can largely be attributed to the company's shift in focus away from the refining segment and management's poor execution in cost reductions which has led to a loss of investor confidence.

Since his elevation to CEO in July 2022 Mark Lashier has committed to a strategic outlook that includes refocusing on the refining segment cutting costs targeting $14 billion of mid-cycle earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization by 2025 selling $3 billion of non-core assets and increasing the company's long-term capital return policy. Elliott wholeheartedly agrees with this plan and thinks it could lead to a $205 stock price. The first part of an activist campaign convincing management that your plan is better than theirs is already done here. The only thing activists like more than a management team agreeing with the activist's plan is a management team that has its own plan that the activist agrees with.

But communicating a plan to the market is one thing getting investors to believe that you can execute is entirely another. There has been a lack of shareholder trust here much of which stems from the company's AdvantEdge66 program in 2019 aimed at reducing costs. When implemented Phillips 66 saw costs increase relative to peers burning shareholders' confidence in the management team's ability to achieve its goals. The first step in rebuilding management credibility would be adding new directors to the board particularly at the request of a shareholder. If those directors happened to have refining operations experience that would give investors even more confidence that management is shifting their focus back to the refining business.

Elliott has significant experience in partnering with industry experts and has already identified candidates here with relevant expertise to fill two board seats. Elliott is not asking for a board seat for itself to debate with management. The firm is asking for two seats for two industry executives who would put management in the best position to execute on their plan. The best activists use board seats to support management in executing their plan but they also will hold management accountable if they are unable to do so.

That is where Elliott's plan B comes into play. If Phillips 66 adds two new directors approved by Elliott and still cannot deliver on performance targets over the next year then it will need to take a path like the one Marathon Petroleum took in its transformation. This will include making appropriate management changes closing the current $2 to $3 per barrel refining EBITDA gap between Phillips 66 and Valero and generating $15 billion to $20 billion from the sale of non-core assets including their CPChem stake European convenience stores and a portion of non-operated midstream stakes.

This should be an easy decision for the company and we would expect it to quickly appoint two new directors identified by Elliott to the board. Given the tone and substance of Elliott's outreach it would be very surprising and disappointing to see this go to a proxy fight. However if it did we believe Elliott would be a lock to get at least two board seats on the 13-person board particularly with the use of a universal proxy card.

(AWS) a subsidiary of Amazon.com Inc. unveiled Amazon One Enterprise a palm-based identity service designed to enhance organizational security and prevent costly security breaches. This new service is set to revolutionize the hotel industry by providing a fast convenient and contactless experience for guests and staff to access physical locations such as hotels and resorts as well as digital assets like restricted software resources.

Traditional methods of authentication such as badges PINs and passwords have long been used by hotels to grant access to buildings and software resources. However these methods have common security vulnerabilities. Badges can be lost shared cloned or stolen while PINs and passwords are easily forgotten guessable or shared. Amazon One Enterprise aims to eliminate these issues reducing operational overhead associated with the management of traditional authentication methods.

Amazon One Enterprise is a fully managed service that provides highly accurate and secure access control through an easy-to-use biometric identification device. The service combines palm and vein imagery for biometric matching and reportedly delivers an accuracy rate of 99.9999% exceeding the accuracy of other biometric alternatives. The palm-recognition technology uses advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning to create a palm signature that is associated with identification credentials like a badge employee ID or PIN.

The introduction of Amazon One Enterprise into the hotel industry could significantly enhance the guest experience. It replaces the need for multiple authentication methods allowing guests and staff to use their palm to access physical spaces and digital assets. To begin a user can enroll by hovering their palm over an Amazon One enrollment device and associating their palm with their organization’s preferred ID—such as badges PINs and passwords—and this can be done in less than a minute.

Protecting the privacy of these users is a foundational element of Amazon One Enterprise. The new service is designed to ensure palm images user credentials and other metadata are immediately encrypted using industry-leading encryption technology and sent to a dedicated Amazon One Enterprise service account in the AWS Cloud with all of the security and isolation features of AWS.

Amazon One Enterprise is currently available in preview in the United States and hospitality organizations are expressing keen interest viewing the technology as a more secure efficient way to manage authentication and access their systems. Among them is IHG Hotels & Resorts the global hospitality company with over 6000 hotels in more than 100 countries which will begin piloting the technology next year.

“We are excited to work with Amazon One Enterprise for a more secure efficient way to manage authentication and access our systems” said Nick Krieble global head of Identity and Access Management IHG in a press statement. “With Amazon One Enterprise our goal is to offer employees a new and convenient way to identify themselves and gain access to our software systems by hovering their palm over the Amazon One device. This approach will streamline the way we authenticate give staff access to the tools they need and make access easier than ever for them.”

Boon Edam a leading manufacturer of revolving doors security doors and security turnstiles sees Amazon One Enterprise as a way to offer authorized entrances using innovative palm biometric technology that raises their security bar and delivers a convenient workplace experience. Paznic a security company that specializes in technology that simplifies and modernizes the way financial institutions manage access control and safety deposit boxes is also looking forward to launching Amazon One Enterprise across their locations.

Amazon One Enterprise represents a potentially large shift in how hotels manage access control. By replacing traditional authentication methods with a highly accurate and secure biometric identification device hotels can enhance the guest experience improve security and reduce operational overhead. As the service is rolled out the industry will be watching closely to see how it is adopted and what impact it has on the hospitality industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRlZmx5ZXIuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMDMvd2luLWEtbWVtb3JhYmxlLXN0YXktYXQtc2hlcmF0b24tbWFsZGl2ZXMtZnVsbC1tb29uLXJlc29ydC1zcGEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Win a memorable stay at Sheraton Maldives Full Moon Resort & Spa,"Time flies – it is the time of the year again!

Equally important but perhaps not as well-represented are the other fundamental elements of COP28 – specifically inclusion of the youth women and frontline communities.

These are crucial segments of society that need addressing Renee McGowan CEO of Marsh McLennan India Middle East and Africa tells Sustainability magazine on the second day of COP28 at Expo City in Dubai.

The world’s leading professional services firm in the areas of risk strategy and people and with more than 85000 colleagues advising clients in 130 countries Marsh McLennan is joining government and private-sector leaders at COP28 – with experts advisors and doers across all four of its businesses – Marsh Guy Carpenter Mercer and Oliver Wyman – sharing a range of actionable solutions that empower more sustainable futures.

As the regional CEO for Marsh McClennan McGowan is one of the experts on the ground at COP – and inclusion of youth women and communities is a topic close to her heart.

Passionate about financial inclusion girls’ education and advancing women in society McGowan mentors entrepreneurs in developing nations as part of the Cherie Blair Foundation’s Mentoring Women in Business Programme. She is also a mentor with StreetWise a non-profit that empowers unemployed individuals with skills and resources and is a member of the Dubai Business Women Council and of Chief Executive Women.

“Right from the start the President-Designate Dr Sultan Al Jaber of the UAE has been clear on the commitment to make COP28 an inclusive and safe space for all participants” says Dubai-based McGowan who is one of Marsh McLennan’s experts on the ground at COP28.

“Inclusivity is a critical enabler to achieving transformative progress across the climate agenda and that only by rising above our differences and working together can we raise our shared ambition and deliver progress.”

McGowan believes that now is the time for boldness in thinking and action on inclusion and empowerment issues that can positively affect this region for generations to come ""placing people at the heart of the conversation and empowering them to be the best they can possibly be wherever they may live in the region"".

We sat down with McGowan hear to hear her views on these three critical segments of society.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAzL2lzLXdhcnJlbi1idWZmZXR0cy1yZWNlbnQtc3RvY2stc2VsbGluZy1zZW5kaW5nLWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is Warren Buffett's Recent Stock Selling Sending a Silent Warning to This Industry?,"Berkshire Hathaway sold several portfolio holdings in the third quarter including a significant amount from this one industry.

Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.65%) (BRK.B -0.72%) has been an excellent stock for longtime investors. Since Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett took Berkshire's reins in 1965 Buffett and his team have delivered phenomenal returns of 19.8% compounded annually. These returns have crushed the S&P 500 index which has delivered investors a solid 9.9% annual return in the same period.

The conglomerate's success is a big reason investors pay close attention to its 13F filing showing its buying and selling activity in a given quarter. The Securities and Exchange Commission requires this filing from institutional investors and it can provide us with some insights into what the best and brightest on Wall Street are doing.

In the third quarter Berkshire reduced its stake in several stocks many of which were long-term holdings. Included in the selling activity were several insurance stocks. Could this selling be a silent warning to the industry? Let's dig in and find out.

Berkshire Hathaway's selling included several insurance stocks

Buffett is a longtime fan of owning insurance companies and has previously said that insurance companies are ""a very large chunk of Berkshire's value."" Buffett credits his first insurance investment in National Indemnity in 1967 for helping turn around Berkshire Hathaway an ailing textile maker. Today the company owns several insurers including GEICO General Re Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance and Alleghany.

Given Buffett's affinity for insurance it was a little surprising to see Berkshire Hathaway dumping shares of several insurance companies during the past two quarters. In the second quarter Berkshire sold its position in Marsh & McLennan the insurance broker and workplace advisor it initially purchased in 2020.

Berkshire also sold 5.5 million shares of Globe Life or about 87% of its total position coming into the year. Globe Life the life insurer known as Torchmark until 2019 has been a part of Berkshire's portfolio since 2001. It also sold shares in Markel (312946 shares or 66% of its stake) and Aon (235000 shares or 5% of its stake) in the quarter.

Here's one reason Buffett and his team may have sold insurers

It's possible that Buffett and his team including Todd Combs and Ted Weschler don't see as much upside in insurance stocks. Like many industries the insurance business is cyclical. However it doesn't necessarily follow the typical business cycle. Instead insurers go through cycles depending on the claims costs and competition in the marketplace.

Insurers have dealt with rising claims costs for several years resulting in a ""hard"" insurance market. In this environment insurers must raise premiums to cover those rising claims costs. Additionally fewer insurers are competing for business allowing these companies to raise premiums without losing too much business. Claims costs have risen for several reasons including increasing climate-related disasters inflationary pressures and increased litigation against insurers.

According to Marsh & McLennan's Globe Insurance Market Index which measures global commercial insurance premium pricing change at renewal pricing increases for insurers have gradually come down since peaking amid the pandemic and could be signs of a softening insurance market.

Experts expect the pricing environment for insurers to continue softening. Reinsurance or insurance that insurers buy to protect themselves against catastrophic losses can be a good indicator of the overall pricing environment for insurance companies. Fitch Ratings expects reinsurance rates to continue rising in 2024 albeit slower than this year with prices falling in 2025.

Investors shouldn't be too concerned about Berkshire's selling

A slowdown in price increases is a welcome sign for individuals and businesses which have seen premiums rise significantly since the early days of the pandemic. For insurers it means they won't be able to grow quite as quickly and may have to compete among each other for business in a less favorable pricing environment. If insurers sell off from here it could be an intriguing opportunity for investors.

Kinsale Capital is one insurer that has performed well. While its valuation is a little higher if the stock were to sell off much from here it could be an excellent stock to buy the dip on. Progressive is another example of an outstanding insurance stock that has performed well for decades because of its long-term commitment to underwriting profitable policies. Finally Marsh & McLennan's business has performed well across multiple recessions since 1962.

For insurance stock investors I wouldn't be too concerned about Berkshire's selling activity. The conglomerate still holds several private insurance companies including GEICO and Alleghany. However Berkshire's selling is a good reminder to invest in high-quality insurers that can perform well across different cycles.",,,,,,,,,

It was under the Absa Bank Ghana Limited and the Mastercard Foundation “Ready to work” initiative which provided the beneficiaries with the requisite soft skills needed for the world of work.

The summit equipped the youth with skills to find ways of working together and understanding people’s emotions help manage their finances efficiently and achieve their entrepreneurial and business goals.

It also served as a platform for the youth to voice out their challenges and offer solutions to policy decision makers should consider in national development plans and youth-centred policies.

In an interview with the Ghana News Agency Nana Essilfuah Tamakloe Director Marketing and Corporate Affairs Absa Bank Ghana LTD said the training was to hear and empower the youth to actively participate in economic activities.

A 2022 Ghana Statistical Service report indicated that while young people and children constituted about 73 per cent of the country’s population one out of every five young people between the ages of 15 to 35 was not in education employment or actively involved in training.

That Nana Essilfuah Tamakloe said made it important for engagements that would ultimately lead to quality improvement in the lives of young people and enable them to contribute meaningfully to national development.

She said that beyond the two-day training the Absa ReadytoWork App would provide continuous career guidance to provide insight into the world of work the jobs of the future and the skills needed to fulfil them.

There would also be a job search tool that would enable them to search for their dream jobs as well as tools articles and videos and other resources to make them tap into opportunities in the digital world.

Mr Mustapha Ussif Minister Youth and Sports lauded the two institutions for the summit which he said would help support government initiatives in shaping the youth of the country for the future.

He said the National Entrepreneurship and Innovation Programme (NEIP) Free Senior High School (Free SHS) YouStart and the Youth in Agriculture programme were tangible manifestations of government’s commitment to empowering Ghanaian youth.

He said: “Our government firmly believes in the potential of our youth as catalysts for innovation and progress. Your talents and skills are not only valuable assets but indispensable forces driving our nation’s development.”

He encouraged the youth to be fearless in seeking for a better world saying “your active participation in economic decisions affecting your livelihoods is paramount”.

Speaking at the summit Rica Rwigamba Ghana Country Director Mastercard Foundation bemoaned Ghana’s high rate of unemployment and called for concerted effort to address it.

She said it was important to ignite conversations among various stakeholders to better understand contextualised listen and help tackle youth unemployment for economic prosperity.

The qualifiers started in March and conclude in November before March’s play-offs to determine the final 24 competing teams.

There was record ticket demand for Euro 2020 with the tournament attracting 28.3million ticket requests and next summer’s tournament has proved to be similarly popular.

This is not without its controversy with supporter disappointment at missing out on tickets during the first round of balloting compounded by tickets then swiftly appearing on resale sites for substantially inflated prices.

The Athletic has the lowdown on the Euro 2024 ticketing situation.

When Euro 2024 tickets go on sale and how to buy them

Over 1.2million tickets were made available in the first round of Euro 2024 ticket applications which ran from October 3 to October 26 2023. Tickets were allocated via a UEFA portal lottery process. Applicants could apply for a maximum of four tickets per match and individuals were not awarded tickets for different matches scheduled for the same day. Applicants applied for a total average of 13 tickets. Successful applicants were informed on November 14.

Those who were unsuccessful in their applications in the initial draw have been automatically entered in UEFA’s “Fans First” programme and will be alerted to new ticket availability from the first lottery phase.

The second ticket ballot will open after the tournament draw on December 2 2023. One million tickets will be available to supporters from the 21 qualified nations. Supporters will apply for tickets via their national association before making their purchase through UEFA’s website. These will typically be allocated to members of national associations’ supporter groups and be distributed using a loyalty points based system.

Details of where to apply via each national association can be found at https://www.uefa.com/euro2024/ticketing/

Tickets will also be held back for supporters of the three nations that qualify through the Euro 2024 play-offs — three from Poland Estonia Wales Finland Israel Iceland Bosnia and Herzegovina Ukraine Georgia Luxembourg Greece and Kazakhstan. The play-offs take place on March 21 and March 26 2024.

UEFA will open a ticket resale platform in spring 2024. This will enable fans to purchase unwanted tickets at resale value and is part of UEFA’s attempts to combat fraudulent ticket sales.

Is the process different to previous tournaments?

At previous tournaments supporters would register for tickets directly via UEFA’s website even after the group stage draw. The allocation process was still conducted in collaboration with national associations.

Supporters applying for Euro 2024 tickets via the second ticket ballot which takes place after the group stage draw instead register through their national association.

How much do Euro 2024 tickets cost?

The cheapest tickets available for Euro 2024 are €30 (£26.24 $32.63) for the lowest category pricing of group stage fixtures. A total of 270000 tickets are priced at €30.

All group stage tickets range from €30 to €200 (£174.91 $217) apart from the opening game at Bayern Munich’s Munich Football Arena where tickets range from €50 (£42.73 $54.39) to €600 (£524.79 $652.64).

Tickets for the knockout stages range from €50 for the cheapest round of 16 fixture to €600 for the most expensive category 1 semi-final ticket.

Prices for the final which takes place at Berlin’s Olympiastadion range from €90 (£78.71 $97.90) to €1000 (£874.58 $1087.73).

Group Stage Opening match Round of 16 Quarter-final Semi-final Final Fans First €30 €50 €50 €60 €80 €95 Category 3 €60 €195 €85 €100 €195 €300 Category 2 €150 €400 €175 €200 €400 €600 Category 1 €200 €600 €250 €300 €600 €1000

Have there been any problems?

Given demand a number of supporters missed out on tickets in the initial ballot. UEFA confirmed it received over 20million “genuine” ticket requests for the first round of sales where over 1.2million tickets were made available. Over 2.2million tickets were requested for the final — 33 times the size of the Olympiastadion’s 74000 capacity.

Tickets have since appeared on resale websites for heavily inflated prices. One platform claimed to have 20 tickets for the final priced at £43500-per-ticket — 49 times their face value. The resale or advertisement of resale of tickets is strictly prohibited by UEFA.

UEFA did identify bots during the ticketing request process but claim to have taken them out of the lottery. The use of bots or any computer software to increase a user’s chance of their application being successful is a breach of UEFA’s ticketing terms and conditions.

Hosts Germany will face Scotland in the opening match of Euro 2024 in Munich while defending champions Italy have been drawn in the same group as Spain.

The Germans three-time winners will kick off the one-month tournament on June 14 with the final on July 14 in Berlin’s Olympic stadium.

The draw was held on Saturday at the Elbphilharmonie concert hall in Hamburg one of the 10 host cities of the tournament.

Germany will also face Hungary and Switzerland in Group A.

Italy face a tough task in defending their title drawn in Group B with Spain Croatia and Albania.

France and the Netherlands will face each other again after coming through the qualifying campaign in the same group drawn in Group D alongside Austria and the winner of playoff A.

England beaten finalists in Euro 2020 are in Group C alongside Denmark Slovenia and Serbia.

Group E sees Belgium take on Romania Slovakia and the winners of playoff B while Group F features Portugal Turkey the Czech Republic and the playoff C winners.

The hosts qualified automatically and 20 teams have advanced through the European qualifiers. Three teams are still unknown and will come through the playoffs in March.

The top two in each of the six Euro 2024 groups proceed to the round of 16 along with the four best third-placed finishers.

In the semifinal playoffs on March 21 Poland will face Estonia and Wales will take on Finland in path A.

In path B Israel will play against Iceland while Bosnia and Herzegovina will face Ukraine.

In path C Georgia will take on Luxembourg and Greece will play against Kazakhstan.

The playoff finals will be on March 26.

The draw ceremony was disrupted by unexplained noises that competed for attention with the team names being read out on stage.

The interruption which seemed to sound like sexual noises was clearly heard for several minutes on the ceremony broadcast from a concert hall in Hamburg.

UEFA Director of Competitions Giorgio Marchetti noted the noise in his commentary before continuing with the draw for the last six places for lower-ranked teams in the 24-nation tournament lineup. The noises continued sporadically until the draw was completed.

Similar noises disrupted a BBC live broadcast of an English football game in January between Wolves and Liverpool. It turned out to be a prank use of a mobile phone next to the studio.

The race which the nonpartisan Cook Political Report says “leans Democratic” is one of several that could determine which party controls the Senate.

Bob Casey is outperforming Joe Biden

While Casey and McCormick are running closely in the state Casey is also outrunning his party’s presidential nominee President Joe Biden.

Casey outruns President Joe Biden by 2 percentage points when voters are asked about a two-person race between Biden and former President Donald Trump. When third-party presidential candidates including Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are included in the mix Casey outruns Biden by a much larger 10 points.

“I don’t really know a lot about Bob Casey but I haven’t heard anything bad about Bob Casey” said Charles Kestener 41 a registered independent from Allentown who plans to vote for Casey but not Biden.

Kestener a truck driver criticized Biden’s handling of the economy and the military withdrawal from Afghanistan. He said he would support Green Party candidate Jill Stein in the presidential race over either major party candidate.

Casey leads McCormick with women and voters who identify as independents as well as young voters and non-white voters two groups that have drifted away from Biden in the state.

“People know the Casey family” said Eric Stern former deputy campaign manager for Sen. John Fetterman. “They know Sen. Casey extremely well and even if their feelings about national Democrats gets colder … They don’t necessarily hold the senator responsible for their feelings on the economy or national issues or inflation.”

Still Stern said he expects the gap to shrink between Casey and Biden two longtime political allies. “There just aren’t enough swing voters anymore. Even if Casey runs the best campaign in the world he’s not gonna outpace Biden by 10 points.”

Trump outruns McCormick in a head-to-head presidential matchup and pulls in similar support when voters are asked about third-party candidates.

GOP political consultant Vince Galko who worked on both of former Sen. Pat Toomey’s reelection campaigns said if McCormick can outrun Trump in more suburban areas where he currently trails Casey by a large margin that could pay dividends.

“He can go after independents and swing voters in the suburbs that Trump’s not gonna get” Galko said. “He’s got his military background and economic message so it doesn’t even have to be big numbers but a point and a half could be huge in the Philly suburbs.”

Biden and Trump remain unpopular candidates in the state with 55% of registered voters disapproving of Trump and 57% unhappy with Biden.

Casey is polling favorably with 49% of voters compared to Biden who is favorable among 41% of voters. McCormick and Trump are even on favorability with 41% and 42% of voters considering them favorable candidates.

Mike Mikus a Democratic political consultant who has worked on Senate campaigns in the state said 49% favorability is a good sign for Casey.

“Those are really strong numbers in an environment like this for Democrats” Mikus said. “It’s gonna take a lot of money and effort to try to make Bob Casey an unfavorable figure in Pennsylvania That’s one of McCormick’s biggest challenges.”

McCormick remains relatively unknown by 34% of Pennsylvania voters

More Pennsylvanians view McCormick favorably (42%) than unfavorably (24%) but 34% either had not heard of him or had no opinion of him. That’s about 14 points higher than the 20% who did not know how they felt about Casey or said they had not heard of him.

It’s a sign that McCormick is still introducing himself to voters who may not remember him from the bruising 2022 GOP primary two years ago when even Trump was criticizing him.

And while Democrats have for months accused McCormick of being a carpetbagger who primarily lives in Connecticut it’s not clear by McCormick’s favorability numbers that those attacks have resonated.

It’s early in the campaign cycle and both campaigns are eventually expected to pour millions into ads to get their names and messages out in the state.

John Fetterman maintains support

Fetterman a Pennsylvania Democrat is not up for reelection but he’s frequently in the headlines for his boldly casual political style and staunch support for Israel.

The senator isn’t afraid to make waves and voters seem split on how they feel about that. Fetterman’s overall favorability rating was at 48% just 1 percentage point lower than Casey his quieter U.S. Senate counterpart. An additional 41% of registered voters had unfavorable views of Fetterman.

Fetterman a freshman senator is slightly better known than Casey with just 6% of voters saying they haven’t heard of him.

Stern Fetterman’s former campaign manager said that’s no surprise for the heavily covered Democrat:

“John Fetterman takes out the trash and there’s three news articles about it.”

Stock Value: Purchased

Reasoning: The Steelers used their fourth-round draft pick to take a third offensive lineman in Mason McCormick. One could argue the sheer volume indicates how highly they value McCormick relative to other positions of need. They passed on some defensive backs to draft a player who has virtually no shot of playing this year. But perhaps they see him as a potential future starter for the long haul.

Odds are Mason McCormick begins his career as a backup. But he’ll have ample opportunity to dictate or at least influence how things progress from there. The Steelers already tipped their hand in how they drafted him and what they said about him: they’re big fans.

You have to be a big fan of an offensive lineman to draft him in the fourth round after already drafting linemen in the first two rounds. After all the Steelers never did anything like that before in their history. But they seem to believe Mason McCormick could be a starter sooner or later. Perhaps sooner rather than later. General manager Omar Khan seemed to go out of his way to highlight next offseason. Both starting James Daniels and reserve Nate Herbig are pending unrestricted free agents. Could McCormick step into the starting lineup for Daniels by then? They seem open to it.

After all it’s not like they don’t have plenty of tape. He played something like 3400 snaps in college if my memory is correct. He’s older he’s mature he’s humble he’s loyal he’s dedicated. He’s the kind of offensive lineman that you want to have on your team. That’s why they drafted him even though the line room seemed pretty full already.

At the other guard spot is Isaac Seumalo who is on the wrong side of 30. Even if they were to end up re-signing Daniels Seumalo isn’t going to play forever either. But McCormick first has to prove himself on the field before any of this conversation matters. Yeah they liked him but now he has to justify it.

Still Mason McCormick seems like an easy player to root for. And in terms of immediacy he could at least challenge for the top interior reserve role. He played guard generally but is center-capable so he could theoretically make Herbig expendable.

As the season progresses Steelers players’ stocks rise and fall. The nature of the evaluation differs with the time of year with in-season considerations being more often short-term. Considerations in the offseason often have broader implications particularly when players lose their jobs or the team signs someone. This time of year is full of transactions whether minor or major.

A bad game a new contract an injury a promotion—any number of things affect a player’s value. Think of it as a stock on the market based on speculation. You’ll feel better about a player after a good game or worse after a bad one. Some stock updates are minor while others are likely to be quite drastic so bear in mind the degree. I’ll do my best to explain the nature of that in the reasoning section of each column.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxvY2toYXZlbi5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzLzIwMjQvMDUvc2VuYXRlLWNhbmRpZGF0ZS1kYXZlLW1jY29ybWljay1tYWtlcy1zdG9wLWluLWNsaW50b24tY291bnR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Senate candidate Dave McCormick makes stop in Clinton County,"McELHATTAN — U.S. Senate Candidate Dave McCormick recently visited Restless Oaks to meet with constituents.

At least that’s what the Pittsburgh Steelers’ fourth-round draft pick credits for his own sense of loyalty.

An FCS football player out of the Missouri Valley Football Conference’s South Dakota State Jackrabbits McCormick faced the same challenges as any small-school prospect. No matter how well you dominate your competition you’re always asked who did you beat? Such questions often cap their potential to the middle rounds of the draft.

A lot of times NFL-worthy prospects from small schools must answer those questions in Bowl games and practices. Arguably fewer small-school players make it this far because those who have that talent enter the transfer portal. They end up changing schools where they can raise their profile. McCormick never did despite the opportunity to do so and he explained why.

“Yes I had offers. The temptation was not there” he told reporters on Friday via the team’s website. “South Dakota State gave so much to me and developed me into who I am now. Who am I to leave South Dakota State? They poured so much into me. I feel like they should be able to reap the benefits of what they helped create. Sure some money would be cool or whatever but it’s just ultimately my loyalties lie with the people that are good to me.”

Reporters asked him questions in the same vein after the draft and he gave the same answer. “I feel like in today’s world loyalty is kind of an afterthought” he said at the time via 93.7 The Fan. “South Dakota State did so much for me it was a no-brainer for me to be loyal to them.”

McCormick first arrived at South Dakota State in 2018 redshirting his first season as a zero-star prospect from Sioux Falls. He managed two starts the following season before the COVID-19 pandemic wiped out his redshirt sophomore year. In all he spent six years there logging comfortably over 3000 career snaps on the offensive line.

We’ll see how loyalty influences McCormick’s relationship with the Pittsburgh Steelers moving forward. He has a chance to earn a starting job though not as a rookie. They drafted him after taking linemen in the first two rounds precisely for that reason. If he does crack the starting lineup will he show loyalty to the Steelers when he hits free agency?

That doesn’t mean taking a cheap contract because business is always a part of the equation. But for some more than others so are our core values. McCormick credits his family for the emphasis he puts on loyalty.

“I think that’s just the way I was raised” he said. “People that are good to you you should be great to them and give back to them. That’s just the way it’s always been for me.”

Loyalty. It’s an easy talk to talk but try walking it and most will fall on their face. McCormick stayed loyal to South Dakota State and it served him well to get this far."

Back in April McDonald’s announced plans to make several “tasty improvements” not only to its Big Macs but nearly its entire burger lineup outlining recipe tweaks and new cooking practices intended to produce juicier patties and more flavorful food.

Among the changes McDonald’s announced plans to introduce a cooking process to produce more “perfectly melted cheese” and new toasted buns that are “softer” and more “pillowy” than previous iterations. The overhauled burgers are also said to have additional “caramelized flavor” achieved by adding the onions to the meat on the grill rather than scattering them atop the cooked patties.

The Big Macs too would have even more Big Mac sauce McDonald’s said at the time.

But this week the Wall Street Journal revealed additional details obtained through internal memos and company insiders hinting at a much more extensive overhaul than McDonald’s initially announced.

Among the “more than 50 tweaks” the Wall Street Journal learned of McDonald’s will use brioche buns for its burgers with Big Mac buns getting a smattering of “randomly scattered” sesame seeds to lend a not-so-uniform appearance. The patties themselves are also cooked in smaller batches for a better sear and more juiciness and room-temperature cheese will be used — rather than cheese from a cooler — so that it melts better.

The new burgers are also designed to be “hotter” a McDonald’s chef told WSJ at the company’s headquarters earlier this year.

“We found that small changes like tweaking our process to get hotter meltier cheese and adjusting our grill settings for a better sear added up to a big difference in making our burgers more flavorful than ever” Chad Schafer the company’s senior director of culinary innovation said in a McDonald’s press release issued in April.

At the time McDonald’s said its changes would affect Big Macs McDoubles and its classic hamburgers and cheeseburgers but did not mention whether its Quarter Pounders would be affected. A representative for McDonald’s did not provide additional details when contacted by Nexstar.

If customers have noticed their Big Macs and burgers tasting differently as of late it’s likely because McDonald’s had already debuted the changes in specific markets earlier this year including Boise Denver Las Vegas Los Angeles Phoenix Portland Sacramento Salt Lake City San Francisco Seattle and Tucson. (Restaurants in Australia Belgium and Canada were the first to standardize the changes prior to their introduction in the U.S.) The plan now as previously announced by McDonald’s is to continue the rollout to all restaurants in the U.S. in 2024 — or early 2024 according to WSJ.

The Hamburglar too will herald the nationwide availability of the new burgers in an upcoming commercial campaign McDonald’s wrote in the April press release.

Thinly cut and perfectly salted practically everyone can agree that McDonald's french fries are delicious — in fact they're the fast food chain's best-selling item. Thanks to a Disney-McDonald's partnership this hot-and-crispy snack was once sought after in Disney's theme parks but unfortunately the Golden Arches' fries at Disney parks are now a memory of the distant past.

Guests who strolled through Disneyland (or Disney World) enjoying fresh McDonald's french fries haven't been able to do so since 2008. In 1998 the companies' business partnership formed and they developed a contract in which McDonald's would promote Disney content and in exchange the restaurant chain could open locations inside and around Disney parks. In accordance with these terms McDonald's french fry stands began popping up all over the parks kicking off a solid 10-year run. In 2007 however Disney chose not to renew the contract and much to the sadness of french fry fans all traces of McDonald's disappeared from the parks in 2008.

Chain Food Isn't Common Inside Disney Parks

Burger Invasion storefront in Disney park - @coheteboy/Instagram

Prior to 2008 the U.S. Disney parks featured many locations where guests could enjoy fries and other McDonald's food. Disneyland in Anaheim California had the ""Westward Ho!"" covered wagon in Frontierland which sold ""Potato Food"" aka french fries. California Adventure the park across from Disneyland had a full-fledged restaurant called ""Burger Invasion"" which offered a small burger menu in addition to McDonald's fries. Inside Disney World's much more expansive Florida parks were six locations where guests could find McDonald's fries and food (via Yesterland). Today you can find a solar-powered McDonald's at Disney World and although it's outside the actual parks it holds the impressive title of the first net-zero McDonald's.

Since the removal of McDonald's from the parks only one other food chain has operated inside Disney's walls: Starbucks. However like the old McDonald's food stands Disney doesn't make its Starbucks locations outwardly obvious giving the storefronts themed names and blending them seamlessly into each park's environment. The first Disney Starbucks called ""Fiddler Fifer and Practical Cafe"" opened in California Adventure in 2012 and the second dubbed ""Market House"" popped up on Disneyland's Main Street one year later. These locations are different from regular Starbucks in that they don't allow mobile ordering via the Starbucks app and customers can't use their Starbucks Rewards. Regardless these locations offer the same spread of drinks as any other Starbucks.

Kenneth Mosby of the 8800 block of South Burley Avenue has been charged with one felony count of attempted first-degree murder and one felony count of aggravated battery/discharge of a firearm.

According to a police report Mosby is the father of the girl critically wounded in the shooting.

The shooting happened just before 11 p.m. Tuesday when the mother of the 9-month-old girl went into a McDonald’s at 70 E. Garfield Blvd. and left the child in the car with her boyfriend according to police.

When she came out and got into the driver’s seat she peered into her rear-view mirror and spotted blood coming from the baby’s nose but “thought nothing of it” as the baby had been fighting a cold a police report said.

The woman then got out of her car opened the back door and saw the baby was bleeding “profusely” so she jumped behind the wheel and drove to Comer Children’s Hospital according to the report.

The child was listed in critical condition with gunshot wounds below her right ear and above her left eyebrow.

Earlier this week police were speaking with a person of interest who they said had been released without being charged.

Community activist Andrew Holmes welcomed the arrest but was still searching for answers Friday.

“We’re still pushing forward because with the way things have been going in the state of Illinois they may have a person of interest in custody and that person may walk out tonight or tomorrow so we’re still going to push and ask for information” Holmes said.

He said he planned to reach out to the girl’s parents Friday.

Also Friday Holmes called attention to the June 2022 shooting death of 5-month-old Cecilia Thomas offering a $1000 reward to anyone with information that leads to the conviction in that shooting.

“I talked with both the mother and father (of Cecilia) and they’re still suffering because nothing’s solved and nobody’s been arrested” Holmes said.

Thomas was in her car seat with her dad driving in the 7700 block of South Shore Drive when someone in another car pulled up and fired shots striking the girl in her head.

“For anybody to get shot that’s disrespectful but for a little baby that doesn’t know anything about guns? Come on man” Holmes said.

He’s continuing to seek information in the shootings of both children.

“We need to close these cases out because it’s heartbreaking” Holmes said. “Their brains were not functionally strong yet and here they have a bullet lodged in their head — we have one deceased and one fighting for her life.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vaHlwZWJlYXN0LmNvbS8yMDIzLzEyL21jZG9uYWxkcy1jb3NtY3Mtc3Bpbm9mZi1yZXN0YXVyYW50LXByZXZpZXctbWVuddIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Take a First Look at McDonald's 'CosMc's' Spinoff Restaurant,"McDonald’s was reported earlier this year to be opening a spinoff restaurant called CosMc’s according to Food Beast.

A user on X has now posted a photo of the newly-established CosMc’s which is billed to offer McDonald’s classics alongside a roster of totally new food and beverage options.

“The concept is being launched in Bollingbrook IL” Iman Jalali wrote on X. “[A] whole new menu of items we’ve never seen before.”

According to Jalali’s photos the menu will include chai frappes pear slushies turmeric spiced latte and berry lemonades. It’ll also be making spicy queso sandwiches and a tomatillo slider among other food items. The X user observed seeing actors outside of the location filming a commercial so CosMc’s most likely isn’t fully open to the public just yet."

“We are concerned that certain syringes manufactured in China may not provide consistent and adequate quality or performance” FDA said in a statement.

Not naming any specific companies the agency said it had received information about quality issues associated with several Chinese manufacturers of plastic syringes including leaks breakage and other problems and recommended that consumers healthcare providers and facilities not use syringes manufactured in the country if possible. If a user only has access to syringes manufactured in China FDA said to continued use as needed until alternative syringes become available but to closely monitor for leaks breakage and other problems. The agency also said it has received Medical Device Reports and other complaints about plastic syringes including problems after manufacturers changed syringe dimensions.

FDA said it is working with federal partners to test syringes manufactured in China as well as manufacturers to ensure adequate corrective actions are being taken. If necessary non-adherence to FDA’s actions may result in the prevention of Chinese-made syringes entering the United States.

The safety communication comes two weeks after the agency issued Class I recall notices to both Cardinal Health and Fresenius Medical care in relation to disposable syringes listing similar quality issues noted in the statement such as leaks and changes to syringe dimensions.

The Cardinal recall pertained to its Monoject single use Luer Lock Syringes which were part of Coviden’s portfolio that the company bought from Medtronic in 2017. In June Cardinal changed the branding of the syringes changing it from Coviden to Cardinal Health. The branding however changed the dimensions of the syringe leading to the recall.

The differing dimensions reportedly affected their use with syringe pumps potentially resulting in pump performance issues like overdose underdose delay in therapy and delays in occlusion alarms. The company has received 15 reports of delayed therapy due to syringe infusion pumps not recognizing syringes and 13 reports of inaccurate volume/rate dispensing including some injuries.

Fresenius also saw its recall marked as Class I after it was found that the Sanxin Single Use Sterile Syringes had the potential to leak blood or heparin back or from the syringe. There were also reports of an unknown black material inside the syringe. Use of the syringes according to FDA could cause serious adverse health consequences including sepsis and blood loss due to leakage or risks like incorrect heparin dosage.

Of note the warning does not currently include glass or pre-filled syringes.

The notice has sparked some companies to issue a statement reiterating that the FDA warning does not impact their products as they are not manufactured in China.

Embecta BD’s diabetes business spinoff is one such company which felt the need to clarify its manufacturing location. In a statement the company noted that it manufactures all of its syringes for worldwide distribution at its Holdrege Nebraska facility according to Shaun Curtis senior vice president of global manufacturing and supply chain.

“The safety notice issued by the FDA on November 30 2023 only applies to plastic syringes made in China and therefore has no impact on the ongoing production or sale of any Embecta syringe products” he said.

Additionally the statement said the company is prepared to support a potential influx of customers affected by FDA’s safety communication.

“Our skilled workforce in Nebraska with its unmatched expertise in high volume syringe manufacturing is prepared to support any healthcare customers who may be affected by the FDA’s safety communication” Curtis said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpb3NwZWN0cnVtYXNpYS5jb20vYW5hbHlzaXMvMjUvMjMzODkvaG93LWhhcy0yMDIzLXBhbm5lZC1vdXQtZm9yLXRoZS1saWZlLXNjaWVuY2VzLWluZHVzdHJ5LWluLWFzaWEtcGFjaWZpYy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How has 2023 panned out for the life sciences industry in Asia Pacific?,"Many of the trends in 2023 in life sciences in Asia Pacific were predicted but there have been some unexpected events which have caught market participants off-guard.

In 2018 China introduced VBP for pharmaceuticals as an attempt to reduce the price of pharmaceuticals and in 2019 introduced VBP for medical devices. Under VBP Chinese Provinces tender out the supply of products on a large-scale. Procurement decisions have shifted from individual clinicians to hospital administrators. This has resulted in price cuts of 70 per cent and a shift in market share from Western manufacturers to Chinese manufacturers. Nevertheless Western-made products are considered by Chinese consumers to be higher quality than Chinese-made products. Recently some of the Chinese manufacturers are expanding sales into Asia-Pacific with reported success in New Zealand.

China plus one

A consequence of the pandemic and closed borders western companies are adding new manufacturing facilities in Vietnam or elsewhere to supplement existing manufacturing in China.

Regional headquarters (RHQ) for multinational life sciences companies (MNCs)

Singapore is the favourite location for a RHQ for MNCs ahead of its rivals in Hong Kong and Shanghai. 140000 people left Hong Kong from 2020 to 2022 including many executives who relocated from Hong Kong to Singapore. More recently with surging real estate costs in Singapore notably in the residential tenancy sector where rents have doubled in the last 1 to 2 years for expatriates some corporates are looking to return to Hong Kong or relocate some of their staff back to the city.

Government support for R&D and medical research

Governments have announced funding R&D and medical research particularly for vaccines. For example in May 2023 the Australian Federal Government committed to spending $4.5 billion over four years for medical research. The Australian Government also provides a generous R&D Tax Incentive to encourage companies to conduct R&D and clinical trials in Australia. In addition following the success of the mRNA vaccines for COVID-19 Australian State Governments have announced programmes to support the development of RNA research and manufacturing. It is hoped that viruses cancers and genetic diseases can be treated with RNA technologies.

In Japan the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (AMED) has established a centre for vaccine research to strengthen government response to an infectious disease emergency. With over 400 staff AMED’s budget in 2023 exceeds $800 million.

Global divestitures

There have been a number of large-scale divestitures with announcements up by 30 per cent year-on-year. Following high growth over the pandemic companies have reviewed their product lines and in some cases have decided to separate out non-core divisions. A number of pharma companies including Merck GSK Sanofi Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson have sold or spun off their consumer health divisions. Others have divested their off-patent portfolios and we have players in the distribution chain looking to snap these up as well private equity funds looking at pharma carve outs as they build up their operational due diligence skills. There has also been a wave of divestitures by medical device companies including Medtronic GE Healthcare and Baxter. Baker McKenzie has advised on many of these carve-outs and divestitures. A global trend the impact has been felt in Asia-Pacific with companies restructured and new players emerging such as Haleon and Kenvue.

Funding drought

2023 has been a difficult year for biotechs healthtechs and other companies seeking funding. Of course biotechs and the like are generally unsuitable for “bricks and mortar” traditional bank funding. We’ve seen macroeconomic headwinds stockmarket volatility and spiking interest rates. The IPO market has been extremely quiet across Asia-Pacific. Moreover venture capital and private equity investment and deal value globally have declined by 30 per cent. The global private equity industry ended 2022 with a record US$3.7 trillion in “dry powder” (uncommitted funds) and that amount has not been substantially reduced in 2023. In addition private equity sponsors have been looking at continuation funds as they try to find the right time to run the exit process. With expensive and hard to secure bank debt we are also seeing a rise in private credit as an alternative financing mechanism both from specialist providers but also as an additional product line from some sponsors.

From a deals perspective some markets in Asia have bucked the trend a little including in healthcare so whilst China/HKG may have been much quieter we see pockets of activity in Vietnam as well as India and a lot of interest in Indonesia but good assets at the right price are still challenging to find.

Quiet quitting

One of the consequences of the funding drought has been the shuttering of many biotechs and healthtechs around Asia-Pacific. I applaud the entrepreneurs who have given it a go and hope that many of the companies can spring back once funding improves.

Takeover opportunities

The Nasdaq biotech total return index was flat in 2021 down 10 per cent in 2022 and down 6 per cent to end September 2023. One consequence of the falling stock prices has been an increase in tender offers for publicly-traded biotechs by strategics. Many biotechs have sought advice on the steps to take were they to receive an unsolicited takeover offer. Those companies are also looking to enter into collaboration or licensing deals partly as a takeover defence.

The GLP-1 drug phenomenon

GLP-1 drugs such as Novo Nordisk's Ozempic are medicines which combat type 2 diabetes but also help in weight loss. Early trials also indicate that they may delay the progression of kidney disease in diabetes patients. This has affected a range of companies based in Asia-Pacific including those producing kidney disease treatments and those which treat sleep disorders. Those companies have said that they do not expect GLP-1 drugs to have a material impact on their business.

Artificial Intelligence

Of course a round-up of 2023 must mention AI. R&D for a new drug is notoriously time-consuming (sometimes taking up to 12 years) and expensive (circa $6 billion). By analysing data on disease pathology AI may short-cut the identification of the most promising new drugs. There are many companies employing AI in other fields too such as pathology and diagnostic imaging. For example I-MED Radiology and Harrison.ai use AI to support the identification of chest disease.

Following a high rate of adverse experience-related dropouts Merck called it quits Monday on a Phase III trial of its anti-TIGIT antibody vibostolimab and anti-PD-1 therapy Keytruda in skin cancer.

The late-stage study was evaluating vibostolimab as an adjuvant treatment to Keytruda in patients with resected high-risk melanoma. The investigational anti-TIGIT antibody works by restoring antitumor activity by blocking the TIGIT receptor from binding to its ligands to help T lymphocytes destroy tumor cells.

A pre-planned analysis revealed the high rate of dropouts primarily due to immune-mediated adverse events making it “highly unlikely that the trial could achieve a statistically significant improvement” in recurrence-free survival.

Based on the recommendation of an independent data monitoring committee Merck said it is unblinding the study to offer Keytruda alone to patients who had been receiving the combination treatment and sharing the results with the scientific community and regulatory agencies.

Keytruda is currently approved in two skin cancer indications for patients with metastatic or unresectable melanoma and as an adjuvant for certain stages following surgery. Merck continues efforts to move its blockbuster anti-PD-1 therapy up to an earlier line of treatment. The company is pursuing an ongoing Phase III study combining Keytruda with Moderna’s individualized neoantigen therapy V940 in patients with resected high-risk melanoma.

“We continue to ask the tough questions in an effort to fully explore the potential of novel coformulations and combinations that build on the foundation of Keytruda with a goal to improve upon current standards of care and help even more patients with cancer” Marjorie Green head of oncology for Merck Research Laboratories said in a statement.

The Keytruda-vibostolimab coformulation is in ongoing Phase III trials for lung cancer. Merck pointed out in Monday’s announcement that interim safety reviews have not resulted in any study modifications in these studies.

In December 2023 the company announced the combination treatment failed to meet endpoints in a Phase II study of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients with progressive disease after treatment with immunotherapy and chemotherapy.

Monday Merck & Co Inc (NYSE:MRK) announced the discontinuation of the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation arm of the Phase 3 KeyVibe-010 trial.

The trial evaluates the investigational coformulation of vibostolimab and Keytruda (pembrolizumab) compared to Keytruda alone as adjuvant treatment for patients with resected high-risk melanoma (Stage IIB-IV).

Also Read: Merck Stock Gains On Its Blockbuster Cancer Drug Keytruda Raises Annual Outlook.

Data from a pre-planned analysis showed that the primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival (RFS) met the pre-specified futility criteria.

A higher discontinuation rate of all adjuvant therapy by patients was observed in the coformulation arm versus the Keytruda-only arm primarily due to immune-mediated adverse experiences. Thus it is highly unlikely that the trial could achieve a statistically significant improvement in RFS.

Based on the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) Merck is unblinding the study and recommends that patients receiving the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation be offered the option to be treated with Keytruda monotherapy.

Data analysis from this study is ongoing.

Ongoing Phase 3 studies evaluating the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation in lung cancer include KeyVibe-003 KeyVibe-006 KeyVibe-007 and KeyVibe-008.

Interim external data monitoring committee safety reviews have not resulted in safety-related study modifications.

Last week Merck’s Phase 3 KEYNOTE-B21 trial of Keytruda in combination with chemotherapy as adjuvant treatment with or without radiotherapy did not meet its primary endpoint of disease-free survival (DFS) for newly diagnosed high-risk endometrial cancer patients after surgery with curative intent.

The study’s other primary endpoint of overall survival (OS) was not formally tested since DFS did not reach superiority.

(Reuters) -Merck said on Monday it had discontinued an experimental combination treatment testing a new type of immunotherapy in patients with a severe form of skin cancer after side effects led to high discontinuation.

This is the latest setback for the experimental drug vibostolimab and the related promising new class of immunotherapies called anti-TIGIT.

Merck was testing vibostolimab along with Keytruda its top-selling cancer drug in a late-stage study in patients with resected high-risk melanoma.

An analysis showed the trial will not achieve the main goal of statistically significant improvement in recurrence-free survival as more side effects led to several patients discontinuing the combination treatment versus those on Keytruda alone Merck said.

The company will recommend patients receiving the combination treatment be offered the Keytruda monotherapy.

Vibostolimab works by selectively binding itself to TIGIT a receptor on immune cells to activate the immune system against cancer cells.

Merck said it still had an extensive clinical development program evaluating the vibostolimab-Keytruda combination.

The combination treatment had earlier failed to significantly slow disease progression in lung cancer patients in a late-stage study last year.

Data from another trial in March last year had also showed that it was less effective than a generic medicine called docetaxel in some patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

Gilead Sciences Roche and GSK are among half a dozen drugmakers looking to grab a share of the lucrative anti-TIGIT cancer drug market but the field has seen multiple setbacks.

Gilead and its partner Arcus Biosciences in January stopped a late-stage trial involving their anti-TIGIT candidate domvanalimab in a type of lung cancer. Gilead has announced a $320 million investment in its biotech partner as it refocused its anti-TIGIT push.

Some advertisers who have pulled from the social media site are seeing some backlash from the boycotting.

Other social media sites and advertising tech companies stand to benefit from X losing advertisers.

Elon Musk's recent outburst against advertisers may hurt X (formerly Twitter) as brands take their advertising dollars elsewhere but it's not the only one facing backlash.

On the flip side those that stand to benefit include more than just X's social media competitors.

Musk slammed advertisers in an interview with the New York Times at its DealBook Summit Wednesday. He said brands that pulled their advertising dollars after he tweeted his support for an antisemitic conspiracy theory were trying to ""blackmail"" him.

Here's how the situation is playing out for different companies:



Walmart Joins Advertisers Leaving X

Retail giant Walmart (WMT) became the latest corporation to pull its advertising money from X on Friday Reuters reported in a growing movement that threatens the future of the platform.

Apple (AAPL) Warner Brothers (WBD) Comcast (CMCSA) and IBM (IBM) are among other firms draining the platform of its lifeblood.

Brands began distancing themselves from X after Musk took over last year but the exodus intensified after he tweeted supported an antisemitic conspiracy theory on Nov. 15 for which he has since apologized.

This episode has brought more focus on brand safety with advertisers becoming more cautious of the content that their ads are displayed in proximity to.

Disney Sees Some Initial Backlash

The Tesla (TSLA) and Space X founder has a loyal fanbase and the division between corporate ad spend and his defense of ""free speech"" has ramifications for his electric vehicle maker and a host of other firms.

The first company in the firing line is Disney (DIS) which pulled ads from the site after Musk's November tweets and curtailed posting on its main account.

Users on Musk's X platform were commenting in droves to say that they have or will drop the streaming site. Search interest on Google Trends shows a sharp increase in interest in canceling the company's Disney+ streaming subscription.

Iger spoke at the same Dealbook event and said his company's association with Musk or X ""was not a positive one for us.""

X's Monetization Woes May Worsen Significantly

X could lose up to $75 million in revenue by the end of the year as about 200 companies including Airbnb (ABNB) Amazon (AMZN) Coca-Cola (KO) and Microsoft (MSFT) have paused or are considering pulling their ads from the platform The New York Times reported.

X pegged the figure close to $11 million—but that was before Musk's now-infamous interview at the event this week.

The platform had already been struggling to generate ad revenues and Musk hired Linda Yaccarino former NBCUniversal Head of Advertising to help overcome that challenge.



Will Ad Dollars Head To Meta Snap?

The ad revenue fleeing the X app could find a home at other social media firms such as Meta Platforms (META) or Snap Inc. (SNAP) but advertiser concerns around brand safety are not limited to X.

Billionaire investment manager and X investor Bill Ackman lent his support to Musk. In an X post Ackman said that rival social media sites such as TikTok Facebook and Instagram have ""enormous amounts of problematic content antisemitic and otherwise"" but retain advertiser support.

He also proposed a novel idea for ownership of the site saying ""Perhaps someday the ownership of X should be distributed to each American one share for each"" to protect its goal of free speech.



Some Ad-Tech Companies May Benefit

With brand safety in the spotlight advertising technology companies that offer those services could stand to benefit. Companies such as Integrated Ad Science (IAS) and DoubleVerify (DV) could find themselves in demand.

Investors are taking those cues as well. IAS shares were up roughly 2.5% for the week and 63% since the start of the year. DoubleVerify shares gained about 4.4% in the week and rose nearly 53.4% year-to-date.

The stock market's ""Magnificent Seven"" consists of Apple Microsoft (MSFT 0.23%) Alphabet Amazon Nvidia Meta Platforms (META 0.62%) and Tesla. Grouped together under this banner due to their massive valuations and important positions in influential technologies these companies are shaping the world and have powerful competitive advantages.

Thanks to their massive reach and incredible strengths each of these companies has a good chance of delivering an impressive performance when the next roaring bull market hits. However investors should still be choosy about which of these megacap stocks they put their money behind.

With that in mind we asked two Motley Fool contributors which Magnificent Seven stock in particular they think would be a smart buy right now.

Microsoft could be the strongest player in AI

Keith Noonan: With a market capitalization of roughly $2.83 trillion Microsoft stands as the world's second-largest public company. And while Apple is currently valued at $2.95 trillion I think there's a good chance that Microsoft will soon take its crown -- and hold onto it for a long time.

Microsoft's strength in artificial intelligence (AI) across multiple product and service categories lies at the heart of my thesis for why the tech giant will enjoy a sustained run as the world's most valuable company. Its Azure service commands a top position in the cloud infrastructure space and Windows continues to be the world's most popular computer operating system.

Microsoft is also the clear leader when it comes to office productivity software and it has strong positioning in video games and other categories. Even better the tech titan has a strong partnership with and a substantial stake in OpenAI the company behind ChatGPT.

It has just started to roll out its Copilot AI assistant for enterprises and large organizations. Not only does Copilot stand a good chance of becoming a major new revenue source for Microsoft the personal assistant software will likely strengthen the company's overall services ecosystem. If customers want to take full advantage of Copilot the best way to do so will be to use a suite of Microsoft services that can offer superior compatibility features.

Beyond the company's many qualitative advantages Microsoft has also been posting excellent quantitative performances. In its fiscal 2024 first quarter which ended Sept. 30 sales climbed 13% year over year to $56.5 billion and earnings per share jumped 27%.

Microsoft is already seeing clear benefits from the rise of AI but the company is likely still in the early stages of benefiting from this massive shift. For long-term investors the software leader stands out as a top Magnificent Seven stock to buy right now.

Meta Platforms is an excellent stock for the long run

Parkev Tatevosian: Meta Platforms formerly known as Facebook is one of my favorite Magnificent Seven stocks with real long-term potential. It has a phenomenal business right now and is in an excellent position to protect that advantage for several years.

Meta caters to 3 billion monthly active users across its various social media platforms including Facebook Instagram Threads and WhatsApp. It has a great business model where Meta's users generate the content that Meta incorporates advertising into largely for free. Users post pictures comments and short-form videos that get friends family and/or fans to engage with the app. The virtuous cycle keeps people on the platform where Meta shows them advertisements.

That business model generated $117 billion in revenue in 2022. More importantly it generated $29 billion in operating income. Of course if this business model were easy to replicate everyone would do it. It's a challenging model and few businesses have found the right formula to make it a success.

Meta surpassed the most significant challenge by growing to reach 3 billion monthly active users. The fact that nearly everyone you know is likely on at least one of Meta's Platforms makes the apps more attractive to potential users and potential advertisers a concept known as the network effect. That is also Meta's competitive advantage.

At a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 19.5 Meta's stock price is not as expensive as tech growth stocks tend to be. For all these reasons Meta is one of my top Magnificent Seven stocks to buy now and hold for the long run.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vZnV0dXJpc20uY29tL3RoZS1ieXRlL2ZhY2Vib29rLXBlZG9waGlsaWEtcHJvYmxlbdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Facebook Has a Gigantic Pedophilia Problem,"It's still actively promoting pedophilic content.

Basic Issues

Facebook's parent company Meta is seriously struggling to keep pedophiles off its social media platforms.

Worse yet as The Wall Street Journal reports there have been instances of Instagram and Facebook actually promoting pedophile accounts making what sounds like an already dangerous situation even worse.

Earlier this year the newspaper teamed up with researchers at Stanford and the University of Massachusetts Amherst and found that Instagram's algorithms were connected to an entire distribution network of underage sex content.

At the time Meta formed a child-safety task force to address the glaring issue — but even after five long months the company still has a lot of work to do the WSJ found with the company's platforms still actively promoting pedophilic content.

Unmet Expectations

And it's not just Instagram. There are still entire Facebook groups dedicated to sharing content that sexualizes children.

Despite Meta's best efforts which included having its task force of more than 100 employees ban pedophile-related hashtags it's still a massive problem that will require drastic changes.

The scale of the issue is also incredibly damning. The Canadian Centre for Child Protection came across Instagram accounts that had up to 10 million followers that livestreamed videos of child sex abuse.

Other Facebook groups with hundreds of thousands of users still actively celebrate incest and sex with children per the WSJ's own investigation.

Perhaps most astonishingly even once the newspaper flagged these groups Meta claimed that they didn't violate any of the company's ""Community Standards"" despite the word ""Incest"" being in the name of one Facebook group.

So what's the solution? Meta said it's still refining the tools that limit the spread of pedophilic accounts and to its credit has finally started disabling accounts that are suspicious enough to exceed a certain threshold. The company claims it has removed 16000 accounts that violated child safety policies since July per the report.

But limiting the tools that algorithmically recommend content to users on Meta's platforms simply isn't in the cards as one spokesperson told the WSJ. After all it's likely a significant source of much of the company's revenue.

Making matters worse the company has also been laying off huge numbers of workers including those working on reviewing suspected inappropriate sexual content.

In short despite being caught red-handed Meta has seemingly done very little to address the issue — and that doesn't bode well considering the company's ever-shrinking headcount and already struggling content moderation teams.

The story so far: Usually competition regulators investigate trade practices sue corporations and levy penalties on them. For instance the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) probes antitrust practices and files lawsuits against tech companies it sees as violating consumer laws. But in a shock move Facebook-parent Meta in late November sued the FTC claiming the regulator was making an “obvious power grab” and that its action could cause the social media giant “immediate and irreparable” harm.

What is the case about?

Meta the parent of Facebook Instagram WhatsApp and Threads sued the U.S. FTC on November 29 in an effort to stop it from reopening a past privacy settlement where the social media company was ordered to pay $5 billion to settle charges that it violated an older FTC order.

The privacy settlement which was made in 2019 enforced broad privacy restrictions on Meta. The $5 billion penalty against Facebook was first announced in 2019 but is referred to as the 2020 privacy settlement. The FTC described it as “the largest ever imposed on any company for violating consumers’ privacy.”

What are the new changes the FTC wants Meta to make?

The FTC in May proposed changes to the three-year-old agreement noting that Meta had not fully complied with the previous terms. The FTC also alleged that Meta misled parents about the Messenger Kids app and misrepresented how some app developers could access private user data.

As part of the latest changes proposed by the FTC Meta would be barred from profiting off the data it collected from children (users below 18) as well as the data from its virtual reality products. Meta would also be restricted in its use of facial recognition technology its launch of new products and features and would have to provide even more user protections as per the regulator.

Meta spokesperson Andy Stone shared a statement on May 3 on X (formerly Twitter) in which he called the FTC’s action a “political stunt” and claimed the regulator did not allow Meta to discuss the agreement.

“Let’s be clear about what the FTC is trying to do: usurp the authority of Congress to set industry-wide standards and instead single out one American company while allowing Chinese companies like TikTok to operate without constraint on American soil” said part of Stone’s statement as he promised Meta would “vigorously fight” the action.

In its November complaint against the FTC Meta stressed that stopping the collection of children’s data would hurt its development.

“By way of example the Proposed Order purports to limit Meta’s collection and use of the data of so-called “Youth Users” which would severely curtail the Company’s ability to market new products and services to a key demographic of its users” noted Meta in its complaint.

Could the FTC’s proposed changes actually hurt Meta?

In its third quarter report this year Meta recorded revenue of $34.15 billion which was an increase of 23% year-over-year. However the company observed that rising legal and regulatory challenges across the European Union and the U.S. might affect its future financial results. In its report Meta called out the FTC in specific.

“Of note the Federal Trade Commission is seeking to substantially modify our existing consent order and impose additional restrictions on our ability to operate. We are contesting this matter but if we are unsuccessful it would have an adverse impact on our business” said the company on October 25.

The FTC is yet to publicly respond to Meta’s latest complaint or issue a formal statement.

Why did Meta claim the FTC does not have authority over the issue?

Meta claimed that the FTC’s proposed changes to the 2020 agreement violate due process and that the regulator itself plays an “unconstitutional dual role.” The social media company also believes that the FTC’s conditions would affect its ability to launch new products and services (without third-party approval) and would intrude on Meta’s private rights.

The company said it wanted to “challenge the structurally unconstitutional authority exercised by the FTC through its Commissioners.” However Meta highlighted that it was not looking to legally debate the FTC’s findings about its actions and instead wanted to focus on the constitutionality of the regulator’s structural characteristics. In particular Meta pointed at the FTC’s “dual role as prosecutor and judge” and said that the social media company had a right to a jury trial.

Has any other tech firm ever sued the FTC before?

While other companies have accused the FTC of overstepping its boundaries Meta’s act of suing the FTC is an aggressive move that came after a federal judge allowed the FTC’s proceeding to take place.

If Meta is successful even in part this could set a precedent for other companies singled out by the regulator to question the FTC’s ability to carry out unbiased proceedings and instead push for their case to be handled by jury trials. In turn such a shift could obstruct not only the FTC but also regulators such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and prevent them from carrying out swift enforcement actions against Big Tech companies in the future."

Knapp a longtime NFL assistant coach died on July 22 2021 when he was hit by a car while riding a bicycle near his home in California. He was 58.

Knapp had a longtime tradition of running the stairs in the stands a few hours before games and Jets and Falcons coaches and staffers participated in the “Knapp Stair Climb” before team warmups Sunday in support of The Coach Knapp Memorial Fund to raise funds for distracted driving awareness.

As part of this weekend's “My Cause My Cleats” initiative around the NFL several members of the Jets and Falcons are representing The Coach Knapp Memorial Fund including New York general manager Joe Douglas and special teams coordinator Brant Boyer and Atlanta assistant coaches Matt Schaub and T.J. Yates.

Several other NFL and NCAA teams have participated in the “Knapp Stair Climb” this season including Green Bay Cleveland New Orleans Dallas San Francisco Denver Houston and the Los Angeles Rams.

“The Falcons and Jets were our greatest champions last season and we are proud that they are returning for Year Two raising awareness for the dangers of distracted driving and to honor Greg’s legacy"" said Knapp's widow Charlotte who co-founded The Coach Knapp Memorial Fund. ""We are so grateful for the groundswell of support from across the NFL and at the college level.”

Following the tragedy the Jets started an annual tradition of running the stairs at MetLife Stadium to raise awareness of the dangers of distracted driving and raise money for The Coach Knapp Memorial Fund.

The tradition started because coach Knapp would run the same stairs before every home game. This week in the rain Jets staff members completed their run and were joined by staff members of the Atlanta Falcons as well.

""Greg had such an inner peace about him that people always seemed to gravitate towards"" Jets head coach Robert Saleh said of Knapp when he passed. ""He lived life in a loving way that helped him connect with people from all walks of life in a unique way. In his short time here I believe the people in this organization had a chance to experience that connection.""

During his two-and-a-half decades in the league Knapp served as an assistant coach for the San Francisco 49ers Falcons Oakland Raiders Seattle Seahawks Houston Texans and Denver Broncos whom he won a Super Bowl ring with in 2016.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipAFodHRwczovL2RvbHBoaW5uYXRpb24uY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMDIvdHlyZWVrLWhpbGwtZGlyZWN0bHktY2FsbHMtb3V0LW5mbC1mb2xsb3dpbmctamFlbGFuLXBoaWxsaXBzLWluanVyeS1hdC1tZXRsaWZlLXN0YWRpdW0teW91LWdvdHRhLXRha2UtY2FyZS1vZi15b3VyLXByb2R1Y3QtbmZsL9IBqAFodHRwczovL2RvbHBoaW5uYXRpb24uY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMDIvdHlyZWVrLWhpbGwtZGlyZWN0bHktY2FsbHMtb3V0LW5mbC1mb2xsb3dpbmctamFlbGFuLXBoaWxsaXBzLWluanVyeS1hdC1tZXRsaWZlLXN0YWRpdW0teW91LWdvdHRhLXRha2UtY2FyZS1vZi15b3VyLXByb2R1Y3QtbmZsL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tyreek Hill directly calls out NFL following Jaelan Phillips’ injury at MetLife Stadium: ‘You gotta tak...,"Miami Dolphins star wide receiver Tyreek Hill recently called out the NFL after linebacker Jaelan Phillips suffered an Achilles injury in the team’s win over the New York Jets back on Nov. 24.

“You never wanna see an injury like that happen man” Hill said on his podcast. “And we’ve been sayin’ it that the field conditions — havin’ a turf field outdoor sucks. It sucks man. I seen a poll on Twitter where they had a list of players that got hurt on that same exact field same injury. It’s like bruh you gotta take care of your product NFL. We gotta do better NFL. We gotta do better. … I really think the NFL they need — the NFL and the players and also the owners — we need to come to some kind of agreement where it’s like okay we gon’ have this kind of field. We gon’ have a turf field but it’s gon’ be indoors or we gon’ have — somethin’ it’s gotta be somethin’ goin’ on with it.”

Hill performed at a high level in the team’s 21-point victory over the Jets. He racked up 102 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown on nine receptions. But Jaylen Waddle ended up leading the team in receiving yards as he finished with 114.

In 11 games played with the Dolphins so far this season Hill has totaled 1324 receiving yards 10 receiving touchdowns and is averaging 120.4 receiving yards per game all of which lead the league. Additionally he has accumulated 62 first downs receiving.

Before joining the Dolphins ahead of the 2022 season Hill spent the first six seasons of his NFL career with the Kansas City Chiefs and even won a Super Bowl with the team. The Chiefs traded Hill to the Dolphins in exchange for five draft picks.

The Dolphins’ win over the Jets marked their eighth win of the season to this point. At 8-3 Miami owns the best record in the AFC East division by a wide margin. The Buffalo Bills own the second-best record in the division at 6-6. The Jets own the third-best record in the division at 4-7 while the New England Patriots own the worst record in the division at 2-9.

The Dolphins have six games remaining on their schedule in the regular season including a game against the Bills on Jan. 7 to wrap things up before the playoffs.

Hopefully in light of Phillips’ injury the NFL will consider improving the quality of the field at MetLife Stadium. After all as Hill alluded to Phillips isn’t the only player who has suffered an injury while playing at the stadium.

Next up on the schedule for the Dolphins is a date with the Washington Commanders. Miami will take on the Commanders — who own a 4-8 record on the season and have lost three games in a row — on Sunday with a chance to reach 9-3."

The MGM Grand Detroit workers are union members of the Detroit Casino Council which represents 3700 employees of Detroit's three casinos. The strike is suspended immediately according to the Detroit Casino Council.

According to the casino coucil the five-year agreement covering 1700 employees includes an average immediate 18% pay raise the largest wage increases ever for MGM Grand Detroit workers. The agreement also includes a bonus workload reductions no health care cost increases for employees and other job protections.

""Since welcoming my son into the world securing my family's health care benefits was the most important thing to me” Gabriel Robert Hernandez a valet at MGM Grand Detroit and member of Teamsters Local 1038 said in a statement Saturday. “We sacrificed a lot during the pandemic but we fought for and ultimately won a contract that secures our health care and provides significantly improved wages.”

The ratified agreement also includes contract language that addresses for the first time technology protections that includes guaranteeing that employees will get advance notification when new technology is introduced that impacts jobs.

In a statement Saturday Matt Buckley president and COO of Midwest Group MGM Resorts International said: “We’re glad our DCC-represented employees voted tonight to ratify the 64-month contract and end the strike allowing us to immediately resume full and normal operations at MGM Grand Detroit. We’re excited to welcome our team back and continue providing our guests the entertainment experiences for which MGM Grand Detroit is known.”

The agreement comes nearly two weeks after roughly 2100 workers at MotorCity Casino and Hollywood Casino at Greektown voted to ratify a new contract. Those workers were on strike for 34 days.

Members of the Detroit Casino Council walked off the job Oct. 17 after negotiations failed to reach new contracts. The workers including dealers cleaning staff food and beverage workers valets and engineers called for wage increases job and health care protections and reduced workloads.

The audacious but wobbly journey to host Formula 1 in Vegas after a four-decade absence had well-documented hurled but in the end delivered an enthralling GP probably the best race of the season. Won of course by Max Verstappen.

Now that the dust has settled on a memorable weekend (on all fronts good and bad) and the all-important dollar bills counted the Las Vegas Grand Prix gets a big thumbs up on the money ‘Richter-scale’ that always dictates more so in Sin City than anywhere else.

Regarding last month’s Las Vegas GP weekend MGM Resorts CFO Jonathan Halkyard told delegates at the Leveraged Finance Conference last week: “It was the highest-grossing weekend for us in hotel revenue in the company’s history. The second-highest was CES in 2019.

“So when you think about other events that have happened in Las Vegas over the years and the scale of our company that’s quite something to have a record weekend on what was otherwise the slowest weekend of the year.”

MGM Resorts: Las Vegas Grand Prix will be fantastic in the years to come

Halkyard explained: “We had very high expectations for what this event would be in Las Vegas. We invested heavily into it. In particular creating an experience for our casino customers and some retail customers in front of the Bellagio.”

Despite some negative reports including the outcry after the first-night ‘drain cover’ saga and closing the grandstands before the long-delayed FP2 session Halkyard acknowledged: “This was an event that certainly had a lot of friction in the months leading up to it a lot of construction in Las Vegas. Some of that will certainly be recurring but a lot of it will not be as dramatic in coming years.

“F1 and the city got the city ready for this event. F1 invested hundreds of millions of dollars in capital in their paddock facility. That along with the money that we invested to build this hospitality experience we’ll reuse that year after year. I’m optimistic this is going to be a fantastic event in the years to come.”

While exactly how much revenue MGM Resorts earned during Grand Prix week is unknown the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority Formula 1 and Las Vegas Grand Prix officials estimate the total economic impact to be around $1.2 billion each time the series comes to town."

Memory chip manufacturer Micron Technology (MU -0.28%) has been mired in one of the worst downturns in the industry's history. Demand for DRAM and NAND chips has fallen off a cliff and pricing has tumbled far quicker than Micron has been able to reduce costs. Industrywide production cuts and slimmed-down capital spending plans were enacted in an attempt to bring supply and demand back into sync.

Micron's last quarterly report was not encouraging. While revenue did edge up from the previous quarter it was down substantially year over year. Micron also reported a negative gross margin and an enormous net loss. With $4.01 billion in revenue the company booked a net loss of $1.43 billion.

Micron's guidance wasn't particularly optimistic either. While revenue was pegged at $4.4 billion for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 about 10% higher sequentially gross margin was still expected to be negative.

Micron burned through prodigious amounts of cash in fiscal 2023 as it weathered impossible market conditions. For the full year free cash flow was a loss of $5.45 billion. The good news is that the pricing environment appears to be improving beyond what Micron originally assumed. The company's comeback while likely still a slow affair may be set to accelerate.

Boosting guidance

Micron updated its guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 on Nov. 28 to reflect improving market conditions. The new outlook calls for revenue approaching $4.7 billion about $300 million above the midpoint of the company's previous outlook.

Gross margin is still expected to be negative but less so. On a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis gross margin is now expected to be between negative 2.5% and negative 2%. Operating expenses will be higher than expected driven by the timing of research and development expenses.

During a technology conference following the guidance update Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra also reiterated that the company expects 2025 to be a record year for the memory chip industry. That will require a recovery in demand and a recovery in prices.

One thing that will drive growth for Micron is specialized high-bandwidth memory or HBM chips used widely in AI accelerators. Not only is demand for HBM expected to expand but this rising demand will also reduce the supply of non-HBM memory available and potentially aid in pushing prices higher. AI servers also require more standard memory including DRAM and NAND chips. Micron estimates that a typical AI server uses 6 to 8 times as much DRAM and 2 to 3 times as much NAND as a standard server.

What could go wrong?

Memory chips are commodities and all commodity markets can go through boom-and-bust cycles.

Too much supply leads to tumbling prices. Tumbling prices lead manufacturers to slash production and cut down on growth investments. Lower production stabilizes prices and can potentially lead to a shortage. A shortage pushes up prices. High prices induce manufacturers to ramp up supply. Too much supply leads to tumbling prices and we're back to the beginning.

Sustained price increases will require Micron and the rest of the industry to keep a lid on production. It's unclear how much excess manufacturing capacity exists that could be turned back online quickly. It takes a long time and billions of dollars for new memory chip production to be built which is one reason industry cycles play out over a span of years. But it also only takes one spoiler focusing on market share rather than profits to ruin the party.

2024 is almost certain to be a better year for Micron than 2023 although how quickly revenue and profit recover depends on end-market demand and continued caution from all industry participants. Both are highly uncertain.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jaXRpZXMvYWhtZWRhYmFkL2d1amFyYXQtY20tdmlzaXRzLW1pY3Jvbi1wbGFudC1vbi1sYXN0LWRheS1vZi1zaW5nYXBvcmUtdHJpcC05MDUxOTAxL9IBfWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9jaXRpZXMvYWhtZWRhYmFkL2d1amFyYXQtY20tdmlzaXRzLW1pY3Jvbi1wbGFudC1vbi1sYXN0LWRheS1vZi1zaW5nYXBvcmUtdHJpcC05MDUxOTAxL2xpdGUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gujarat CM visits Micron plant on last day of Singapore trip,"As part of his seven-day trip to Japan and Singapore in the run-up to the Vibrant Gujarat Global Summit scheduled in January next year Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel visited the Micron Technology assembly and testing plant in Singapore on Saturday the last day of the visit.

MSFT,Microsoft,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAyL2ZvcmdldC1taWNyb3NvZnQtdW5zdG9wcGFibGUtc3RvY2tzLWFkb2JlLXBhbG8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Forget Microsoft: These Are the Unstoppable Stocks to Buy Now,"Two excellent alternatives to the software giant.

Investors have pushed Microsoft (MSFT 0.23%) stock to new highs in recent weeks. The tech giant's share price performance is trouncing the wider market having soared nearly 60% this year. By comparison the Nasdaq Composite gained 36%.

Some investors are concerned that this rally has made Microsoft a less compelling growth stock. It's approaching $3 trillion in market capitalization after all and Wall Street is well aware of its many sales catalysts ahead. These include artificial intelligence (AI) and the rising demand for video games and cybersecurity software in the years to come.

If you'd like exposure to some of these industries but are turned off by Microsoft's elevated valuation there are some good alternatives to consider. Read on for reasons to buy Adobe (ADBE -0.82%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW -0.60%) instead.

Adobe is cashing in on AI

Adobe stock is riding on a wave of enthusiasm about generative AI but it isn't just hype that's elevating investor sentiment in 2023. The software giant is already capitalizing on AI tech that's made its way into products like Photoshop and Premiere Pro. In mid-September Adobe revealed that higher demand across its portfolio has helped push profit to $4.9 billion in the first half of 2023 up from $4.5 billion a year earlier.

Adobe's focus on content creation positions it well to take full advantage of the rising value that AI is delivering. You can see evidence of that excitement in the fact that people have generated 2 billion images using its new Firefly software in just the first six months following its release. Subscription services are rising too contributing to impressive cash-flow trends.

The company is valued at a premium to Microsoft. But growth-stock investors see good reasons to like shares at the current valuation of 15x sales compared to Microsoft's price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 13. Its smaller sales footprint and greater focus on creative content could make Adobe a huge winner in the next era of computing tech.

Palo Alto Networks can keep its momentum

Microsoft offers cybersecurity protection as part of its huge services platform but investors might earn better returns from owning Palo Alto Networks over the next several years. Sure investors were a bit disappointed with the company's earnings update in late November which showed slowing billings trends.

Yet sales were up a healthy 20% in the Q3 period and are on track to rise at nearly the same pace for the full year. Most Wall Street pros are looking for Microsoft to grow at 4% this fiscal year by contrast.

An investment in Palo Alto Networks doesn't offer nearly the same level of diversity and safety that comes along with Microsoft's massive global sales base. You don't get a dividend from owning this cybersecurity business either.

Still investors who value growth will love Palo Alto Networks' expanding market share and its healthy market share in a competitive niche. Management is determined to keep boosting profitability as well building on the excellent momentum that shareholders saw here last year.

As is the case with Adobe you'll pay a higher premium to own Palo Alto right now as compared to late 2022. But for roughly the same price-to-sales valuation as Microsoft you'll get exposure to a leading software-as-a-service provider in an industry that's likely to see fantastic growth over the next several years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMDMvaG93LXJlYWRpbmctaGVscGVkLWJpbGwtZ2F0ZXMtY2hhbmdlLWNhcmVlcnMtYWZ0ZXItbWljcm9zb2Z0Lmh0bWzSAWVodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjLmNvbS9hbXAvMjAyMy8xMi8wMy9ob3ctcmVhZGluZy1oZWxwZWQtYmlsbC1nYXRlcy1jaGFuZ2UtY2FyZWVycy1hZnRlci1taWNyb3NvZnQuaHRtbA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This habit helped Bill Gates change careers after retiring from Microsoft—despite being 'very monomaniacal’ at the time,"Career changes can be hard even for Bill Gates — who credits a simple lifelong habit for his switch from a narrow-minded decades-long focus on computers and software to international philanthropy.

""I had a long period from about age 18 to 40 where I was very monomaniacal ... Microsoft was everything"" Gates 68 recently told comedian Trevor Noah on the ""What Now? With Trevor Noah"" podcast. ""I was lucky enough that as other people took over Microsoft I got to go and read and learn about all the health challenges why children die.""

The billionaire Microsoft co-founder has long been known as a voracious reader. The habit planted the seeds of his career transition three years before it actually occurred: In 1997 Gates and his then-wife Melinda French Gates read an article about children across the globe dying of diseases that were easily cured in the United States.

The story stuck with him when he stepped down as Microsoft's CEO in 2000. With even more time to read he researched ongoing global health crises and decided to make the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation his primary focus he said.

His ability to research thoroughly and synthesize information effectively — honed by a lifetime of reading — helped get him up to speed on health inequities identify areas where his money could help and illuminate potential solutions he's said.

""Reading fuels a sense of curiosity about the world which I think helped drive me forward in my career and in the work that I do now with my foundation"" Gates told Time in 2017.

Since 2000 the foundation has spent $53.8 billion to fight global health crises like AIDS malaria and tuberculous according to its website. It's played a significant role by Gates' estimation in halving the number of children under age 5 who die each year — though it's been criticized by political scientists and development scholars for a lack of transparency and oversight and difficulty measuring its impact.

Gates is far from the only public figure with his nose in a book: Plenty of prominent people in tech politics and business self-identify as avid readers. Those who want to be successful need to be reading every day billionaire investor Mark Cuban told comedian Bill Maher's ""Club Random"" podcast last year.

""Somebody 40 and over even 30 and over if you're not reading you're f---ed ... because you're not expanding your mind"" Cuban said adding that he tells his kids: ""Somebody who doesn't read lives one life somebody who reads an unlimited number of lives.""

Reading strengthens empathy communication and leadership skills according to experts. As a daily habit it can even help you live longer according to a 2016 study.

The mail systems run a software version that is currently unsupported and no longer receives any type of updates being vulnerable to multiple security issues some with a critical severity rating.

Exchange Server 2007 still running

Internet scans from The ShadowServer Foundation show that there are close to 20000 Microsoft Exchange servers currently reachable over the public internet that have reached the end-of-life (EoL) stage.

On Friday more than half of the systems were located in Europe. In North America there were 6038 Exchange servers and in Asia 2241 instances.

Microsoft Exchange servers that reached end of support

source: The ShadowServer Foundation

However ShadowServer’s statistics may not show the complete picture as Macnica security researcher Yutaka Sejiyama discovered a little over 30000 Microsoft Exchange servers that reached end of support.

According to Sejiyama’s scans on Shodan in late November there were 30635 machines on the public web with an unsupported version of Microsoft Exchange:

275 instances of Exchange Server 2007

instances of Exchange Server 2007 4062 instances of Exchange Server 2010

instances of Exchange Server 2010 26298 instances of Exchange Server 2013

Remote code execution risk

The researcher also compared the update rate and observed that since April this year the global number of EoL Exchange servers dropped by just 18% from 43656 a decrease that Sejiyama feels is insufficient.

“Even recently I still see news of these vulnerabilities being exploited and now I understand why. Many servers are still in a vulnerable state” - Yutaka Sejiyama

The ShadowServer Foundation highlights that the outdated Exchange machines discovered on the public web were vulnerable to multiple remote code execution flaws.

Some of the machines running older versions of the Exchange mail server are vulnerable to ProxyLogon a critical security issue tracked as CVE-2021-26855 that can be chained with a less severe bug identified as CVE-2021-27065 to achieve remote code execution.

According to Sejiyama based on the build numbers obtained from the systems during the scan there are close to 1800 Exchange systems that are vulnerable to either ProxyLogon ProxyShell or ProxyToken vulnerabilities.

ShadowServer notes that the machines in their scans are vulnerable to the following security flaws:

CVE-2020-0688

CVE-2021-26855 - ProxyLogon

CVE-2021-27065 - part of the ProxyLogon exploit chain

CVE-2022-41082 - part of the ProxyNotShell exploit chain

CVE-2023-21529

CVE-2023-36745

CVE-2023-36439

Although most of the vulnerabilities above do not have a critical severity score Microsoft marked them as “important.” Furthermore except for the ProxyLogon chain - which has been exploited in attacks all of them were tagged as “more likely” to be exploited.

Even if companies still running outdated Exchange servers have implemented available mitigations the measure is not sufficient as Microsoft recommends prioritizing the installation of updates on the servers that are externally facing.

In the case of instances that reached the end of support the only option remaining is to upgrade to a version that still receives at least security updates.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxhZGVscGhpYWVhZ2xlcy5jb20vdmlkZW8vZGVzZWFuLWphY2tzb24tbWljcm9zb2Z0LXRlYW1zLWxlZ2VuZC1vZi10aGUtd2Vla9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Microsoft Teams Legend of the Week: DeSean Jackson,,,,

William Paul Gray was charged through criminal information in March and pleaded guilty to Conspiracy to Commit Health Care Fraud.

Gray was also ordered to pay over seven million dollars in restitution by U.S. District Judge Brantley Starr.

Documented in plea papers Gray admitted that he and his coconspirators accessed private patient information including names dates of birth and insurance subscriber names through confidential electronic medical records to obtain large amounts of patient information.

ALSO SEE:

Gray and his coconspirators then used this information to submit claims to various insurance providers including Blue Cross Blue Shield Cigna United Healthcare Aetna Humana and Molina Health Care for COVID-19 testing that was never performed.

The patients had not requested said testing and were also unaware that their information was being used.

It is also reported that Gray admitted that the ""labs"" where Gray's coconspirators claimed the testing occurred were shell entities that never operated as labs.

ALSO SEE:

These entities submitted $30 million in claims and were paid more than seven million dollars in reimbursement for fake testing.

Also charged are 52-year-old Connie Jo Clampitt 40-year-old Terrance Barnard and 37-year-old Don Hogg.

Clampitt Barnard and Hogg have each pled guilty and are awaiting sentencing.

Patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) treated with NKGen’s autologous natural killer (NK) cell therapy SNK01 in the phase 1 ASK-AD clinical trial (NCT04678453) showed clinical improvement according to a recent company announcement summarizing data presented at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease Annual Meeting held October 24-27 2023 in Boston Massachusetts.1

Among 10 patients evaluated compared with their baseline at 1 week after receiving their final dose in the trial 30% demonstrated clinical improvement on the Alzheimer’s disease composite score (ADCOMS) 60% of patients demonstrated a stable ADCOMS score and 1 patient who previously had an ADCOMS score classified as moderate achieved an ADCOMS score classified as mild. Furthermore 50% to 70% of the 10 patients showed scores that were stable or improved compared with baseline on the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).

At 12 weeks after receiving their final dose 44% to 89% of 9 patients evaluable for efficacy at this point either showed improvement or maintained stability on all cognitive scores compared with their results at 1 week after the final dose. Additionally 50% of the patients who had a stable ADCOMS score at 1 week after the final dose remained stable at 12 weeks after the final dose. In terms of safety no treatment-related adverse events were reported. The company also noted that SNK01 showed activation and expansion in all patients.

The single-center dose-escalation study divided patients into 3 cohorts and they received doses of SNK01 at either 1x109 cells 2x109 cells or 4x109 cells. Patients received the therapy intravenously in 4 administrations every 3 weeks. At baseline 5 patients had AD classified as mild 3 patients had AD classified as moderate and 2 patients had AD classified as severe. Their CDR-SB scores at baseline ranged from 4 to 18 (median 9).

Key Takeaways Patients with Alzheimer disease were treated with NKGen's NK cell therapy SNK01 in a phase 1 clinical trial and at 1 week after the final dose 30% demonstrated improvement on the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score score and 60% showed a stable score.

At 12 weeks after the final dose 44% to 89% of patients maintained stability or improvement on cognitive scores.

No treatment-related adverse events were reported indicating safety.

“We are pleased to present the final data from our phase 1 AD study further demonstrating that SNK01 is well tolerated and appears to reduce both proteins (pTau181 and Aβ42/40) and neuroinflammation (GFAP [glial fibrillary acidic protein]) among trial patients” Paul Y. Song MD CEO of NKGen Biotech said in a statement.1 “Remarkably despite a median baseline MMSE score of 14 and the fact that two-thirds of our patients received what we believe to be suboptimal dosing using the ADCOMS score 90% of patients demonstrated improvement or maintained stable cognitive function following 11 weeks suggesting that SNK01 may do more than simply slow disease progression.”

SNK01 is also being evaluated in clinical trials as a monotherapy and as part of combination therapies with other treatments such as checkpoint inhibitors and cell engagers for the treatment of patients with advanced refractory solid tumors.2 In February of this year SNK01 was approved by the FDA for compassionate use in a patient with Parkinson disease.3

“When we first proposed the use of our enhanced NK cells for neurodegenerative diseases we were met with skepticism” Song continued.1 “But thanks to the clinical team at Hospital Angeles who worked with us to get full Comisión Federal para la Protección contra Riesgos Sanitarios and Research Ethics Board approval we were able to conduct this groundbreaking trial which has provided us with invaluable clinical and biomarker data that undoubtedly helped us receive US investigational new drug (IND) clearance for a phase 1/2a study in patients with moderate-stage AD. Whereas this phase 1 trial was a dose-escalation trial that only gave 4 total doses over 11 weeks our new IND approval calls for using a higher dose and a prolonged dosing regimen. We are very excited to begin this next phase in hopes of establishing an entirely new treatment paradigm for more advanced patients.”

Nadezhda Omelchenko MD a research associate at Cancer Center of Southern California in Santa Monica spoke about case studies for SNK01 in sarcomas that she presented at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy 2023 Annual Meeting held May 16-20 in Los Angeles California.4 Omelchenko went over the key results from each of the 3 patients who had different forms of chemotherapy-resistant soft tissue sarcoma. The cases were unique in terms of dosing and other factors but some positive results were observed in each.

“The rationale of the study was to use people’s own innate immune system in a manner of anticancer activity” Omelchenko said. “In this case NK cells were used as the essential innate immune system cells. They were first taken from the peripheral blood then enhanced and amplified in the laboratory ex vivo and then administered back to the patients in an increased therapeutic dose. We used it in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors which not only inhibit immunosuppressive activity of T cells but also uncloak in the tumor microenvironment which allows it to evade the immune system. It is believed the combination of these 2 immunotherapy drugs could lead to better and more effective increased activity in a person's own innate immune system which has a crucial role in anticancer activity.”

Only 17 out of 82 brands investigated by the consumer organisation were judged to be using chocolate from suppliers that ensured farmers were paid enough to live on.

As a result there is a risk that Advent calendars chocolate Santas and other Christmas treats will have been produced with child labour. About 60% of the world’s cocoa comes from west Africa and about six in 10 cocoa-growing households in Ghana are estimated to use child labour with four in 10 in Ivory Coast.

Ethical Consumer recommended Tony’s Chocolonely Divine and Chocolat Madagascar among the brands which paid Fairtrade International or Rainforest Alliance rates or higher and use chocolate made in the country of origin rather than from imported beans. That helps the economies of cocoa-producing countries rather than European manufacturers.

It rated Mars Nestlé and Mondelēz which owns Cadbury as poor and “brands to avoid” while Ferrero was rated poor.

Each has a sustainability scheme but the researchers said that these schemes “tend to cover just a proportion of the company’s cocoa suppliers” which means that some farmers do not benefit.

Last year Channel 4’s Dispatches found that 10-year-old children were using machetes to harvest cocoa destined for Mondelēz’s supply chain.

The 82 brands were also measured on tax conduct use of palm oil deforestation and plastic and packaging.

Jasmine Owens at Ethical Consumer said: “The chocolate industry is incredibly unequal with many cocoa farmers living in poverty while international chocolate companies are raking in billions of pounds.

“Most of the world’s chocolate is grown in west Africa and the conditions for farmers are in general really appalling. But it’s European and UK consumers who eat most of it. So we really do have a huge amount of power and responsibility over conditions for farmers in west Africa because we’re the reason why they’re harvesting the cocoa.”

Owens said that buying chocolate from brands such as Fairafric ’57 Chocolate and Chocolat Madagascar was expensive and could be hard to get hold of but they were good “as a treat or a present” while Tony’s Chocolonely was widely available in supermarkets and “really trying to change the chocolate industry”.

Joke Aerts of Tony’s Open Chain the company’s supply chain platform said it was trying “to put human rights at the core of purchasing practices” by using traceable cocoa beans paying the living income reference price (the amount a typical farmer needs to make to be able to live) helping farming co-ops to become more professional working with them for at least five-year periods and helping farmers improve crop yields so they had less incentive to clear land to plant more cacao trees.

A report by the National Opinion Research Centre at the University of Chicago in 2020 found that 43% of children living in cocoa-growing areas in Ghana and Ivory Coast were engaged in hazardous child labour amounting to about 1.56 million children.

Often these children are taken out of school to work on the farm by their parents according to Katie Bird of the International Cocoa Initiative a nonprofit working to end child labour and forced labour in cocoa. “Farmer poverty is a significant contributing factor” she said. “There is a role for the cocoa industry quite clearly but also for governments in cocoa-producing countries civil society organisations producers themselves and a role for cocoa-consuming countries as well.” That means also ensuring access to good quality schooling healthcare and helping farmers diversify.

Ghana and Ivory Coast have laws against child labour and police patrol some plantations. Yet the size of the cocoa-growing areas makes them hard to police according to Mike Rogerson a lecturer in operations management at Sussex University and an expert on modern slavery in supply chains.

“Cocoa prices are set globally annually and they always disappoint everyone that follows these negotiations except the four largest companies using cocoa” said Rogerson. “Companies not paying a proper price effectively means that parents can’t afford to make a living and look after the family on their own.”

He said it was hard for companies to track where their cocoa had come from because farmers sometimes sell beans to each other since cocoa is typically traded in 50kg bags and beans are often mixed in different processing centres. It would cost the industry about £4m a year to trace cocoa beans using their DNA he said but so far there has been little interest in the technology from any chocolate company.

Mondelēz did not respond directly but referred to its sustainability report which said it aims to source all of its chocolate through its Cocoa Life programme by 2025 and increase the number of farmers in the programme to 300000 by 2030.

A Nestlé spokesperson said: “We believe that Ethical Consumer’s assessment of our approach does not reflect the comprehensive detail we provided about our work and therefore does not represent the extent of our efforts to sustainability source cocoa for our products.

“At Nestlé we have pioneered industry-leading projects and initiatives to further improve the sustainable sourcing of cocoa for our products and to help improve farmers’ livelihoods.”

Nestlé runs an “income accelerator programme” with 10000 farm families in Ivory Coast allowing them to earn up to €500 extra a year for two years and aims to reach 160000 families by 2030.

A Ferrero spokesperson said: “Our cocoa is 100% sourced through independently managed standards such as Rainforest Alliance Fairtrade Foundation and Cocoa Horizons.”

Ferrero said it worked with farmer groups on improving livelihoods by increasing cocoa productivity and diversifying and supporting the wellbeing of women and children and the environment.

“We committed to paying the Living Income Differential which we support and we also pay all farmers a cash premium on top of the commercial price” the company said.

“Ferrero remains committed to its cocoa sustainability programme to achieve a positive and lasting impact on the cocoa value chain.”

A spokesperson for Mars said: “Our ambition is that 100% of our cocoa is responsibly sourced globally and is traceable by 2025 – going beyond the current level of certification standards and practices and committing us to action across three focus areas that puts farmers communities and the environment at the centre of our efforts.

“We’re taking concrete action to make a difference in cocoa growing communities which is why we launched our Cocoa for Generations strategy in 2018 – a farmer-first initiative backed by a billion-dollar investment over 10-years that addresses farmer income and welfare in a multifaceted way because it is proven that pricing alone isn’t the answer.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vc21hbGwtYml6L3RyYWRlL2V4cG9ydHMvaW5zaWdodHMvY2hvY29sYXRlLXByaWNlcy1hcmUtcmlzaW5nLWV2ZXJ5d2hlcmUtYXMtY29jb2Etcm90cy1pbi13ZXN0LWFmcmljYS9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy8xMDU2NzA5MjYuY21z0gGeAWh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9zbWFsbC1iaXovdHJhZGUvZXhwb3J0cy9pbnNpZ2h0cy9jaG9jb2xhdGUtcHJpY2VzLWFyZS1yaXNpbmctZXZlcnl3aGVyZS1hcy1jb2NvYS1yb3RzLWluLXdlc3QtYWZyaWNhL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy8xMDU2NzA5MjYuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chocolate prices are rising everywhere as cocoa rots in West Africa,"Bloomberg

iStock The US Department of Agriculture forecasts prices for sugar and sweets rising 8.9% this year and another 5.6% next year outpacing total food inflation.

The muck from incessant rain sloshes around Nestor N’Guessan’s feet as he points to a plot of cocoa trees ravaged by rot on his farm in Ivory Coast The 52-year-old grower can’t save those plants from black pod disease so he’s focusing efforts on quarantining whatever healthy ones he has left. The soakings of recent months mean fewer pods on his trees with some supporting just a handful of cocoa buds.“I had to create a boundary to prevent the rest of the plantation from being contaminated” he said while pruning the healthy thicket. “Yields are low. The weather hasn’t helped us.”It’s a climate crisis playing out across Ivory Coast and Ghana the heavyweights of cocoa with consequences for global food inflation and the cost-of-living squeeze. Too much rain is lowering output and delaying harvests with the resulting shortfall catapulting wholesale prices in New York to their highest in 46 years.The total precipitation in West Africa since the rainy season started May 1 has been more than double the 30-year average according to Maxar Technologies Inc. The damage to yields is compounded by growers’ long struggle over pay leaving them little money to pour back into their plots.This is the main harvest period and the constant deluge turns dirt roads into impassable swamps knocks flowers off before they bud and fosters breeding of a fungal infection that turns rugby ball-sized pods into black mush.Ghana’s output is expected to be the lowest in 13 years and Ivory Coast’s the smallest in seven based on totals provided by traders and exporters. Together the countries produce about 60% of the world’s beans according to the International Cocoa Organization.The most-active futures are trading at the highest since 1977 in New York soaring past $4200 a ton. At that price you could buy about 50 barrels of oil.“This is a bull market and it hasn’t peaked yet” said Fuad Mohammed Abubakar head of government-affiliated Ghana Cocoa Marketing Co. (UK) Ltd. which sells and exports premium cocoa. “More risks lie ahead.”With sugar also reaching a decade high consumers likely will spend more for their chocolate bars cookies and hot cocoa as Christmas approaches. The US Department of Agriculture forecasts prices for sugar and sweets rising 8.9% this year and another 5.6% next year outpacing total food inflation.Citing higher supply costs Mondelez International Inc. maker of Toblerone bars and Oreo cookies will raise some prices next year Chief Executive Officer Dirk Van de Put told Bloomberg Television on Nov. 6. Nestle SA owner of Haagen-Dazs ice cream and Quality Street candies said it will do the same.It would be logical to conclude that farmers benefit from the bounty but in reality they’re not — even with the $400-a-ton premium tacked onto the market price as the living income differential.The cocoa markets in Ivory Coast and Ghana are strictly controlled by the governments and regulators typically sell beans to foreign buyers at least 12 months in advance.That means the money being paid to farmers for this season’s crop was locked in about a year ago when futures were about $2500 a ton.“At current farmgate prices farmers aren’t incentivized to go into the farms” said Mahmoud Khayat senior trader at Ivory Cocoa Products a bean processing company. “If prices were high he would swim to get the cocoa.”Right now growers are waiting on the government’s negotiations for next season with top buyers such as Barry Callebaut AG Cargill Inc. and Olam International Ltd. The sides are in a standoff with the companies holding off purchases because they want a discount according to people familiar with the matter.Typically there would be a push to plant more seedlings to capitalize on the boom but many growers are prisoners to the rain and can’t afford to hire more hands use more fertilizer or buy the necessary chemicals to ward off black pod.The soil on Samuel Addo’s 12-acre plot in Suhum district Ghana — about 65 kilometers (40 miles) north of the capital Accra — has a sandy consistency making it a bit more difficult to grow cocoa even in the best conditions.After a heavy downpour nearly every tree sprouted a pod that was either rotting or turning black. The only way to tame the spread is for Addo to spray his buds called cherelles every two weeks but that expense is out of reach.“It’s never attacked my farm this bad since I started farming cocoa” Addo 52 said. “What I’m earning is not enough to invest back into the farm.”The El Nino weather pattern could trigger more hardship ahead as dry conditions typically set in across West Africa. Global output hasn’t met demand for the past two seasons and it’s expected to stay that way for several more years Abubakar said.“The supply response will not be instant” he said. “It will take time for higher prices to boost production.”Plus deforestation regulations coming from the European Union — a major hub for West Africa's crop — are likely to escalate costs as beans are tracked through the supply chain.At this time of the year processing plants in San Pedro Ivory Coast’s main export hub should be running at full tilt to clean fumigate and pack the beans into 65-kilogram (143-pound) jute bags ready for shipment.Yet total port arrivals in the season that started Oct. 1 total 479449 tons compared with an estimated 707200 tons a year ago. That’s a 32% drop.The dearth of supply forced Societe Ivoirienne de Transformation de Produits Agricoles which can process more than 1500 tons a day to idle one of its machines the day a Bloomberg reporter visited.The exporter is receiving about 20 cargo trucks daily compared with about 24-26 trucks a year ago. The artery to the cocoa basket — a rugged road to begin with — is now pocked by holes brimming with rainwater making the journey even more treacherous.The National Federation of Dockers which represents workers in Ivory Coast’s main ports said this season has been abnormal. During a recent week it counted 29 trucks in San Pedro and 32 in Abidjan compared with 70 and 61 respectively a year earlier.“The flow of cocoa harvest arrivals is very low” the federation said in an email. “Members who are usually very busy unloading cocoa bags from trucks have been redeployed to other jobs.”The challenging climate and low pay are prompting some farmers to give up their beans in favor of other commodities notably rubber and gold.N’Guessan’s farm in Soubre Ivory Coast’s cocoa heartland is about a seven-hour drive from Abidjan. In recent years vast rubber plantations sprung up around him to satisfy demand for tires hoses and other products.Rubber trees need less maintenance and Ivory Coast is now the top producer in Africa.“Many planters have abandoned cocoa” he said.In Ghana the lure is gold. Artisanal mining accounts for about a third of the country’s output and farmers talk about companies persistently offering them large sums of money to give up their land.A ride through the nation’s cocoa belt finds many plantations replaced by what are known locally as galamsey.“There is a myth that cocoa farms are often sitting on gold-rich stones” grower Michael Acheampong said looking at the mine next door. “Some farmers cannot resist the allure of quick money.”The Cote d’Ivoire-Ghana Cocoa Initiative was created by both nations to dim that luster. The cartel’s purpose is to raise prices paid to farmers saying they haven’t covered the costs of production or guaranteed a living wage for decades Executive Secretary Alex Assanvo said.“If farmers see high prices today and a lower price is given to them how do we see farmers continue growing cocoa?” he said.",,,,,,

Max Verstappen initially trolled Lando Norris with a Red Bull Sticker in Abu Dhabi

As soon as the sponsorship was revealed the Milton Keynes-based team trolled 'Team Papaya' in epic fashion with a video of Lando Norris drinking from a can of Red Bull.

Red Bull Racing's Instagram account posted the video of Lando while captioning it ""DW (Don't worry) Lando Norris we will always support you in your time of need""

Formula 1 season 20223 Champion Max Verstappen was also a little naughty when they met in Abu Dhabi during November 26th's. While Verstappen and Norris were exchanging some words next to the track he quietly slapped a Red Bull sticker on Lando Norris's back without him noticing and had fun in front of the cameras.

Red Bull Racing lands the first strong punch against Monster Energy who decided to leave Mercedes after 14 seasons and join McLaren starting the 2024 Formula 1 season.

Monster Energy changed sponsorship teams from Mercedes Benz to McLaren

An Auckland bakery has been devastated overnight after four youths ram-raided their store causing over $20000 in damage for a $4 energy drink.

CCTV footage from the incident shows the four young offenders reversing a car into the Pakuranga Bakery on Ti Rakau Drive at 11.41pm last night until the glass door smashes.

Only two of the youths squeeze under the wrecked doors on their stomachs one armed with a metal rod the other with a golf club.

The owner of the store Pho Ky Huong Bok said this is not the first time this has happened.

Last December they were targeted and again only a can of drink was stolen. The damages cost them $20000 but the clean-up is not the final price tag after attacks like these.

“We got to deal with the hassle of cleaning up or getting everything” Bok said

“Then the main part is just like when you have that wooden door thing it looks like you’re closed for renovation

“We will be waiting for the glass and the frames to come for like a month and a half.

“That will be our quietest period.”

Bok said although the glass is covered by insurance he will lose at least $2000 today due to wasted stock. He was meant to fly out for a month-long holiday through Asia tonight which now seems unlikely due to the major clean-up job ahead of him.

Detective Inspector Shaun Vickers Counties Manukau CIB said the four youths involved were arrested last night after also targeting a vape store just a short drive away.

The getaway car was seen travelling through Glen Innes “in a dangerous manner” just after midnight. Police were able to spike the car as it crossed the Orams Rd overbridge.

“The vehicle has eventually crashed into a fence on Weymouth Rd where four youths were subsequently taken into custody a short distance away” Vickers said.

“This was a reckless incident which could have resulted in serious harm or loss of life to those involved.

“Our message to those who choose to continue to engage in this offending is: You will be held to account.”

The four youths have been referred to Youth Aid.

The agreement was signed on the sidelines of ITOCHU’s anniversary celebrations for its long-term business relationship with the Sultanate. Since the first contract year of 1974 ITOCHU has consistently been the Ministry of Energy and Minerals’ one of the longest private off-takers responsible for lifting Oman crude.

The 50th sales and purchase agreement for the year 2024 was signed by H.E. Salim Al Aufi Ministry of Energy and Minerals and Mr Masaya Tanaka President of Energy and Chemicals Company Executive Officer ITOCHU Corporation at a gala event held at InterContinental Hotel in the presence of several dignitaries including H.E. Nasser Al Jashmi Secretary General Ministry of Finance H.E. Mohsin Al Hadhrami Undersecretary of Ministry of Energy and Minerals and H.E. Jota Yamamoto Ambassador of Japan to the Sultanate of Oman.

The evening commenced with an introduction by Mr. Daigo Takeishi General Manager ITOCHU Muscat Office and opening remarks by Mr. Masaya Tanaka ITOCHU Corporation. This was followed by H.E. Salim Al Aufi Ministry of Energy and Minerals addressing the gathering.

The programme also featured a presentation on ITOCHU Oman Leadership Program by Zakiya Al Azri of PDO Ahmed Al Sukaili of OIA and the ITOCHU Oil Exploration Seminar by Ali Al Hajri OQ Upstream. Mr. Kenji Otsuka CEO of the Middle East bloc ITOCHU Corporation delivered the closing remarks.

Mr. Tetsuya Yamada Chief Operating Officer of ITOCHU Corporation's Energy Division emphasised the significant growth of ITOCHU's operations in Oman spanning five decades. The company plans to extend its reach into low-carbon energy sectors specifically Hydrogen/Ammonia as well as renewable energy business including energy derived from waste. These are aimed at making substantial contributions to the In-Country Value (ICV) initiative in the forthcoming years.

In addition to its involvement in Oman's energy sector ITOCHU is also a shareholder of both Oman LNG and Qalhat LNG and has been lifting liquefied natural gas (LNG) since 2006 in addition to its crude oil contract. The company is also the largest shareholder of Barka Desalination Company which started its commercial operations in June 2018 as the largest desalination plant in Oman. ITOCHU also imports Mazda cars and purified terephthalic acid (PTA) to Oman and exports French beans from Oman to Japan.

With approximately 90 offices in 61 countries ITOCHU is engaging in domestic trading import/export and overseas trading of various products such as textiles machinery metals minerals energy chemicals food general products realty information and communications technology and finance as well as business investment in Japan and overseas.

ITOCHU Corporation has a chequered history that goes back to 1858 when the Company's founder Chubei Itoh commenced linen trading operations. Since then ITOCHU has evolved and grown over 160 years. In FYE 2023 despite a complex business environment rattled by severe exchange rate volatility and high raw material prices attributable to inflation the company seized on the tailwinds of high resource prices and rapidly rising market conditions. As a result consolidated net profit totalled ¥800.5bn (Approx. US$ 6 billion) holding steady at the high level of over ¥800bn for the second consecutive year after FYE 2022’s record high of ¥820.3 billion. On March 1 2023 Moody’s raised the company’s long-term rating to A2 securing ITOCHU the highest rating of any general trading company from the major rating organizations. In FYE 2024 the final year of the medium-term management plan “Brand-new Deal 2023” the company plans to achieve a conservative ¥780.0bn in consolidated net profit in the light of volatile market conditions and a persistently murky global economic outlook including ongoing geopolitical risks.",,,,,,,,,,,,

In the July-to-September period the company's online music subscribers topped 100 million on a quarterly basis for the first time since TME listed in the U.S. in late 2018. That's still just a fraction of the 594 million monthly active users that TME claims. Because of the size of China's market it's more than Spotify 's claim of 574 million monthly active users —across 184 countries and territories. TME's ""music value [is] still underappreciated"" Morgan Stanley analysts led by Alex Poon wrote in a late November report. The analysts' conversations with TME management revealed expectations that music subscribers will grow by more than 3 million a quarter to an estimated 150 million in the medium term. ""We see room for [TME] music revenue to double and profit to triple in the next three years"" the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote noting ""limited risks from macro and competition."" They raised their price target on TME 10% to $11 implying more than 30% upside from Friday's close in Tencent Music Entertainment's American Depositary Receipts. TME's ADRs are up only 2% for the year so far while rival Spotify shares have surged almost 130%. Now Spotify has a market capitalization about 150% more than Tencent Music Entertainment's. TME SPOT YTD mountain Tencent Music Entertainment vs Spotify in 2023. Spotify isn't available in China a market notorious for content piracy. But in the past few years companies have become more vigilant in protecting intellectual property while consumers are getting in the habit of paying. ""The music industry has been the fastest growing entertainment segment in China with 140% revenue growth between 2019 and 2023"" according to Morgan Stanley estimates. That's far faster than any other entertainment segment the analysts tracked — including video games which saw revenue grow of 30% since 2019. A live concert craze swept China this year making tickets tough to get. In the first quarter alone TME said it hosted 29 online and offline concerts. For listeners at home or on the go TME's apps include QQ Music and Kugou Music. JPMorgan is so excited about Tencent Music Entertainment it recently upgraded its recommendation to overweight from neutral with a new price target of $10 a share. TME is ""re-emerging as a double-digit earnings compounder"" JPMorgan internet analyst Alex Yao wrote in a mid-November report. Gross profit margin of the online music segment rose to the mid-30% range in the third quarter versus Spotify's 25% over the past 12 months according to JPMorgan estimates. TME is also moving away from its business in social entertainment such as livestreaming and karaoke. ""Online music has overtaken social entertainment as the profit driver in 3Q23 leading to a stronger-than-expected profit growth recovery in 2024"" JPMorgan's Yao wrote. In the third quarter TME's revenue from social entertainment and other services fell by 49% to the equivalent of $276 million from the same period a year ago. Revenue from music subscriptions is estimated to rise 38% in 2023 versus 2022 Morgan Stanley estimates. TME earlier this year also launched a program to help new artists grow their audiences and boost revenue. Tencent Music Entertainment said in a first quarter release it had helped 260 musicians reach their first million streams. It did not provide an update in the third quarter. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.

""We were really challenged this year especially in the back half of the year still dealing with the challenges of the pandemic and unwinding a lot of excess inventory. That was exacerbated as interest rates went up"" Aaron Dunn portfolio manager at Morgan Stanley's U.S. Value Fund told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Friday. The phenomenon impacted numerous companies – particularly small and mid-cap names noted Dunn who also holds the title of co-head of value equity at Morgan Stanley. ""I think that sets up nicely for next year because I believe we've sort of cleaned out a lot of the excess from the past couple of years and it really [allows] a lot of companies to see real demand flow through their business and see better margins"" he added. When pressed on what stocks make good plays Dunn responded with four names adding: ""There's a lot of opportunities out there to pick up really good companies on the cheap."" FMC Corporation Agricultural sciences company FMC Corporation – which makes products like harvest aids and herbicides – is among the names on Dunn's list. It made up 2.4% of his U.S. Value Fund as of Oct. 31. ""If you look at FMC to me it's a specialty chemical company that is probably trading closer to a commodity chemical company. So it's a business that earns really good returns – they've got a very good moat around their business in terms of competitive set"" he said. Year-to-date shares in the agricultural company are down around 57%. The stock — like others in the agriculture sector — came under pressure this year following significant declines in its inventory Dunn noted. Going forward he says that most of the risk has already been priced in and ""better earnings are likely to come over the next two years."" ""Plus [it is] a cheap stock that provides a nice tailwind to performance"" he added. Alcoa Corp Aluminum producer Alcoa is another name that Dunn likes as the production of lightweight cars pushes up the demand for the metal. The stock accounted for just over 2% of the U.S. Value Fund holdings at the end of October. ""Alcoa is a great company that has really set themselves up from a balance sheet perspective to lower the risk of the business … And to me today the stock really reflects a lot of risks that have been embedded in that stock"" Dunn said. Year-to-date shares in Alcoa are down around 40%. However Dunn said the stock stands to gain from ""a lot of upside"" from an increase in supply following energy restraints in China. The Asian powerhouse has been facing an energy crisis following a shortage of coal and has since been ramping up the production of aluminum a key ingredient in coal production. Dollar Tree Elsewhere the value investor is bullish on value store Dollar Tree  which made up almost 3% of the U.S. Value Fund holdings as of Oct. 31. The company — which acquired Family Tree in 2015 for almost $9 billion — has faced challenges around worker safety this year . However Dunn believes the company's new management team is equipped to turn things around and ""drive earnings growth."" So far the team has already made tweaks to the store format and price points of products. ""That's a situation again opportunistic value where we can find a business like that [which] we think is trading below intrinsic value has a lot opportunity from the great management team to repair the business and to make it a much better business than it is today"" he said. Clorox In the consumer sector Dunn is watching Clorox  which produces bleach and other household products. The company faced some difficulties this year including a cyber attack and disruption to some of its IT platforms. It led Clorox's stock price to slide significantly . Year-to-date shares are now up nearly 1% but this is "" well under its intrinsic value"" Dunn said. Other merits of the company include having the ""best management team in the business"" and an ""excellent balance sheet"" he added. ""We like to buy businesses like this when there's a disruption and we deem that what we call opportunistic value ... And Clorox is a great example that you have a disruption from a cyber attack and really the core business is very strong"" Dunn said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5saXZlbWludC5jb20vbWFya2V0L3N0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1uZXdzL2Fzc2VtYmx5LWVsZWN0aW9uLXJlc3VsdHMtMjAyMy1ob3ctd2lsbC10aGUtaW5kaWFuLXN0b2NrLW1hcmtldC1yZWFjdC0xMTcwMTYxNDI0ODE0Mi5odG1s0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmVtaW50LmNvbS9tYXJrZXQvc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LW5ld3MvYXNzZW1ibHktZWxlY3Rpb24tcmVzdWx0cy0yMDIzLWhvdy13aWxsLXRoZS1pbmRpYW4tc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LXJlYWN0L2FtcC0xMTcwMTYxNDI0ODE0Mi5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Assembly election results 2023: How will the Indian stock market react? | Mint,"The Bharatiya Janata Party is set to form governments in three states—Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh—out of the five that went to polls recently. The Indian National Congress won in Telangana while Mizoram’s results are due tomorrow. Check the latest numbers here.

While too much should not be extrapolated from state assembly elections as they typically revolve on local issues the current ones are different. One they came very close to the 2024 General Election scheduled for May next year where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will be defending his two-term Government at the hustings. A loss for BJP would have put it under significant pressure. Stock markets would have begun worrying.

Two these elections were a test of the Congress’s resurgence. The party’s victory in Karnataka Assembly election had generated a lot of hope that it will be the beginning of its comeback. Its leader Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo yatra many thought has put the party on a winning run. Immediately after Congress’s Karnataka victory opposition parties came together to form the I.N.D.I.A alliance in a bid to unseat BJP at the Centre. The future of this alliance depended a lot on the outcome of these elections.

Here we present for you the five key takeaways from the just concluded State assembly elections.

Hindi heartland firmly with BJP

Of the 519 assembly seats in play in Madhya Pradesh Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh the BJP has won or is leading in over 330 seats. In Madhya Pradesh the party has overcome anti-incumbency despite being in power for four terms. The Congress on the other hand could not retain power after just a single term in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. Such a show just four months before the forthcoming 2024 Lok Sabha elections means the BJP is on a very strong footing as it fights for a third term under Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Congress’ resurgence stopped in its tracks

The Congress’s victory in the Karnataka Assembly elections in May led to the formation of I.N.D.I.A — an opposition alliance involving over two dozen political parties. Their aim is to dislodge the BJP government at the Centre in the 2024 elections. However this comprehensive loss to BJP in the Hindi heartland might well have ended the short-lived Congress resurgence.

Impact on the I.N.D.I.A alliance

Congress’ loss especially where it was head-to-head with BJP will considerably weaken its position in the I.N.D.I.A alliance. Many regional parties such as Trinamool Congress AAP JD(U) and others are the greatest beneficiaries of this loss. They will now demand a greater say and seats in the alliance. Such a move will considerably weaken the alliance efforts to project a cohesive opposition that can when elected offer a stable Government. BJP will find it easy to play the instability card and win votes. This Congress defeat in the Hindi heartland will at best weaken the alliance and at worst break it.

The North-South divide

Congress’ only consolation is its victory in Telangana where it has comfortably defeated a two-term Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) government. It benefited from the anti-incumbency that BRS faced after being in power for 10 years since the formation of Telangana state. BJP for its part has gained vote share. This victory clearly showed that Congress still has clout South of the Vindhyas. It won Karnataka in May and now Telangana.

Can Congress’ strength in the South be good enough to take on BJP in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections? The South has just 130 seats of the total 543 Lok Sabha seats nationally. Thus a strong performance in the South may not be enough. The Congress needs to do well in the Hindi heartland and other parts of the country.

BJP on the other hand needs a `South Strategy’ if it has to do very well in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. It is a non-entity in Tamil Nadu and Kerala. It has done well to stitch an alliance with JD(S) in Karnataka after its loss in May. The electoral arithmetic favours the BJP-JD(S) alliance in the Lok Sabha polls. BJP needs similar measures in other Southern states.

What do these election results mean for the stock markets?

The election outcome will surely please the stock markets with experts predicting a strong opening tomorrow. Stock markets clearly want stability and BJP’s performance in the recent State Assembly elections especially in the Hindi heartland — its core vote base—should give a boost to the markets.

A strong BJP would mean a stable government while an I.N.D.I.A alliance with a weak Congress can at best offer a rickety coalition. A stable government and policy continuity would be key positives and lead to further upsides in the market. Moreover the results would also assuage concerns that losses for BJP would set off a spiral of competitive populism in the country with adverse long-term fiscal consequences as this Mint Snapview points out.

“A decisive BJP win will reinforce the consensus view that the party is on the front foot for the 2024 general elections. This will likely add a further leg of the rally to the markets as policy continuity will be viewed as a positive growth shock in the medium term"" said Emkay Global Securities.

On Friday the Nifty hit a record 20291.55 during the day thanks to stellar GDP growth of 7.6% in the second quarter and positive cues from state exit polls. It closed at an all-time high of 20267.90 up 0.67%.

In a 13 November note Morgan Stanley said that a decisive BJP victory in the Lok Sabha elections in May next year could see BSE Sensex rising by 10%. A BJP defeat and emergence of a coalition Government will trigger a 40% fall in Sensex.

Foreign currency strategists at Morgan Stanley expect that the Euro to Dollar (EUR/USD) exchange rate will slide to parity by the end of the first quarter of 2024.Wells Fargo expects that the dollar will lose ground in 2024 with the Euro to Dollar (EUR/USD) exchange rate at 1.11 at the end of 2024.There was choppy dollar and Euro trading during the week as markets responded to the flow of data central bank headlines and shifts in interest rate expectations.Overall both currencies struggled with markets pricing in more aggressive rate cuts next year.EUR/USD broke above the 1.10 level for 3-month highs but failed to hold the gains and dipped sharply to 1.0830 lows before settling around 1.0880.According to HSBC; “It seems that those that bought the EUR simply because it is “not the USD” are now buying the USD because it is “not the EUR”.The headline Euro-Zone inflation rate declined sharply to 2.4% from 3.2% previously below consensus forecasts of 2.7% and the lowest reading for over two years.The core rate also declined to 3.6% from 4.2% which was below expectations of 3.9% and the lowest reading since May 2022.Following the data markets priced in more aggressive rate cuts with rates expected to decline by 100 basis points by the end of 2024.HSBC still sees the potential for a more aggressive ECB pushback; “absent major negative surprises on growth we still think it is unlikely that the ECB will be satisfied already by April (or even March) that there is enough evidence of inflation reverting back to 2% in a sustainable manner.”Federal Reserve comments had a big impact earlier in the week.Markets seized on comments by Fed Governor Waller who stated that; “If you see this (lower) inflation continuing for several more months I don’t know how long that might be – say 3mths 4mths 5mths – you could then start lowering the policy rate because inflation is lower”.He added that there’s no reason to keep interest rates at a very high level if inflation is back to target.Waller has been one of the most hawkish Fed members during the past year and these comments suggested a significantly more dovish stance and that he was now more confident that inflation would come under control.There was evidence of significant divisions with fellow Governor Bowman stating that she thought interest rates would still need to increase further to meet the 2% target on a sustained basis.Fed Chair Powell stated that interest rates would be increased again if needed to lower inflation and it’s premature to say that policy is restrictive enough.Powell however stated that the Fed is not in a rush as it is getting what it wanted to get.As far as inflation is concerned the core PCE prices index increased 0.2% on the month with the year-on-year increase declining to 3.5% from 3.7%.This was in line with market expectations and the lowest reading since June 2021.The ISM manufacturing index remained in contraction for the 13th successive month with no change from 46.7 in October while prices declined marginally.Markets however were pricing in over a 50% chance that interest rates would be cut by March with an 85% chance of a cut by May.The Federal Reserve will announce its latest policy decision on December 13th.According to Credit Agricole; “we think that the markets have gone well ahead of themselves pricing in Fed rate cuts. We expect the FOMC to disappoint the dovish market expectations in part because we think that the recent disinflation trend would slow down in the coming months. This could help the USD to consolidate at the start of 2024.”Bank of America (BoA) still expects faster US growth than the rest of the G10 but expects the gap will narrow.According to BoA; “We are confident that the USD will weaken across the board—against all other G10 currencies—if our baseline plays out.”BoA notes potential risks to the scenario and considers that markets may have got ahead of themselves which will delay a dollar reversal.It notes; “We would not necessarily expect more rate hikes if inflation proved stickier than markets expect but Fed cuts may come later than markets are currently pricing particularly following the latest repricing expecting the Fed to start cutting rates as early as March. In this case it will also take longer for the USD to weaken towards its long-term equilibrium.The global outlook will also have an important impact with a particular focus on China.According to Wells Fargo; “Beijing policymakers seem to be finally taking a more determined approach to ring fencing property sector solvency and liquidity risks.A less challenging Chinese backdrop would help underpin the Euro.Wells Fargo added; “With a U.S. dollar peak now seen as closer than previously we believe the approach of market participants will soon transition to one of selling the U.S. dollar on rallies or equivalently buying foreign currencies on dips.”

Morgan Stanley analysts say the Lloyds share price could reach 85p in 2024. But could a possible windfall tax throw a spanner in the works for investors?

Analysts at Morgan Stanley have a target of 64p set for the Lloyds Banking Group (LSE:LLOY) share price. That’s a gain of around 49% from today’s levels.

In a more optimistic outlook the broker thinks Lloyds shares could reach 85p next year – an increase of almost 100%. But there are also some significant risks with the stock that are worth considering.

The bull case

The bull case is based on two ideas. The first is better returns on new mortgages and the second is lower provisions for loan losses.

Together these could offer a double boost for the bank’s earnings and a potential uplift for the stock. And the thesis is based on the dividend reaching 3p per share in 2024.

If that happens the yield at today’s prices would be around 7% which is very attractive even during a period of high interest rates. So Lloyd shares could also be a good source of passive income.

It’s worth noting that this the best-case scenario considered by the analysts. But at 43p per share the stock could be a good investment at today’s prices even without getting to the 64p target next year.

The bear case

All of this sounds good and I don’t think it’s necessarily unrealistic. There are some big risks to consider though and one in particular that could be especially problematic next year.

Across Europe banks have benefitted from higher interest rates. But their increasing profits have been attracting some unwanted attention from governments.

As a result various countries have chosen to introduce windfall taxes. If something similar happens in the UK banks like Lloyds could find their earnings come in much lower than expected.

The UK is headed for an election next year and politicians on both sides are keeping quiet on the possibility of a windfall tax. That’s a risk that investors ought to consider carefully before buying Lloyds shares.

Warren Buffett

How seriously should investors take the threat of a windfall tax? As is so often the case I think looking to Warren Buffett for guidance is a good idea.

At the start of the year Buffett elected to sell investments in US banks. At the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting he explained his reasoning for this.

The main issue was uncertainty over what the future might look like. Regulation Buffett warned might be in the hands of people whose interests aren’t aligned with those of shareholders.

The possibility of a windfall tax feels strikingly similar to me. And there’s a good case for thinking that investors like me ought to feel about Lloyds shares the same way Buffett feels about US banks.

Risk and reward

The Lloyds share price looks cheap at the moment – and it is. The question for investors is whether that’s because it’s accurately pricing in risks like a windfall tax in the near future.

That’s difficult to judge and this definitely makes it harder to see the stock as a screaming bargain. But I’m keeping a close eye on it for my own portfolio as we approach 2024."
MOS,Mosaic Company,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vZXNjYXBlY29sbGVjdGl2ZS5jb20vY3ljbG9jcm9zcy1nYWxsZXJ5LWZyb20tc3Rhci1nYXppbmctdHJvbGxzLXRvLWEtY2hhdGVhdS1pbi1ub3JtYW5keS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cyclocross gallery: From star-gazing trolls to a château in Normandy,"Besides the tools of the trade and the inherent patterns of racing there aren’t a great number of parallels between cyclocross and events like the Tour de France. However like so much of cycling the CX calendar takes the riders and their diehard fans all over the place offering not just varying terrains and challenges but new cultural sights to explore.

Sure there’s a lot less time available for David Millar or [insert commentator of your choice] to trot out French château information not to mention the significant lack of variation after the first 5-10 minutes as the riders enter lap two but there’s nearly always something to tickle the curiosity even if that just means typing the name of a wintery industrial Belgian town into Google.

Quite often there’s not much to be learned besides a lengthy relationship with cyclocross but this weekend’s visits to Boom and Flamanville have offered more-than-usually picturesque racing against a backdrop of at-least quite interesting culture and/or history.

First was Saturday’s Superprestige round and a now traditional annual visit to the De Schorre park in Boom Belgium home to Tomorrowland one of the world’s most famous music festivals and seven striking giant trolls designed by Danish artist Thomas Dambo. It was bitterly cold but unlike some parts of northern Europe was untouched by snow and the sun’s ageing rays made for stunning scenes as the afternoon wore on.

Not everyone chose to make the trip over to Flamanville on the French Cotentin Peninsula – the unstoppable Fem van Empel joined a sick Ceylin del Carmen Alvarado on the non-starters list for the World Cup’s sixth round – but you might argue that’s a good thing setting up some attritional racing in the loose French mud.

While Van Empel remains seemingly peerless among the elite women the men’s field has laid on some pretty thrilling racing most weekends so far this season. But that’s all about to change (probably) with Wout van Aert set to make his first appearance at Exact Cross in Emmen next weekend and Tom Pidcock and Mathieu van der Poel rejoining the field on 16 and 22 December respectively. Brace yourselves …

One of the features that makes Boom quite such an appealing event to watch: the ‘Stairway to Eternity’ a 60-metre-long hand-laid mosaic stairway chiefly depicting Mother Earth and Mother Nature that sits in the main amphitheatre of the festival grounds. In its entirety there are no less than 700 square metres of hand-cut mosaic pieces more than five million all told. Intended to represent the festival’s value in bringing together people from over 200 countries the work is a collaboration between the Tomorrowland team Cuban artist Michel Herrera Cuello Parisian mosaic expert Jean-Christophe Duperron and traditional Italian mosaic company Mosaici Moruzzi.

As always the women got the elite action underway; Inge van der Heijden (Crelan-Corendon) chases Annemarie Worst (Cyclocross Reds) who had the Superprestige leadership to chase down in Alvarado’s absence.

Sanne Cant navigates her way around the base of the most visible trolls in the park. These two (of seven) are apparently called Una and Juires best friends who love to gaze at the stars and clouds together.

Alicia Franck (De Ceuster-Bonache) had a strong start in Boom alongside Denise Betsema (Pauwels Sauzen-Bingoal) who has enjoyed her strongest weekend of the season thus far with sixth- and fourth-place finishes.

Worst had a good day out third proving enough to take over the Superprestige lead by five points as Alvarado took an unscheduled break.

Puck Pieterse hasn’t raced much yet this season Boom being only her fourth appearance but the Dutch champion always brings form to the races leaping to her third runner-up finish of the year (third in Kortrijk completes her clean sweep of podium finishes so far).

The only way Van Empel can lose is by not turning up.

She’s unstoppable.

Joris Nieuwenhuis is flying at the moment and the 27-year-old has been particularly strong at the recent Superprestige rounds second at Niel being followed up by his biggest win of the season at Merksplas. True to form he arrived in Boom with diamonds in his legs.

European champion Michael Vanthourenhout made his second appearance since dislocating his shoulder riding to fifth at Boom before skipping the trip to France along with many of his peers.

Thibau Nys has shown sparks of the form he carried through October and into November but a heavy weekend on wearing courses seemed to get the better of the young rider.

Having recently moved into an apartment a stone’s throw from the Boom venue Cameron Mason was able to walk to work on Saturday for his ‘new home’ race.

Eli Iserbyt seems not to need a day off which is all very well as he continues to shore up his lead in both Superprestige and World Cup overall competitions.

It was very very cold in Boom and the temperature combined with golden hour made for an atmospheric finish to the men’s race.

Nieuwenhuis held off his rivals to take his second Superprestige win of the season.

Mason fought hard to a brilliant second place 10 seconds behind the winner and 42 seconds ahead of third-place Iserbyt.

Over in Flamanville where the temperature was a balmy 8-10°C Lucinda Brand was the top favourite with Van Empel Pieterse and Alvarado all staying home.

French national champion Hélène Clauzel (AS Bike Racing) was a popular rider on the French course.

Sanne Cant had a weekend of distinctly mixed fortunes netting eighth in Boom before being forced to DNF shortly after a heavy fall during World Cup Flamanville.

After a tricky start for many on the slimy mud Luxembourg national champion Marie Schreiber enjoyed an early lead while Brand was forced to chase from further back than she’d have liked.

The Dutch veteran was unfazed though leapfrogging through the field until she reached Schreiber doing so a little sooner than she might have after the younger rider slid out. The two rode together for about as long as it takes to draw breath before Brand put the hammer down with a trademark hit and was never seen again.

This weekend marked a return to CX for a number of riders including Shirin van Anrooij who’s back racing for the first time since the US trip. The Dutch rider had a slow start but fought back to a remarkable fifth place after finding herself on the very back of the bunch in the first lap.

Behind Brand World Cup Flamanville was a big day for the youngsters in the field 19-year-old Leonie Bentveld and 20-year-old Schreiber both climbing onto their first elite podium.

Blanka Vas raced her first full weekend a week after her season debut taking seventh and 13th at Boom and Flamanville respectively.

In the men’s race Toon Vandebosch enjoyed a characteristic fast start before slipping to 11th by the end of the race.

Early on Pim Ronhaar got a decent wedge of fresh air ahead of a dangerous group of favourites.

Lars van der Haar and Joris Nieuwenhuis plugged away on the French course sweeping around the imposing Château de Flamanville and alongside its pond dodging geese and flares on their way to top-five finishes.

Kevin Kuhn turned a powerful start which saw him take an early lead before Ronhaar took over into a strong sixth-place finish.

Ronhaar began to fade as the laps chalked up and with about half the race to go Iserbyt seemed to shift gear leaving behind his fellow chasers and powering his way up to Ronhaar before taking over the race lead.

In his own words Iserbyt was able to “grow into the race” and finish with a decent cushion “but very tired”.

A late surge saw Van der Haar overtake his teammate for second – Ronhaar told media he was a “a dying swan” by the finish “I almost fell off the podium” – and was a picture of exhaustion at the finish line.

Another weekend done time to warm up and recover.

Years in the making the artwork depicts the £1bn R&D building from the air and stretches across 26 square metres.

Artist Helen Marshall founder of the People’s Picture was commissioned by AstraZeneca to create the work.

She told the Cambridge Independent at the launch: “I’m really pleased with it. We started about two and a half years ago. I was matched as a suitable artist with AstraZeneca because they wanted to create a solitary artwork that pulled together all the children’s artwork that was being created as part of their STEM community programme.

“I’ve been collecting and processing thousands of images by contributors and the public for years and creating art - photo mosaics - out of them.

There are 5000 images in total in the mosaic. Picture: Keith Heppell

“The biggest challenge of all was what image was it going to be. We explored many images with different viewpoints but I felt strongly that the building would be the final image.

“It is an iconic building. The images taken from the air by drone are spectacular. But no one can see the building from above when they enter it.

“I’m always looking for an iconic image. It couldn’t be a face - it would be too personal. Equally something like a scientific symbol could date.

The mosaic project took about two and a half years to complete. Picture: Keith Heppell

“It’s a celebration of not just the building but of people coming together - the sum of the parts.

“The artwork is made of over 1000 pictures but we’ve repeated them so there are over 5000 in it. But every image is unique because we’ve changed the colours and the effects.

“The kids did art sessions last summer and were given inspirational questions and ideas. They used mixed media material. Then we collected and scanned the paper artworks and digitised them.

“There are humorous images there are self-portraits there are patterns and shapes test tubes there are parts of the body like organs cells molecules - all sorts of things.”

Helen is intrigued by the intersection of art and science.

“My process is a combination of digital technology building things by hand scanning the original images and doing 100 tests - much like a scientist would really. It’s experimentation until I get something close to what I like. Then it’s a case of polishing it for weeks and months on end” she said.

“I think art and science have always had a great deal in common since the dawn of time but it’s been hard to build a bridge for some reason.

“This is evidence that we work in similar ways. Like scientists doing clinical trials I’m working with precision and using technology for predictive outcomes and I’m working in the unknown as they are.

“But this is the visual world which is much more about feeling and intuition and expression.”

Congratulating all those whose work made it into the piece some of whom were at the launch she added: “It has been a privilege to work alongside a team of scientists with such dedication to the participants and open minds to the artistic outcome where experimentation is playful and there is an implicit trust in the process.”

Susan Galbraith executive vice president of oncology R&D told the Cambridge Independent: “I think it’s fabulous - really inspirational. You can go in really close and see the interesting details that the kids have drawn. Then you step back and you see the totality of it together in the shape of the building.

“I think that’s really symbolic of how science works. We quite often zoom in to the tiniest detail but you have to come back out and understand the implications.

“I also love the fact that it is borne out of the curiosity and imagination of all of these kids put together brilliantly by Helen Marshall seeing the bigger picture.

“I think it will be inspirational for all of our staff as they come into this fabulous building and see it as a reminder to keep curious which is what inspired you to do science in the first place.

“I very much hope that some of the children involved will turn into scientists. Who knows - maybe some of them will come and work here eventually? If we can inspire a few of them to go out into the world and make a difference that would be fabulous.”

Prof Sir Mene Pangalos executive vice president biopharmaceuticals R&D at AstraZeneca added: “Inspiration in science drives breakthroughs in medicine research and we are delighted our new laboratories which are state of the art will be filled with works of art.

“As the largest company in the UK and a vital part of the country’s life sciences ecosystem AstraZeneca is committed to investing in the culture community and economy in Cambridge to support science today and foster the scientists of the future.”

Over 55 companies will be involved in 51 events happening at the Saskatchewan pavilion during the COP28 United Nation climate change conference which began on Thursday and will be attended by Moe and a delegation of Saskatchewan-based businesses the province said in a Thursday news release.

A list of companies and organizations that will be using the Saskatchewan pavilion space at the conference was discussed Friday by the Opposition NDP.

It shows many of the groups using the space are not Saskatchewan-based including companies and organizations like Ontario Power Generation the University of British Columbia Simon Fraser University the Alberta-headquarted energy company Enbridge and Bennett Jones a Toronto-based law firm.

Officials from Turkey Saudi Arabia and Colombia will use the Saskatchewan pavilion's meeting room the list shows.

Saskatchewan-based companies listed to use the pavilion include Black Fox Distillery Hebert Grain Ventures Mosaic Cameco and Nutrien.

The Saskatchewan government spent $765000 on the pavilion space alone — a figure the NDP expects to climb when other expenses for the trip are factored in.

""I think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone in this economy who thinks $765000 for a small room or two small rooms and some chairs is a great deal"" NDP environment critic Jared Clarke said at a press conference on Thursday.

Moe has maintained that the trip is an opportunity to tell Saskatchewan's ""story"" on the global stage.

""The sole focus of all things in our pavilion is going to be a one-stop shop of what we are doing in Saskatchewan and what we are doing in Canada"" Moe said at a Thursday news conference.

The province says during the first week of the conference the Saskatchewan pavilion will focus on energy sustainability. In the second week the theme is sustainable agriculture and food systems.

Moe added that he will be part of a panel along with Alberta Premier Danielle Smith and former British Columbia premier Christy Clark at the event.

But NDP MLA Aleana Young questioned why the Saskatchewan pavilion is being used by out-of-province delegates.

Read part one here.

It was a Wednesday at 7 a.m. during holy week in 2015 when Belkys Baez walked up to the medical clinic she owned in Aragua Venezuela and found the head of a corpse in the street near the front door.

She quickly called the cops.

“It was the head of a young fighter who belonged to a guerrilla group called 'Tren de Aragua'” she said. “Police officers the press and scheduled patients were there to witness one of the most traumatic days of my life.”

Not long after that Baez barely escaped a kidnapping attempt. The family believed it was because they had openly expressed their opposition to the regime of President Nicolás Maduro and that the intimidation would keep coming. So in September 2016 Baez her husband Edgardo their 17-year-old son Victor and their daughter Maria headed to the United States where they applied for asylum.

Their case illustrates the difficulties tens of thousands of Venezuelans face in leaving their home country and settling abroad. According to the United Nations 7.3 million have left the country since 2014 and over 1 million Venezuelans have applied for asylum around the globe. Moreover thousands have received temporary protected status or TPS in the United States which President Biden recently extended. Thousands more are being admitted under Biden's humanitarian parole program.

The family’s bold decision to leave everything behind and start from scratch began a journey of both uncertainty and possibility.

Belkys Baez was born on July 20 1966 in Aragua while Edgardo Roa was born on March 28 1966 in Merida. Both graduated from Universidad de los Andes; her degree was in bioanalysis and his degree was in mechanical engineering. Their first child Maria Gabriela arrived on September 9 1994 in Aragua and Victor came in 1998 the same year Hugo Chavez took over the government in Venezuela.

Baez had three health centers in Aragua; all were affected by the insecurity and inflation in the country which caused the closing of two. At the same time Edgardo worked as a contractor Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.

It was about this time Edgardo started to encounter issues at work due to his political views. This ended up with him being constantly chased and made the family feel insecure. Edgardo and Belkys both expressed their feelings of despair at watching everything they had worked hard to build over the years being destroyed by the impact of socialism. In particular they found it especially difficult to witness the critical point that Venezuela reached in 2016 affecting the economy social and healthcare sectors.

When combined with Belkys’s discovery of the head and the kidnapping attempt it became clear the time to leave the country had come.

“I love my country and I never wanted to abandon it” said Baez. “But all those horrible experiences were signs sent by God saying it was time to leave.”

Victor now 24 has had a particularly informative journey. It indicates the kinds of difficulties young professional immigrants can experience.

Born and raised in Aragua he has always had clear goals. So even as a teenager he pushed his family to come to Miami. Victor finished high school very young and started university. Still there was always something interrupting his studies and that was one of the multiple factors that made him realize there was no future for him in Venezuela.

“I just said to my parents one day that I was gonna leave the country with or without them” said Victor. “After everything that happened to my family and the constant obstacles in my university studies I knew there wasn’t a future for me there.”

“I love my country and I never wanted to abandon it. But all those horrible experiences were signs sent by God saying it was time to leave.” Victor Baez



The first year 2016 was rough. They applied for asylum and no family member could work legally because they were waiting for employment authorization.

The eldest child Maria returned to Venezuela after a few months. She had started a career in communications in Venezuela that she felt was worth resuming.

Baez expressed how hard it was to watch her leave.

“It was like missing a leg from a table” Baez said. “We had a family project here but she was unhappy and I didn’t want her to suffer.”

Victor and Edgardo managed to get cash jobs—Victor in a car wash and Edgardo in construction. Belkys works for Instacart.

“Of course it was a risk” Victor said. “I was unsure about my status and job; every day could’ve been when I didn’t have a job anymore or even worse.”

Despite the circumstances Victor did not stop pursuing his dreams. He took ESOL classes and improved his English while working in the car wash. He finally received his employment authorization in 2017.

Then he got a full-time job as a bakery clerk in a Publix near an apartment the family was renting on Coral Way and continued to pursue his career at Miami Dade College.

“It was a challenge” Victor says between laughs. “I used to work from 4 a.m. until 1 p.m. and then I had my classes in the evening.”

Courtesy of Amelia Orjuela Da Silva / FIU Caplin News Victor holding his country’s flag.

While studying Victor succeeded in many aspects but experienced many difficult times.

Edgardo took a job in West Palm Beach in 2018. Victor had to become independent and start his adulthood without his family. Though difficult the experience helped Victor grow and become more self-sufficient.

While pursuing his bachelor’s degree he was promoted in 2020 to bakery assistant manager at Publix. The pandemic hit Miami in March of 2020 and classes went remote.

Victor had a tough year in 2021. He secured an internship at Motorola Solutions which helped him advance his career.

In March 2021 President Biden granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) to thousands of Venezuelans living in the United States. The whole family applied in the first wave. However the process took six months for approval. The same year Victor had to renew his employment authorization the same year but because of the pandemic many immigration processes were delayed including his work permit which should have arrived by May 2021 but it did not.

Immigration authorities allowed many like Victor to work with the granted extensions due to the delay. However Victor still had not received his employment authorization when the extension ended one day before Thanksgiving. As a result he lost his dream job the worst Thanksgiving ever.

Victor knew that TPS could be a lifesaver but without the work permit it was a dream that seemed far to achieve. However once Victor’s work permit arrived that designation would protect him for at least 18 months from the nightmare of being deported.

“TPS is a benefit that allows Venezuelans to work legally in this country without the fear of an asylum interview that depends solely on the decision of an immigration officer” said Victor.

Currently there are 242700 recipients of TPS in the country. The Department of Homeland Securityestimates that 472000 additional Venezuelans will be granted the benefit after Biden extended the program this past September.

Immigration attorney Lupe Lafont explains how TPS is helping people with affirmative asylum who are still waiting for a call on their asylum claim just like Victor.

“TPS is basically a good protection in case you are called for an interview and the asylum is referred to court” she said.

Though TPS was extended for many those Venezuelans who illegally entered the country after July 31 and have not been granted safe migratory status will be repatriated to Venezuela. The first flight took off after Venezuela’s opposition and government agreed on Oct. 17 2023 presidential elections for next year.

In January 2022 Victor received his long-awaited work permit. With determination and a desire to build his future he resumed his job as a service operations assistant at Motorola Solutions. Not only that he also earned his bachelor’s degree in data analytics at Miami Dade College in April 2022.

Now he is pursuing a second bachelor’s degree in business administration and business analytics. He has also been promoted to relationship and support business operations readiness analyst.

He says he plans to move to Chicago soon and expresses that he tries to honor his country daily.

“Even though I’ve been here for more than seven years and I love living in the United States I’m a proud Venezuelan who wants to leave my country at the top of the list” states Victor.

Global financial markets achieved substantial gains during November as investors took confidence from falling inflation and hopes interest rates have peaked.

The MSCI All-Country World index increased by 9 per cent last month its best result since late 2020 when results from a Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine trial showed the jab was highly effective in protecting people from the Covid-19 virus.

Wall Street was the big winner with the tech-heavy Nasdaq achieving double-digit gains and the S&P 500 jumping 8.7 per cent amid optimism that the Federal Reserve would implement interest rate cuts sooner than previously expected.

Modest growth: Britain's FTSE 100 and FTSE 250 indices had a comparatively weak month relative to others although they still achieved growth

European markets also had a robust November with the Stoxx 600 rebounding from three straight months of losses to grow by 6.45 per cent according to the London Stock Exchange Group.

Fresh data on Thursday revealed eurozone inflation dropped to 2.4 per cent last month much lower than forecast and reviving investor predictions of rate cuts in the new year.

Britain's most prominent indices had a comparatively weak month relative to others although they still achieved growth.

The blue-chip FTSE 100 ended November at 7453.75 just 1.8 per cent higher than in late October while the FTSE 250 rose 6.7 per cent to 18233.5.

The former index was supported by a late rally on Thursday from financial aerospace and defence stocks such as Rolls-Royce Holdings which was one of its best performers during the month.

Energy shares including oil supermajors BP and Shell provided an additional boost after OPEC announced a production output cut of one million barrels per day.

London's mid-cap index enjoyed its strongest month this year with travel stocks like low-cost airline EasyJet and cruise operator Carnival among the best performers.

Commercial real estate groups such as shopping centre owners Hammerson and British Land also saw bumper gains as borrowing costs eased.

Analysts expect this momentum to maintain itself over the Christmas holidays in anticipation of high consumer spending as well as weaker share dealing volumes over the period that typically reduces the risk of a sell-off.

Tom Stevenson investment director for personal investing at Fidelity International said: 'While market superstitions and seasonal adages are rightly viewed with a hint of scepticism the ""Santa Rally"" appears to be the gift that just keeps on giving.'

He added: 'The yuletide market surge could be due to several factors; thin trading volumes around the Christmas holidays may amplify market moves.

'The tendency of markets to rise more frequently than they fall might contribute to the holiday cheer.'

Analysts are increasingly believing markets will have a soft landing next year rather than a recession although this will be dependent on whether interest rates and inflation come down as hoped.

In the UK the Bank of England is expected to start reducing the base rate from its current 5.25 per cent level given that inflation has already more than halved over the past 12 months.

As stocks and interest rates tend to have an inverse relationship a fall in the latter will likely uplift the former as declining borrowing costs encourage businesses to enhance investment.",,,,,,,,,

We'll use ROE to examine Gilead Sciences Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD) by way of a worked example.

Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity.

Check out our latest analysis for Gilead Sciences

How Is ROE Calculated?

The formula for return on equity is:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So based on the above formula the ROE for Gilead Sciences is:

26% = US$5.8b ÷ US$22b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).

The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity the company generated $0.26 in profit.

Does Gilead Sciences Have A Good Return On Equity?

Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others even within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below Gilead Sciences has a higher ROE than the average (17%) in the Biotechs industry.

roe

That's what we like to see. Bear in mind a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Gilead Sciences by visiting our risks dashboard for free on our platform here.

How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?

Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings) issuing new shares or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options the ROE will reflect this use of cash for growth. In the latter case the debt used for growth will improve returns but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather metaphorically speaking.

Combining Gilead Sciences' Debt And Its 26% Return On Equity

It's worth noting the high use of debt by Gilead Sciences leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.12. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily because credit markets do change over time.

Story continues

Summary

Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal a higher ROE is better.

Having said that while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price must be considered too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.

Of course you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.

(NASDAQ:ILMN) Potentially Undervalued?,"Illumina Inc. ( ) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Illumina’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.

Is Illumina Still Cheap?

The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 19% below my intrinsic value which means if you buy Illumina today you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $136.35 then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Illumina’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market providing a prime buying opportunity.

Can we expect growth from Illumina?

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 67% over the next year the near-term future seems bright for Illumina. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock which should feed into a higher share valuation.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? ILMN’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price with shares trading around its fair value. However there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ILMN now may not be the most optimal time to buy given it is trading around its fair value. However the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

(NASDAQ:MCRB) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 62%,"Key Insights

Given the large stake in the stock by institutions Seres Therapeutics' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions

The top 5 shareholders own 52% of the company

Ownership research along with analyst forecasts data help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Seres Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:MCRB) it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 62% stake institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).

Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight especially with individual investors. Hence having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.

Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Seres Therapeutics.

Check out our latest analysis for Seres Therapeutics

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Seres Therapeutics?

Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register especially if they are growing.

We can see that Seres Therapeutics does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Seres Therapeutics (below). Of course keep in mind that there are other factors to consider too.

Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Seres Therapeutics is not owned by hedge funds. Flagship Pioneering is currently the largest shareholder with 18% of shares outstanding. In comparison the second and third largest shareholders hold about 15% and 7.4% of the stock.

Our research also brought to light the fact that roughly 52% of the company is controlled by the top 5 shareholders suggesting that these owners wield significant influence on the business.

Story continues

Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.

Insider Ownership Of Seres Therapeutics

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members especially if they are a founder or the CEO.

I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.

Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Seres Therapeutics Inc. in their own names. It appears that the board holds about US$1.2m worth of stock. This compares to a market capitalization of US$134m. Many investors in smaller companies prefer to see the board more heavily invested. You can click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public who are usually individual investors hold a 13% stake in Seres Therapeutics. While this group can't necessarily call the shots it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.

Private Equity Ownership

With a stake of 18% private equity firms could influence the Seres Therapeutics board. Some might like this because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times private equity is selling out having taking the company public.

Public Company Ownership

Public companies currently own 5.8% of Seres Therapeutics stock. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.

Next Steps:

It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Seres Therapeutics better we need to consider many other factors. For instance we've identified 3 warning signs for Seres Therapeutics (2 are potentially serious) that you should be aware of.

But ultimately it is the future not the past that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

Nevertheless it was a tough year for solar stocks in 2023 as a strapped U.S. consumer grappled with inflation and higher interest rates created a tougher lending environment for growth-fueled companies.

That said the market for solar power is expected to increase. According to this report the global solar power market is projected to clock an impressive CAGR of 14.9% between 2023 and 2032 reaching roughly $678.81 billion over the next decade.

With this in mind First Solar (FSLR) is one top-rated name in the clean energy group that remains well-positioned to benefit from an improving macro environment going into the year ahead. Let's look at some of the reasons why.

About First Solar

Founded at the turn of the century in 1999 and based out of Arizona First Solar (FSLR) is a multinational solar panel manufacturer with facilities in the U.S. Malaysia and Vietnam. The company pioneered the development of Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) thin-film photovoltaic (PV) modules which offer several advantages over traditional silicon-based modules including higher efficiency lower cost and greater durability.

1. FSLR Stock Outperforms Solar Peers

First Solar stock which currently commands a market cap of about $16.85 billion is up only about 7% on a YTD basis. That lags the performance of both the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite ($NASX) and the broad-based S&P 500 Index ($SPX) so far this year.

However compared to some of its solar stock peers FSLR's share price performance looks quite resilient. While SunPower (SPWR) has corrected by more than 73% in 2023 Solaredge Technologies (SEDG) has fallen by 70% and Enphase Energy (ENPH) is off almost 60%.

Additionally FSLR recently made a successful test of support around $130 which marks a 50% Fibonacci retracement of the rally from its 2020 low to its 2023 high.

www.barchart.com

First Solar stock also looks reasonably valued at current levels. The stock is priced at 19x forward EPS which is below the sector median and its own 5-year average - both around 22x.

2. Q3 Earnings Beat and Raise

First Solar's latest results for Q3 2023 were marked by impressive growth in revenues and a bottom-line beat. The company reported revenues of $801.1 million up 27.4% from the previous year - but slightly short of consensus estimates. The solar specialist swung to a per-share profit of $2.50 from a year-ago loss of $0.46 per share and easily beat the expected EPS of $2.04.

The company's liquidity position also remained robust as it closed the quarter with a cash balance of $1.5 billion well above its long-term debt levels of $464 million.

Looking ahead First Solar raised the midpoint of its fiscal 2023 EPS guidance to $7.60 from $7.50 with the overall range upwardly revised to $7.20-$8.00.

The company's current backlog stands at a record of 81.8 GW which has been sold entirely through 2030 including India and up to 2026 excluding India. This provides substantial revenue visibility for the company.

3. Growth Forecasts Are Bullish

Projected earnings growth for First Solar is expected to stay hot. After reporting $7.98 per share in fiscal 2023 Wall Street is expecting 65% EPS growth in fiscal 2024 to $13.19 per share.

www.barchart.com

FSLR's projected EPS growth along with its expected forward revenue growth of 16% stands well above the sector median. Likewise the company's expected long-term CAGR for EPS growth is 37.7% compared to the 13% industry norm.

4. Analysts See More Upside Ahead

Analysts hold a high opinion of First Solar stock based on the consensus “Strong Buy” rating and mean target price of $232.03. This denotes expected upside potential of about 45% from current levels.

Out of 24 analysts covering the stock 19 have a “Strong Buy” rating (up from 18 a month ago) and five have a “Hold” rating.

5. Fed Rate Cuts Could Be Supportive

Recent economic data has continued to support the case for an eventual Fed pivot in 2024. For example U.S. GDP growth topped expectations in the third quarter while the central bank's preferred inflation gauge shows evidence of moderating price pressures.

As a result the CME FedWatch tool is currently pricing in about 97% odds that the Fed's benchmark rate will be at least 25 basis points lower by the time the June 2024 meeting wraps up. Barring any major economic catastrophes the increasing likelihood of rate cuts next year should bode well for growth stocks across the board including solar companies like First Solar.

(NASDAQ:AMD)?,"Let's talk about the popular Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). The company's shares led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Advanced Micro Devices’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.

View our latest analysis for Advanced Micro Devices

What's The Opportunity In Advanced Micro Devices?

According to my valuation model Advanced Micro Devices seems to be fairly priced at around 7.3% below my intrinsic value which means if you buy Advanced Micro Devices today you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $130.99 then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Advanced Micro Devices’s share price is quite volatile we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.

Can we expect growth from Advanced Micro Devices?

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Advanced Micro Devices' earnings over the next few years are expected to double indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows feeding into a higher share value.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? AMD’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price with shares trading around its fair value. However there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on AMD now may not be the most advantageous time to buy given it is trading around its fair value. However the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

Here's the one Netflix show you need to watch first,"If you love tech half as much as me you probably splurged waaaay too much on Black Friday . Hey I’ll never judge. And if you happened to treat yourself to one of the best OLED TVs  may I offer you hearty congratulations. You’re officially the proud owner of a product you’ll never regret buying.

Now let me recommend the one show you absolutely must watch on said shiny new display first.

Let me cut to the chase: your eyeballs need to witness Life on Our Planet on Netflix. It’s astonishing viewing for multiple reasons. For one thing it gets the old Jurassic Park ILM band back together who predictably create exactly the sort of electrifying results you’d expect from the pioneers behind circa-1993 CGI.

Life on Our Planet is an astonishingly good nature documentary""

Life on Our Planet is also just an astonishingly good nature documentary that does something I’ve never witnessed before: It seamlessly blends amazing computer generated effects with real-world animal footage to craft a 4.5-billion-year-spanning tale of the evolution of wildlife on our spinning rock.

The other poker-winning card this doc has up its sleeve? That would be Morgan Freeman. For my money only James Earl Jones and Sean Connery’s distinctive vocal cords can match Mr. Shawshank Redemption. His guttural yet calming narration is the tonic my soul needs after buying the amazing LG G3 OLED two months too early. If I’d just waited until Black Friday/Cyber Monday season I could have saved myself $1000. But hey-ho. I’ll try to cheer myself up by picturing Shawshank’s incredible beach finale.

Back to Life on our Planet. What. A. Show. It dovetails between iconic eras perfectly. From the first amoebas slithering out of the sea to modern humans hunting down buffalo with brutal efficiency it’s the most compelling nature show I’ve ever watched. Well outside of anything involving a certain Sir David Frederick Attenborough of course.

As I mentioned previously the main selling point that comes from watching these eight captivating episodes that sum up the evolution of the only known life in the cosmos — other than having Red in your ear for close to 10 hours of TV — is that marvelous melding of CGI and real animal footage.

The effects on display are so good sometimes it’s hard to make the distinction between what was created by a computer and what some poor camera person probably had to spend 17 hours straight in a high hide to capture.

The time-hopping chronology is awesome once you get to grips with the show’s cadence. One minute you’ll watch Smilodon take a chunk out of a Terror Bird’s neck then it’s on to the habits of modern day frogs before cutting back to a couple of Tyrant Lizard Kings getting sexy before that asteroid made the Earth go kaboom for a time.

The time-hopping chronology is awesome once you get to grips with the show’s cadence""

Switching back to the OLED-viewing aspect I can’t think of another streaming show that looks quite this good. Certainly not one that involves so much immaculate CGI imagery.

The transfer on this show is impeccable.

There’s barely a hint of film grain making this one of the cleanest looking pieces of television I’ve ever watched on any OLED TV. It’s just a remarkably good-looking series that demands to be watched on a high-end television; whether you purchased one on Cyber Monday or pulled the trigger on your AV mega purchase too soon like myself.

On occasion ‘round these parts we sometimes encourage people to cancel Netflix. That’s absolutely not the case in this instance. If anything I’d re-subscribe/sign up to the megaton streaming service (even only for a month) to watch this astoundingly made piece of programming.

Turns out when you throw together the best CGI team in the biz T-Rex and Morgan Freeman the results are predictably unmissable. Whether you own a 15-year old CRT or the superb Samsung S95C QD-OLED I can’t stress enough how much you need Life on Our Planet in… well your “life.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZm94NXNhbmRpZWdvLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3doYXRzLW5ldy1vbi1uZXRmbGl4LWRlY2VtYmVyLTIwMjMv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3g1c2FuZGllZ28uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvd2hhdHMtbmV3LW9uLW5ldGZsaXgtZGVjZW1iZXItMjAyMy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What’s new on Netflix in December 2023?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://fox5sandiego.com/entertainment/whats-new-on-netflix-december-2023/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vZm94NXNhbmRpZWdvLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L3doYXRzLW5ldy1vbi1uZXRmbGl4LWRlY2VtYmVyLTIwMjMv0gFOaHR0cHM6Ly9mb3g1c2FuZGllZ28uY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvd2hhdHMtbmV3LW9uLW5ldGZsaXgtZGVjZW1iZXItMjAyMy9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vdW5pdmVyc2l0eXN0YXIuY29tLzI0NTkwL29waW5pb25zL25ldGZsaXhzLW5ldy1ob3VzZWhvbGQtcnVsZXMtYXJlLXVucmVhc29uYWJsZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Netflix's new “household” rules are unreasonable – The University Star,"Illustration by Delaney Compean

In February Netflix announced it was going to begin cracking down on password sharing across households starting in Canada New Zealand Portugal and Spain. Now Texas State students have started to lose access to their shared Netflix accounts.

Netflix defines a “household” as people who live in the same location as the original owner of the account. According to a statement from Netflix over 100 million households are sharing passwords which impacts Netflix’s “ability to invest in great new TV and films.”

Account owners are now required to set up a primary location on their TV. Users can access the account on a phone or laptop while traveling but streaming on a TV can only be done in the specified household.

While it is fair to say Netflix is addressing a real problem this answer is not fair to college students who are not able to afford their own Netflix accounts. There must be a better solution that allows for more than one household on a single account.

Taylor Estes a psychology freshman is an out-of-state student. She was using her aunt’s Netflix account on her TV in her dorm before she was removed from the account.

“I got on my TV and it said that I was out of my household” Estes said. “I could either change my address or I could send an email to the account that I [was logged into] to get a code to get back into it. I like to turn on Netflix to do my homework so not being able to get into that was kind of a disadvantage for me because I feel like I wasn’t getting anything done.”

Students who rely on family or friends for their accounts will now have to get their own or ask those who live in the original household to pay an extra $7.99 per month for each additional person. Many college students are already on a tight budget and though Netflix now offers a “standard with ads” plan starting at $6.99 per month this pricing still isn’t feasible for some students.

It seems like these new rules are just a cash grab on Netflix’s part. The company just recently raised its U.S. prices again. Premium plans now cost $22.99 per month. Though the company may think these are wise decisions they’re just going to cause more and more people to cancel their accounts altogether.

“No college kid wants to have to pay for Netflix especially on top of everything else they have to worry about” Estes said.

The time has come for Netflix officials to open their eyes and realize that these business moves aren’t helping anyone. As Netflix once said in a tweet “Love is sharing a password” and anyone should be able to do what they wish with their accounts.

“I just think it’s unfair because if someone is willing to share their password their username their account with you there’s obviously a reason” Estes said. “It’s not like it’s causing any harm. It’s just annoying that taking [accounts] away is something that they thought would be a good idea.”

On Wednesday Netflix will unveil its latest live experience based on the dystopian hit show in which desperate South Koreans competed in a brutal contest of simple schoolyard games for a prize of 45.6 billion won (around $38 million). Winners moved closer to the money. Losers died. The live attraction mimics both the popular iconography of the series — the massive piggy bank filled with cash a giant animatronic doll named Young-hee the sterile white dormitory — and the childish games.

For $30 fans of “Squid Game” will compete in some 70 minutes of play with moral twists and turns and six group activities including the schoolyard race Red Light Green Light and a nonlethal version of the series’ terrifying Glass Bridge challenge which forced contestants to choose between two clear squares for each step across a bridge. If they chose incorrectly they descended hundreds of feet to their death.

To feel even more like a character on the show customers can buy a tracksuit for $50 and wear it during the experience. There is also a $100 V.I.P. ticket option: In a nod to the original you can watch the unfortunate masses compete in the games while you sip cocktails in a swanky lounge."

That magical jackpot might be a pipe dream but casinos are the springboard for hope for people who keep coming back.

To some eyes Cripple Creek is on a roll with new townhomes apartments and the 300-room Chamonix Hotel scheduled to open next month.

But the dark side is visible in the tents and the trailers shadowing the building boom.

Mike Olson a fourth-generation gold miner feels like a victim as he has halted mining gold and turquoise on property for which he is a caretaker on Mineral Hill now a tent city.

“We haven’t worked up here in six years” he said. “I’ve had to take a job because of this when I should be mining.”

The properties above the city have several owners: Teller County Newmont Mining Corp. Bureau of Land Management Harriet and David Graham who own Bad Boys Mining the city of Cripple Creek and Shannon Murphy among them.

When he tours the property Olson carries a rifle and a handgun fearing he’ll be shot if he disturbs a campsite.

“We traded picks and shovels for rifles” Olson said.

The roads are rutted with a few recreational vehicles scattered here and there. Recently the engine of the large trommel was destroyed thus making the $200000 machine used to separate mining materials useless Olson said.

The debris of needles a stuffed animal toys an elk skin old trailers and cars around each campsite give hints about the occupants.

“See that black car over there? It’s stolen” Olson said. “We can’t do anything about it because we don’t own the vehicle.”

Olson complains that on the county-owned land the Teller County Sheriff’s Office hasn’t done anything about the campers.

“We have no authority to run them out of there” said Lt. Wes Walter. “This is a civil process where the owner of the property has to work with us.”

Last week Newmont Mining did go ahead with a request to the Sheriff’s Office to prosecute Kenneth Crofford who was subsequently charged with third-degree criminal trespass.

Crofford was living in a camper on property owned by Newmont. The trespassing issue came to light when Crofford’s pit bull came running down the hill toward Olson and Graham.

Put off by the yelling and screaming of the two men the pit bull went for Graham’s Chihuahua. With the dog about to chomp down on the little dog Olson allegedly shot the pit bull with his AR-15 ultimately killing the dog.

“Olson has a right to defend himself” Walter said. “Newmont asked us to go ahead and prosecute Crofford.”

Olson says that he wanted to take care of the mess on the sites.

“We were going to come in with front-end loaders and demolish all the properties” Olson said. “The Sheriff’s Office said ‘do not do that.’”

The Sheriff’s Office can issue tickets for illegal camping Walter said.

“But until a judge signs a warrant we can’t arrest them” he added.

Last year Teller County commissioners passed an ordinance that limits camping on private property by the owners to 60 days.

A permit is required for camping on vacant land and a recreational vehicle must have current licensing and registration. The ordinance establishes the Teller County Sheriff’s Office as the appropriate enforcer of the ordinance.

Featured Local Savings

But the junk and the trailers are another story.

“Even if we did arrest them we’re not moving the trailers” Walter said.

Many of the campers come into the Aspen Mine Center for help. A nonprofit organization the center offers opportunities for clients to be responsible citizens. The only requirement is a desire to make improvement.

“We have a policy based on the camping ordinance” said Lisa Noble the center’s director of client programs. “If they violate the ordinance we will not assist them with propane or gas vouchers. If they are hungry we will feed them.”

For clients who are willing to work on a plan the Aspen Mine Center offers services that include addiction and financial counseling.

“As long as they try to be productive members of society we can help them” Noble said. “We are not enablers.”

“The illegal camping is an issue” said Cripple Creek Police Chief Bud Bright. “It’s no secret I don’t think they have permission to be up there. Some of them have been there for a couple years.”

If Bright and his officers find a camper on city property rather than issuing a ticket the officers urge them to move.

“The city is working on how to address this problem which is good” Bright said referring to an ordinance in the works.

While some camping infractions are on county land Bright keeps track of what's going on.

“The equipment owned by one landowner has been torn up or stolen” he said adding that a $20000 motor on a trommel had been destroyed. “It’s frustrating for the people around there; for people who want to develop their properties the campers make it difficult.”

As he encounters campers on the street Bright listens to their stories. At least two campers work at a local casino.

“They are doing the best they can but illegal camping is not the right answer” Bright said. “I understand the frustration of the surrounding neighbors. They pay taxes.”

For some landowners the situation seems hopeless especially to the landowner who installed a gate and a camera on his property.

“But somebody pulled the gate out and stole the camera” Bright said.

While most of the illegal camping is on county property the city feels the effects.

“It does affect us because we typically respond to help. If the county calls for help we go” he said.

Teller County deputies arrested two of the campers on Nov. 18 each with a warrant signed by a judge Walter said.

Harriet Graham sees the dark side of a city on the move.

“The homeless are drug users who go into Cripple Creek to buy drugs and sell them” she said. “We find needles up here.”

If gamblers come to the city to try their luck so too do those who live on Mineral Hill.

“They sneak in at night and try to mine turquoise” Graham said. “Our turquoise is the best in the world. Less than 5% of turquoise in the world is natural.”

Olson provides security for the Grahams’ property as well as the adjacent mining claim she said.

Graham heard about the two arrests on Nov. 18; each with a warrant.

“I know that people can get in a bad spot but you can’t live on somebody’s else’s property” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0ZnRyZW5kcy5jb20vdGFjdGljYWwtYWxsb2NhdGlvbi1jaGFubmVsL3NlY3Rvci1yZS1yYXRpbmctYS1ib29uLWZvci1nb2xkLXN0b2Nrcy_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldGZ0cmVuZHMuY29tL3RhY3RpY2FsLWFsbG9jYXRpb24tY2hhbm5lbC9zZWN0b3ItcmUtcmF0aW5nLWEtYm9vbi1mb3ItZ29sZC1zdG9ja3MvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sector Re-Rating a Boon for Gold Stocks?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.etftrends.com/tactical-allocation-channel/sector-re-rating-a-boon-for-gold-stocks/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV0ZnRyZW5kcy5jb20vdGFjdGljYWwtYWxsb2NhdGlvbi1jaGFubmVsL3NlY3Rvci1yZS1yYXRpbmctYS1ib29uLWZvci1nb2xkLXN0b2Nrcy_SAWJodHRwczovL3d3dy5ldGZ0cmVuZHMuY29tL3RhY3RpY2FsLWFsbG9jYXRpb24tY2hhbm5lbC9zZWN0b3ItcmUtcmF0aW5nLWEtYm9vbi1mb3ItZ29sZC1zdG9ja3MvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmthbG1pbmVyLmNvbS5hdS9uZXdzL3JlZ2lvbmFsL3RodW5kZXJib3gtZ3J1eWVyZS1idWNrLWdvbGQtcHJvZHVjdGlvbi1kZWNsaW5lLXRyZW5kLWluLXNlcHRlbWJlci1xdWFydGVyLWMtMTI3NzAzMjPSAYMBaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cua2FsbWluZXIuY29tLmF1L25ld3MvcmVnaW9uYWwvdGh1bmRlcmJveC1ncnV5ZXJlLWJ1Y2stZ29sZC1wcm9kdWN0aW9uLWRlY2xpbmUtdHJlbmQtaW4tc2VwdGVtYmVyLXF1YXJ0ZXItYy0xMjc3MDMyMy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Thunderbox Gruyere buck gold production decline trend in September quarter,"Two northern Goldfields mines are among those which bucked the national trend and produced more gold in the September quarter the latest analysis from Surbiton Associates reveals.

The Melbourne-based gold industry consultants said Northern Star Resources’ Thunderbox mine produced 15000 more ounces than it did in the June quarter.

Thunderbox south-east of Leinster has been the focus of an expansion project by Northern Star with the company’s September quarterly report saying the mill continued to ramp-up towards its 6 million tonnes per annum nameplate capacity.

Surbiton said output at Gruyere 160km north-east of Laverton which is run as a 50:50 joint venture by Gold Road Resources and Gold Fields was up by 12000oz.

TheNightly Get in front of tomorrow's news for FREE Journalism for the curious Australian across politics business culture and opinion. READ NOW

Gold Road in October said Gruyere produced a record 88668oz.

Evolution Mining’s Ernest Henry mine in NSW also produced 11000oz more in the September quarter than in June.

But overall Australian gold mines produced five tonnes less gold in September at 75 tonnes.

Although this was 6 per cent below the 80 tonnes recorded in the June quarter it was only about one per cent lower than the September quarter last year Surbiton said.

Newcrest’s Cadia operation in NSW was down 29000oz while Newmont’s Boddington mine north-east of Bunbury produced 28000oz less and Agnico Eagle’s Fosterville operation in Victoria was down 22000oz.

Nevertheless Boddington remained the most productive mine in Australia churning out 181000oz in the September quarter.

Newmont’s Tanami operation in the Northern Territory was second with 123000oz and Cadia was third with 122683oz.

AngloGold Ashanti’s Tropicana mine 330km north-east of Kalgoorlie-Boulder maintained fourth spot producing 110993oz in the September quarter while Northern Star’s Super Pit in Kalgoorlie-Boulder was fifth producing 91525oz.

Australian mine production for the first nine months of 2023 totalled 227 tonnes worth more than $23 billion at current prices.

“Australian dollar gold prices averaged $2945 per ounce in the September quarter just $10 per ounce less than in the June quarter 2023” Surbiton director Sandra Close said.

“These are high prices and as I have often mentioned high gold prices allow operators to reduce head grades by blending low-grade stockpiled material with the run-of-mine ore.”

Dr Close said that choosing to reduce the grade of ore being treated extended the life of the mining operation and allowed the maximum amount of gold to be extracted.

However lower treated grade meant less gold was produced so the costs per ounce rose.

“Just because the cost per ounce increases and the number of ounces produced declines this does not mean that the industry is in trouble” Dr Close said.

“Just using the cost per ounce is not a reliable measure as it fails to take account of varying treatment grades. There are much better performance indicators.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8veWVuLmNvbS5naC9lZHVjYXRpb24vMjQ2ODg4LXVtYXQtZ2hhbmFpYW4tYWR1LWd5YW1maS1uYW1lZC1mZW1hbGUtc3R1ZGVudC1taW5pbmctZW5naW5lZXJpbmctYXdhcmRlZC1naGMxMTAwMC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UMaT: Ghanaian Adu-Gyamfi Named Best Female Student In Mining Engineering Awarded Over GH¢11000 - YEN ...,"Mary Adu-Gyamfi a Ghanaian prodigy graduated as the Best Female Graduating Student in Mining Engineering

While the writing has been on the wall for some time the closure is a blow for those who view the iPad as the savior of the traditional publishing industry.

The Daily: First iPad newspaper shuts down

The iPad’s bump in screen size compared to the iPhone didn’t just mean a larger display to play mobile games. To those in publishing it meant the perfect digital replacement for dying print media — particularly when you factored in Apple’s successful App Store business model.

The Daily went full tilt with this idea. Although dreamed up by an old-school publisher News Corp it was an all-digital newspaper with stories available only on iPad. (It later added support for both the Galaxy Tab and Facebook.)

Rupert Murdoch gave The Daily a weekly budget of $500000. Subscriptions cost 99 cents per week with News Corp receiving 70 cents — plus any advertising revenue the company could generate. Due to News Corp’s size and clout it negotiated Apple’s first recurring payment system for subscriptions.

News Corp launched the service in February 2011 and counted Apple CEO Steve Jobs among its fans and prominent cheerleaders.

Unfortunately it didn’t take long before problems began to emerge. Although it garnered more than 100000 paying subscribers in its first year The Daily lost $30 million. Tidbits’ Adam C. Engs calculated that the paper would need roughly 715000 paid subscribers just to break even.

The Daily suffers major flaws

As with similar attempts to offer news behind paywalls The Daily suffered because it failed to offer content sufficiently different from free outlets.

It also faced a problem with sharing stories since they appeared only in the app. That made it hard for organic growth to happen. On top of this some editions of the digital newspaper ballooned up to 1GB in size and took many users 10 or 15 minutes to download.

Ultimately News Corp decided it wasn’t in it for the long run. In July 2012 it cut 30% of The Daily’s staff. This proved nothing more than a stopgap measure though.

When The Daily closed founding Editor-in-Chief Jesse Angelo moved over to become publisher of News Corp tabloid the New York Post. Some Daily staffers and assorted “technology and other assets” got folded into the Post as well.

“From its launch The Daily was a bold experiment in digital publishing and an amazing vehicle for innovation” Murdoch said in a statement announcing the shutdown. “Unfortunately our experience was that we could not find a large enough audience quickly enough to convince us the business model was sustainable in the long-term.

While inclusion has gained pace only 11.3 per cent (or 3.4 million out of 30 million) Indians with disabilities have jobs. This includes the organised and the unorganised sector government-led schemes and self-employment according to information technology (IT) industry association Nasscom’s June 2023 DE&I (diversity equity and inclusion) landscape study. It was conducted with management services firm Aon and covered about 220 organisations in 14 industries.

Sangeeta Gupta senior vice-president and chief strategy officer Nasscom acknowledges that industries such as services and technology are leading the way with the intentional hiring of PwDs. But India Inc has a long way to go both in increasing representation and driving an equitable and inclusive culture for employees with disabilities she says.

Data from foundit points out that 66 per cent of jobs for PwDs are in IT business process outsourcing and IT-enabled services. About 55 per cent of all jobs meanwhile are at the lower quadrant of the job pool seeking 0-3 years of experience according to the employment solutions company.

Sekhar Garisa chief executive officer foundit says nearly 300 companies have explicitly hired PWDs this year. But issues such as physical barriers in the workplace (lack of ramps elevators or accessible restrooms) hinder them at the workspace. Also companies that lack inclusive policies make it challenging for PwDs to fully participate in the workplace.

“Finding and hiring qualified candidates with disabilities for particular positions can be a hurdle” particularly in industries that historically haven’t prioritised inclusivity Garisa adds.

A positive is that 61 per cent organisations are actively monitoring their PwD diversity according to the Nasscom survey quoted above and companies are engaging with stakeholders to effect changes.

At Flipkart for instance over 2200 PwDs work across its supply chain as team lead data entry operators and sorters. PWDs manage its delivery hubs end-to-end in Delhi and Bengaluru. The e-tailer has also trained 275 employees as sign language interpreters.

“Emergency features are enabled on smartphones of workers with disabilities an emergency number is printed behind the flash cards and reflective jackets and special lanyards for visual identification are provided to them” says Prajakta Kanaglekar vice-president supply chain and customer experience Flipkart.

One of Amazon India’s Mumbai-based delivery stations is also almost completely managed by individuals with speech and hearing impairment. Its fulfilment centres in eight cities employ people with hearing impairments. “We strive to answer questions such as what can we do to avoid exclusion and what can we do to offer people a sense of belonging” says Deepti Varma VP people experience technology Amazon India Japan and Emerging Markets.

Health insurer Niva Bupa has hired 72 PwDs this year. PWDs now form 0.6 per cent of the company’s workforce. “We have found that PwDs have been a good fit for telesales that involve selling new and renewal policies” says Tarun Katyal chief human resources officer (CHRO) Niva Bupa.

General insurer HDFC Ergo meanwhile is seeing the fruits of its hiring programme Project Purple. Its PwD headcount has jumped threefold from last year and their number as a percentage of the workforce has also doubled year-on-year the company said. “Through assistive technology such as text-to-speech software voice assistants videoconferencing tools and screen readers we have been able to ensure ease of work for all” says Sudakshina Bhattacharya president and CHRO HDFC Ergo General Insurance. The company holds sensitisation sessions for its workforce and all PwDs meet monthly with a “project champion” to discuss ways to make the workplace more inclusive and accessible.

Employees with disabilities are also rising up the ladder and companies are making sure to equip them with the right skills and tools.

Marico which currently has members with disabilities across mid to senior levels in sales manufacturing and corporate functions has introduced a programme to strengthen their integration. “This initiative is geared towards creating a consistent talent pipeline nurturing individuals with disabilities internally and preparing them for managerial roles within key business units across our organisation” says Amit Prakash CHRO Marico.

Vedanta which has 40 PwDs among its employees contractors and business partners plans to raise the number to 100. “We are looking to reach out to institutes who focus on PwDs and build a ready talent pipeline for hiring them at Vedanta” says CHRO Madhu Srivastava. The multinational mining company has also engaged external experts and non-governmental organisations that have studied its sites and discussed with the leadership team “mapping roles for PwDs depending on their abilities and nature of job” Srivastava adds.

One consistent theme is that companies are reaching out to their entire workforce with inclusivity initiatives and trying diverse ways to boost accessibility.

Natwest India for instance provides support for diagnosis workplace adjustments assistive tech (such as computer devices that support cognitive disabilities) and coaching for neurodiverse colleagues through specialist qualified partners. The tally of employees with disabilities grew 26 per cent this year at the retail and commercial lender and about 10 per cent of the company’s employees with disabilities are in leadership roles.

“We have colleagues in banking operations across roles like customer service operations delivery and technology roles like software engineers testing analysts and quality automation” says Sheetal Bathija head NatWest India hub.

Additionally over 70 per cent of its India staffers have completed an online module on awareness around disability and recognising and managing unconscious biases. Two batches of over 30 employees have also been trained in sign language.

Business software company Intuit meanwhile is changing its hiring procedures particularly the engineering interviews for neurodivergent individuals who can now share their preferences for coding communication and interview formats. The firm also has an allyship training programme for able-bodied workforce. “We are holding office-hour sessions to provide individuals from the PwD community a confidential platform to discuss concerns with HR professionals or their managers” says Devesh Amin global head of infrastructure and APAC IT Intuit India.

To eliminate unconscious bias professional services firm Accenture holds training sessions for its recruitment teams managers and team members of PwD on disability etiquette and holds experiential learning sessions and assistive technology training programmes. “For example our virtual reality-based learning modules on autism and learning disabilities help our people supervisors and others experience the world of a person with learning disabilities and thereby be more compassionate towards their needs” says Sanjay Dawar managing director global strategy and consulting and PwD sponsor Accenture in India.

Optical and digital tech firm STL which has 10 PwDs on its rolls has translators present during interviews and has made charts and manuals available in Braille. “We invested in ASL (American Sign Language) classes for management and employees and plan on implementing changes like Braille incorporation adjusted card reader heights and creating appropriate ramps” says Anjali Byce CHRO STL.

K Raheja Corp has Braille-equipped and voice-enabled lifts facial recognition systems ramps and specially designed washrooms. The real estate company has 7 PwDs as part of its workforce with 16 more hired by its outsourcing partners. “We have observed that employees with disabilities deliver great quality of work have lower attrition rates and positively impact both our customers and internal employees” says CHRO Urvi Aradhya.

Hero MotoCorp has also fitted its manufacturing locations and corporate offices with ramps elevators and specially-designed washrooms. The country’s largest two-wheeler manufacturer recruits PwD for plant operations marketing research and development administration security and facilities among other roles.

At HCLTech the PwD headcount increased by 9 per cent in 2022-23. Its employee-led resource group promotes awareness equality and suggests policies and programmes to support inclusion and growth and address disability related topics.

Schneider Electric which employs 41 PwDs has an equal employment opportunity policy that covers both visible and invisible disabilities including chronic illnesses.

“Saksham our disability inclusion programme was launched in 2022 with intervention focussed on PwD covering aspects of sensitisation infrastructure digital accessibility and hiring” says Binu Philip CHRO Greater India zone Schneider Electric. The digital automation and energy management company says it has made its workplaces policies and processes — including those used in recruitment — accessible for all.

Delivery firm FedEx started by hiring 15 PwDs as interns during the first year of its equal employment opportunity initiative. It has now included those with speech and hearing impairments to its team. “Special measures such as sign language signage flashers on the shop floor wheelchair access and emergency whistles” have been introduced says Kami Viswanathan president Middle East Indian subcontinent and Africa FedEx.

Home appliances company Singer India has helped Kavita Bisht an acid attack survivor open a sewing skill centre in Ramnagar Uttarakhand. “The sewing skill centre provides opportunities to students including some who are physically challenged” says Rakesh Khanna managing director and vice-chairman Singer India.

Despite the progress Sigal Atzmon chief executive officer and founder of medical management firm Medix Global says many existing employee health insurance plans lack crucial services like specialised therapies and assistive devices.

Corporate houses should keep this in mind while choosing a healthcare policy Atzmon adds.

(Photo by Ian Hitchcock/Getty Images)

The most experienced coach in the game has put his hand up to lead New Zealand’s Test team with Wayne Bennett declaring: “the door is certainly open for me.”

The Kiwis are on the hunt for a new coach after parting ways with Michael Maguire who has since signed a three-year deal with the New South Wales Blues.

While Nathan Cayless and Stacey Jones are said to be leading the race for the role Bennett told News Corp that he is “open” to the job if NZRL would have him.

“I’m not retired yet so if the Kiwis are interested I’m certainly open to it” the 73-year-old told News Corp.

“I’ve got a history with New Zealand. I was involved with the All Golds team (in 2007) that was a great experience we had a tour of England and I was coach of the team.

“I’ve also worked with Steve Kearney (former Kiwis coach) when he was coaching the Kiwis and they won the World Cup in 2008 with Steve in charge.

“I have great affection for the Kiwis I coach several of their guys at the Dolphins in the (Jesse and Kenny) Bromwich boys and Jamayne Isaako.

“The door is certainly open for me. If it’s an option for the New Zealand Rugby League they know where to find me.”

Bennett is regarded was one of the best coaches the game has seen and has experience at an international level having previously led Australia and England during his 36-year career.

He is contracted to the Dolphins for one more season. He’ll then hand over the reins to Kristian Woolf.

“I have a great regard for international rugby league” Bennett said.

“I’ve always given back to that arena. The reason I was part of the 2008 World Cup with New Zealand (as an assistant)... the media were bagging the international game and saying it was just a walkover for Australia.

“That’s why I got involved. I didn’t want to stand there and watch international league die I thought let’s give this a shot and it was a great tournament for the Kiwis.

“With the Samoans and Tongans on the rise there’s a lot more interest there’s a lot more to be done so the international game is heading in the right direction now.

“I don’t know what the end of the year (2024) holds for me but I’ll be finishing up as head coach of the Dolphins so I’ll be unemployed and looking at all my options.”

NZRL is not in a rush given the Kiwis don’t play again until October but CEO Greg Peters said the governing body would “like to see something settled early next year.”

Peters said NZRL would “love to have a Kiwi coach” but the “priority is to have the best coach.”"

While the writing has been on the wall for some time the closure is a blow for those who view the iPad as the savior of the traditional publishing industry.

The Daily: First iPad newspaper shuts down

The iPad’s bump in screen size compared to the iPhone didn’t just mean a larger display to play mobile games. To those in publishing it meant the perfect digital replacement for dying print media — particularly when you factored in Apple’s successful App Store business model.

The Daily went full tilt with this idea. Although dreamed up by an old-school publisher News Corp it was an all-digital newspaper with stories available only on iPad. (It later added support for both the Galaxy Tab and Facebook.)

Rupert Murdoch gave The Daily a weekly budget of $500000. Subscriptions cost 99 cents per week with News Corp receiving 70 cents — plus any advertising revenue the company could generate. Due to News Corp’s size and clout it negotiated Apple’s first recurring payment system for subscriptions.

News Corp launched the service in February 2011 and counted Apple CEO Steve Jobs among its fans and prominent cheerleaders.

Unfortunately it didn’t take long before problems began to emerge. Although it garnered more than 100000 paying subscribers in its first year The Daily lost $30 million. Tidbits’ Adam C. Engs calculated that the paper would need roughly 715000 paid subscribers just to break even.

The Daily suffers major flaws

As with similar attempts to offer news behind paywalls The Daily suffered because it failed to offer content sufficiently different from free outlets.

It also faced a problem with sharing stories since they appeared only in the app. That made it hard for organic growth to happen. On top of this some editions of the digital newspaper ballooned up to 1GB in size and took many users 10 or 15 minutes to download.

Ultimately News Corp decided it wasn’t in it for the long run. In July 2012 it cut 30% of The Daily’s staff. This proved nothing more than a stopgap measure though.

When The Daily closed founding Editor-in-Chief Jesse Angelo moved over to become publisher of News Corp tabloid the New York Post. Some Daily staffers and assorted “technology and other assets” got folded into the Post as well.

“From its launch The Daily was a bold experiment in digital publishing and an amazing vehicle for innovation” Murdoch said in a statement announcing the shutdown. “Unfortunately our experience was that we could not find a large enough audience quickly enough to convince us the business model was sustainable in the long-term. Therefore we will take the very best of what we have learned at The Daily and apply it to all our properties.”

Today The Daily looks like it was ahead of its time. Apple News+ offers a variety of magazines and newspapers for a monthly subscription within a pleasant walled garden.

General insurer HDFC Ergo meanwhile is seeing the fruits of its hiring programme Project Purple. Its PwD headcount has jumped threefold from last year and their number as a percentage of the workforce has also doubled year-on-year the company said. “Through assistive technology such as text-to-speech software voice assistants videoconferencing tools and screen readers we have been able to ensure ease of work for all” says Sudakshina Bhattacharya president and CHRO HDFC Ergo General Insurance. The company holds sensitisation sessions for its workforce and all PwDs meet monthly with a “project champion” to discuss ways to make the workplace more inclusive and accessible.

Employees with disabilities are also rising up the ladder and companies are making sure to equip them with the right skills and tools.

Marico which currently has members with disabilities across mid to senior levels in sales manufacturing and corporate functions has introduced a programme to strengthen their integration. “This initiative is geared towards creating a consistent talent pipeline nurturing individuals with disabilities internally and preparing them for managerial roles within key business units across our organisation” says Amit Prakash CHRO Marico.

Vedanta which has 40 PwDs among its employees contractors and business partners plans to raise the number to 100. “We are looking to reach out to institutes who focus on PwDs and build a ready talent pipeline for hiring them at Vedanta” says CHRO Madhu Srivastava. The multinational mining company has also engaged external experts and non-governmental organisations that have studied its sites and discussed with the leadership team “mapping roles for PwDs depending on their abilities and nature of job” Srivastava adds.

One consistent theme is that companies are reaching out to their entire workforce with inclusivity initiatives and trying diverse ways to boost accessibility.

Natwest India for instance provides support for diagnosis workplace adjustments assistive tech (such as computer devices that support cognitive disabilities) and coaching for neurodiverse colleagues through specialist qualified partners. The tally of employees with disabilities grew 26 per cent this year at the retail and commercial lender and about 10 per cent of the company’s employees with disabilities are in leadership roles.

“We have colleagues in banking operations across roles like customer service operations delivery and technology roles like software engineers testing analysts and quality automation” says Sheetal Bathija head NatWest India hub.

Additionally over 70 per cent of its India staffers have completed an online module on awareness around disability and recognising and managing unconscious biases. Two batches of over 30 employees have also been trained in sign language.

Business software company Intuit meanwhile is changing its hiring procedures particularly the engineering interviews for neurodivergent individuals who can now share their preferences for coding communication and interview formats. The firm also has an allyship training programme for able-bodied workforce. “We are holding office-hour sessions to provide individuals from the PwD community a confidential platform to discuss concerns with HR professionals or their managers” says Devesh Amin global head of infrastructure and APAC IT Intuit India.

To eliminate unconscious bias professional services firm Accenture holds training sessions for its recruitment teams managers and team members of PwD on disability etiquette and holds experiential learning sessions and assistive technology training programmes. “For example our virtual reality-based learning modules on autism and learning disabilities help our people supervisors and others experience the world of a person with learning disabilities and thereby be more compassionate towards their needs” says Sanjay Dawar managing director global strategy and consulting and PwD sponsor Accenture in India.

Optical and digital tech firm STL which has 10 PwDs on its rolls has translators present during interviews and has made charts and manuals available in Braille. “We invested in ASL (American Sign Language) classes for management and employees and plan on implementing changes like Braille incorporation adjusted card reader heights and creating appropriate ramps” says Anjali Byce CHRO STL.

K Raheja Corp has Braille-equipped and voice-enabled lifts facial recognition systems ramps and specially designed washrooms. The real estate company has 7 PwDs as part of its workforce with 16 more hired by its outsourcing partners. “We have observed that employees with disabilities deliver great quality of work have lower attrition rates and positively impact both our customers and internal employees” says CHRO Urvi Aradhya.

Hero MotoCorp has also fitted its manufacturing locations and corporate offices with ramps elevators and specially-designed washrooms. The country’s largest two-wheeler manufacturer recruits PwD for plant operations marketing research and development administration security and facilities among other roles.

At HCLTech the PwD headcount increased by 9 per cent in 2022-23. Its employee-led resource group promotes awareness equality and suggests policies and programmes to support inclusion and growth and address disability related topics.

Schneider Electric which employs 41 PwDs has an equal employment opportunity policy that covers both visible and invisible disabilities including chronic illnesses.

“Saksham our disability inclusion programme was launched in 2022 with intervention focussed on PwD covering aspects of sensitisation infrastructure digital accessibility and hiring” says Binu Philip CHRO Greater India zone Schneider Electric. The digital automation and energy management company says it has made its workplaces policies and processes — including those used in recruitment — accessible for all.

Delivery firm FedEx started by hiring 15 PwDs as interns during the first year of its equal employment opportunity initiative. It has now included those with speech and hearing impairments to its team. “Special measures such as sign language signage flashers on the shop floor wheelchair access and emergency whistles” have been introduced says Kami Viswanathan president Middle East Indian subcontinent and Africa FedEx.

Home appliances company Singer India has helped Kavita Bisht an acid attack survivor open a sewing skill centre in Ramnagar Uttarakhand. “The sewing skill centre provides opportunities to students including some who are physically challenged” says Rakesh Khanna managing director and vice-chairman Singer India.

Despite the progress Sigal Atzmon chief executive officer and founder of medical management firm Medix Global says many existing employee health insurance plans lack crucial services like specialised therapies and assistive devices.

Corporate houses should keep this in mind while choosing a healthcare policy Atzmon adds.

The most experienced coach in the game has put his hand up to lead New Zealand’s Test team with Wayne Bennett declaring: “the door is certainly open for me.”

The Kiwis are on the hunt for a new coach after parting ways with Michael Maguire who has since signed a three-year deal with the New South Wales Blues.

While Nathan Cayless and Stacey Jones are said to be leading the race for the role Bennett told News Corp that he is “open” to the job if NZRL would have him.

“I’m not retired yet so if the Kiwis are interested I’m certainly open to it” the 73-year-old told News Corp.

“I’ve got a history with New Zealand. I was involved with the All Golds team (in 2007) that was a great experience we had a tour of England and I was coach of the team.

“I’ve also worked with Steve Kearney (former Kiwis coach) when he was coaching the Kiwis and they won the World Cup in 2008 with Steve in charge.

“I have great affection for the Kiwis I coach several of their guys at the Dolphins in the (Jesse and Kenny) Bromwich boys and Jamayne Isaako.

“The door is certainly open for me. If it’s an option for the New Zealand Rugby League they know where to find me.”

Bennett is regarded was one of the best coaches the game has seen and has experience at an international level having previously led Australia and England during his 36-year career.

He is contracted to the Dolphins for one more season. He’ll then hand over the reins to Kristian Woolf.

“I have a great regard for international rugby league” Bennett said.

“I’ve always given back to that arena. The reason I was part of the 2008 World Cup with New Zealand (as an assistant)... the media were bagging the international game and saying it was just a walkover for Australia.

“That’s why I got involved. I didn’t want to stand there and watch international league die I thought let’s give this a shot and it was a great tournament for the Kiwis.

“With the Samoans and Tongans on the rise there’s a lot more interest there’s a lot more to be done so the international game is heading in the right direction now.

“I don’t know what the end of the year (2024) holds for me but I’ll be finishing up as head coach of the Dolphins so I’ll be unemployed and looking at all my options.”

NZRL is not in a rush given the Kiwis don’t play again until October but CEO Greg Peters said the governing body would “like to see something settled early next year.”

Peters said NZRL would “love to have a Kiwi coach” but the “priority is to have the best coach.”"
NEE,NextEra Energy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAzLzMtdG9wLWVuZXJneS1zdG9ja3MtdG8tYnV5LWhhbmQtb3Zlci1maXN0LXRoaXMtZGVjL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Top Energy Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist This December,"These energy stocks could produce high-powered returns in the new year.

Energy stocks have woefully underperformed this year. While the S&P 500 is up more than 19% the energy stocks in that index are down by an average of 2%.

That underperformance has many energy stocks looking like relatively compelling investment opportunities these days. Enterprise Products Partners (EPD -0.28%) Kinder Morgan (KMI 0.68%) and NextEra Energy (NEE 0.23%) stand out to a few Fool.com contributors as the top ones to buy this December. Here's why they think investors should scoop up shares this month.

If you like passive income Enterprise has you well covered

Reuben Gregg Brewer (Enterprise Products Partners): If there's one thing that gets a dividend investor's blood pumping it's a fat yield like the 7.5% yield on offer from Enterprise Products Partners. The only thing investors need to be careful about when looking at mouthwatering yields like that is whether they're sustainable. Enterprise's yield is very well covered.

For starters the North American midstream giant operates a portfolio of energy infrastructure assets that would be virtually impossible to replace or replicate. Those assets are mostly fee driven as well so the cash flows they produce are highly reliable despite the inherent volatility of oil and natural gas prices. This is why master limited partnership (MLP) Enterprise has managed to increase its distribution annually for 25 consecutive years.

But the real strength of the distribution shows up in two other ways. First Enterprise's balance sheet is investment grade-rated. In other words it's financially strong. Second its distributable cash flows cover the distribution 1.7 times over. That leaves a huge amount of room for adversity before the distribution would be at risk. And even then Enterprise could lean on its balance sheet for a little while to support the payment if it had to. There's no telling how long Enterprise's yield will be as lofty as 7.5% so investors looking for a reliable income option should probably act sooner rather than later -- before the rest of Wall Street catches on to the story.

Flexing its flexibility

Matt DiLallo (Kinder Morgan): Kinder Morgan has spent several years shoring up its balance sheet. The natural gas pipeline giant has sold assets and used excess cash flow to reduce its debt. It has cut its debt by more than $11 billion since 2015 reducing its leverage ratio by 23%. It's on track to end this year with a leverage ratio of 4.0 well below its long-term target of 4.5.

That has given the company lots of financial flexibility. It recently found an opportunity to put some of its financial capacity to work. It agreed to buy STX Midstream from NextEra Energy Partners in a $1.8 billion deal. Kinder Morgan capitalized on the opportunity to buy a high-quality natural gas pipeline business from NextEra Energy Partners which needs cash to redeem some maturing financing. It's getting a good deal on a highly strategic asset.

The company expects STX Midstream to be accretive to its cash flow per share. Meanwhile it's only using a fraction of its financial capacity since the acquisition will increase its leverage ratio by 0.1 times in the near term. So it still has ample financial flexibility to make additional deals.

Kinder Morgan should also benefit from a growing slate of high-return expansion projects. It ended the third quarter with $3.8 billion of expansions under construction that should come online over the next few years. They'll supply the company with incremental income as they enter service.

Those two growth drivers should increase the company's cash flow. That will give it more money to pay dividends. Kinder Morgan has given its investors a raise for six straight years and currently offers a 6.4%-yielding payout. That combination of income and growth puts Kinder Morgan in a solid position to produce attractive total returns in 2024 and beyond.

Time to get greedy

Neha Chamaria (NextEra Energy): After plunging dramatically toward the end of September shares of NextEra Energy have regained some ground in recent weeks. I expect the stock to maintain its momentum and believe it's a solid buy this month. That's because NextEra Energy has its growth plans in place and some of the fears about the company appear unwarranted.

NextEra Energy stock slumped after its majority-owned limited partnership company NextEra Energy Partners slashed its dividend growth goal through 2026 in the wake of higher interest rates that made funding for growth difficult. Investors feared two things: NextEra Energy could be next in line to cut its growth forecast and lower income in the form of dividends from the limited partnership could hit its bottom line.

During its most recent earnings release though NextEra Energy said it was confident of growing its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 6% to 8% through 2026 off its 2024 estimate and expects to increase its dividend annually by around 10% at least through 2024. Management even stated it would be ""disappointed"" if the company didn't grow at the higher end of its range through 2026. NextEra Energy expects its planned investments in its utility Florida Power & Light (FPL) and renewable energy to drive growth. While FPL expects to invest up to $34 billion between 2022 and 2025 NextEra Energy's clean energy arm already has a humongous backlog of over 21 gigawatts.

For a company that's still growing its cash flows and dividends steadily and prioritizes a healthy balance sheet NextEra Energy looks like the kind of company that should not only be able to navigate challenging times but also reward shareholders along the way. With the utility stock now languishing at three-year lows and yielding 3.2% it makes for a solid long-term buy now.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAzLzUtdG9wLXN0b2Nrcy1mb3ItZGVjZW1iZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 Top Stocks for December,"This basket of growth value and income offers a little something for everyone.

2023 has nearly come and gone. But before turning your calendar to the new year it's worth considering top stocks that could be great buying opportunities.

The end of the year is the perfect time to reflect on your financial goals see where your portfolio has been and where you want it to go and align your risk tolerance with your investments.

NextEra Energy (NEE 0.23%) Brookfield Renewable (BEP -0.71%) (BEPC 0.29%) Garmin (GRMN 0.29%) Confluent (CFLT 1.14%) and Chevron (CVX -0.38%) are five completely different but worthy stocks that may help you reach your goals. Here's why each stock is worth buying in December.

This top dividend growth stock is now cheap

Neha Chamaria (NextEra Energy): With the utility sector taking a hit in the wake of higher interest rates shares of the largest electric utility in the U.S. NextEra Energy have slumped to levels last seen in 2020. The steep fall has driven NextEra Energy's dividend yield north of 3%. The stock now trades substantially below five-year averages for nearly every important valuation metric including price-to-earnings price-to-cash flow and price-to-book ratio. I believe it's a compelling opportunity to buy the stock given NextEra Energy's foothold in the industry growth plans and strong financials.

At its recent earnings conference call NextEra Energy expressed confidence in its ability to grow in the years to come driven by its two electric utility and renewable energy businesses. Florida Power & Light is the U.S.'s largest utility and expects to invest $32 billion to $34 billion in infrastructure including solar between 2022 and 2025.

Meanwhile NextEra Energy believes its clean energy arm Energy Resources is just getting started. Energy Resources is already the world's leading producer of energy from wind and solar with nearly 34 gigawatts (GW) in operation and more than 21 GW in backlog.

Driven by its investments in utility and renewable energy NextEra Energy is confident of growing its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) by 6% to 8% annually through 2026. It also expects to increase its dividend by 10% through next year at least for now.

Some investors fear NextEra Energy will cut down its dividend growth pace after a similar recent move by its limited partnership NextEra Energy Partners (NEP 3.78%). I still believe a double-digit dividend raise in 2024 is feasible. NextEra Energy's cash flows are growing steadily and it doesn't expect any effect on its adjusted EPS in 2023 and 2024 if interest rates rise by another 50 basis points. The company's balance sheet is in good shape and I think this alone could play a huge role in helping NextEra Energy navigate any storm.

Too great an opportunity to ignore

Keith Speights (Brookfield Renewable): It hasn't been a fantastic year for Brookfield Renewable. Shares of the renewable energy provider are in negative territory with 2023 winding down even as the major market indexes have delivered solid gains. However I think that Brookfield Renewable presents too great an opportunity for investors to ignore.

The company expects to generate average annual total returns of between 12% and 15% over the long term. At the low end of that range an investment will roughly double every six years. I suspect that most investors would be quite happy with that kind of performance.

Of course setting a target is different than actually achieving it. But I'm confident that Brookfield Renewable will be able to do what it says it will do. In my view the company probably has the clearest path to delivering double-digit total returns compared to any other on the market.

It's abundantly evident that the demand for renewable energy sources -- especially onshore wind and solar -- will continue to increase significantly. There's simply no way that countries and major corporations around the world will be able to reach their carbon reduction goals without a lot more renewable energy.

Brookfield Renewable is in a great position to help meet this rising demand. Its operational capacity currently totals around 31.5 gigawatts. The company's development pipeline is more than 4.5 times that capacity. CEO Connor Teskey noted in Brookfield Renewable's third-quarter earnings conference call that the company continues to see plenty of attractive acquisition opportunities.

I especially like Brookfield Renewable's distribution yield of over 5%. The company plans to increase its distribution by 5% to 9% per year. With this strong distribution and exceptional growth prospects this stock looks like a no-brainer to buy in December.

Navigate toward higher returns

Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Garmin): There's a lot to love about Garmin stock right now. Sure the tech hardware giant went through a rough sales period following the pandemic. Revenue declined 6% last year following a 19% surge in 2021. That marked the first time in seven years that Garmin hasn't steadily boosted its sales.

The tech company is thankfully returning to its more usual and impressive expansion pace right now. Sales were up 12% last quarter and operating profit landed at a robust 21% of sales. Garmin's management team took the opportunity to raise their 2023 outlook saying in early November that sales should rise by about 5% this year to $5.2 billion.

I like Garmin for its diverse portfolio that spans consumer-focused devices like smart watches and fitness trackers but also higher-priced products like marine and aviation navigation platforms. The company has demonstrated a knack for innovating across these varied segments and the payoff has been rising sales and market-beating profitability over the years.

It's true that the stock jumped in response to the good news that investors have seen in Garmin's results this year. But there's still room to enjoy solid returns by holding shares over the long term. At below 5 times annual sales Garmin's price-to-sales valuation is still far less than the pandemic peak of close to 7 times sales. But the business looks very strong as it aims to conclude another year of sales growth and profit expansion in 2023. Toss in a modest dividend payment and Garmin should help investors find their way to market-thumping returns.

Confluent: The unsung hero of secure data messaging

Anders Bylund (Confluent): When I talk about streaming services the conversation usually centers on media streaming experts such as Netflix (NFLX 0.26%). These innovators turned the entertainment world upside down over the last decade or so and digital streaming is the default method of video and music delivery for many people in 2023.

Confluent runs a streaming service too but a very different one.The Confluent Kafka suite is a system that carries any kind of data from a publishing hub to any number of delivery endpoints. The actual stream can be anything including plain text digital video or raw binary data. Businesses use it to manage everything from log files and real-time sensor readings to remote backups and ultra-secure data transfers.

This reliable connectivity plays a central role in the Internet of Things and Web3 revolutions shepherding the right data to the right destination -- millions or even billions of times per second. For classical Unix nerds like myself you can think of Kafka as a modernized version of MQ (formerly MQSeries).

This stock is a fairly fresh face entering the public market as recently as 2021. However the company has been around since 2014 when three original inventors of the open-source Apache Kafka system wanted to commercialize their powerful messaging solution. A decade later Confluent provides enterprise-ready features in addition to the basic Apache Kafka solution selling software subscriptions and technical support services.

The business is absolutely humming as you'd expect from a cornerstone of several next-generation technology trends. Revenues rose 32% year over year in the recently reported third quarter of 2023. The quarter was profitable on an adjusted basis exceeding Wall Street's consensus estimates across the board. That's business as usual apart from the newfound profitability. Confluent has a firm history of beating expectations and delivering robust growth.

And don't forget about the media-streaming giants -- as it turns out Netflix relies on Kafka to manage its content production spending real-time viewing data and financial forecasting. Yes that's a diverse grab bag of data streams highlighting just how flexible Kafka is. This little technology is going places.

Yet that surprising Q3 report triggered another sharp sell-off. Confluent's stock price plunged 42% lower the next day due to modest guidance for the next reporting period. Fourth-quarter sales were aimed at a 21% year-over-year increase along with continued bottom-line profits. But the top-line reading was below the average analyst projection at the time and that was enough to inspire that dreadful price cut.

Well the lower share price is dreadful only if you own Confluent already and were planning to sell the stock someday soon. Otherwise I see a fantastic buying opportunity here. The original founders still run the company preserving Confluent's spirit of innovation and personal C-suite commitment to the company's success. This is a high-powered growth story addressing several important secular trends at once with tremendous business growth to boot.

Take advantage of the sell-off in Chevron

Daniel Foelber (Chevron): Chevron more than doubled between the beginning of 2021 and the end of 2022. But this year hasn't been as kind to the energy giant. Chevron is down 20% year to date and is hovering around a 52-week low.

The sell-off makes sense to some degree considering the stock's epic run-up leading into this year and the fact that oil prices have cooled off. But there's reason to believe Chevron is undervalued now.

Big tech companies use their gobs of free cash flow to buy back stock and invest in growth which allows them to take market share regardless of the market cycle. Chevron does the same thing just with a degree of caution that's valued in the highly cyclical oil and gas industry.

For example Chevron continued to pay and raise its dividend even during the brutal oil and gas downturn of 2020 while also making some small but brilliant acquisitions in hindsight when so much of the industry was barely getting by.

Today Chevron has been able to flex its high profits and financial muscle to buy back a boatload of stock and make its largest acquisition in over 20 years.

Chevron has geographic exposure and diversification throughout the oil and gas value chain. It also has an incredibly strong balance sheet that was successfully stress-tested in 2020. It has paid and raised its dividend for 36 consecutive years and is probably going to announce another dividend raise in January. For now the forward yield is 4.2%.

Finally Chevron stock is still cheap sporting a price-to-earnings ratio of just 10.7.

Add it all up and there's a lot to like about Chevron stock this December.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wYi5vcmcvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIzLzEyLzAzL29yZWdvbi1ydXJhbC1zb2xhci1wb3dlci1lbmVyZ3kv0gFWaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cub3BiLm9yZy9hcnRpY2xlLzIwMjMvMTIvMDMvb3JlZ29uLXJ1cmFsLXNvbGFyLXBvd2VyLWVuZXJneS8_b3V0cHV0VHlwZT1hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,USDA grows solar power in rural Oregon despite limited transmission assistance,"The solar component of the Wheatridge Renewable Energy Facility was completed in March 2022.

More farmland across the U.S. will need to host power-generating solar panels for the country to decarbonize the electric grid and meet targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions according to the U.S. Departments of Energy and Agriculture.

But that’s not the sell that officials at the USDA’s Rural Development office use to entice Oregon farmers and rural business owners to get onboard.

“We estimate that our customers are saving between 40% and 100% on their electricity bills” said Margaret Hoffman Oregon director for the rural development office.

Those customers are farmers and small business owners across the state who’ve applied for historic federal funding to put solar panels on their land and businesses through the Rural Energy for America Program. It’s been around since 2008 but received a record $1 billion in funding as part of the Inflation Reduction Act passed by Congress in 2022. It is now according to Hoffmann the single largest investment in rural electrification since the 1930s and farmers and business owners are eager to jump on it.

“We’ve seen a huge uptick of interest in the program” Hoffman said.

In the last year the office has invested more than $4 million in 38 solar projects in rural Oregon. But challenges with a lack of transmission for the electricity and a lack of local technical assistance – including help applying for grants to offset the cost of solar installations – remain. Hoffman who previously served as energy policy advisor for former Oregon Govs. John Kitzhaber and Kate Brown said it’s something she’s trying to champion as demand for solar in rural Oregon grows.

Small scale

Hoffman said solar installations that provide community-level energy are the “bread and butter” of the federal rural energy program.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

Big solar installations like the state’s first proposed large-scale solar park and farm in the Willamette Valley have drawn more criticism or concern in rural communities. The Muddy Creek project in Linn County would cover 1100 acres. The Rural Energy for America program funds projects that wouldn’t require more than a few acres and is geared at smaller solar installations that can provide clean power directly to businesses and neighboring homes.

Hoffman said projects can be everything from solar panels on a production facility that cut energy costs to solar panels on a barn or in a field that can in turn help reduce the high costs of pumping water for farm irrigation.

One smaller grant recipient Trail Distilling in Oregon City got $73000 to help pay for roof-mounted solar panels that have brought its energy bills down to about $13 per month Hoffman said. A $1 million grant to fund a community solar project on city-owned industrial property in Ontario in eastern Oregon is slated to save the city more than $50000 per year in reduced energy costs.

Challenges

Critics of the proposed Muddy Creek solar installation on Willamette Valley farmland have said solar developments should happen in eastern Oregon where there is more abundant and less fertile land. But electric transmission lines from the east part of the state to the west are still underdeveloped and much of the land is owned by the federal government which makes siting for solar development difficult.

“If you look at the eastern part of the state there’s a lot of Bureau of Land Management land there’s a lot of Forest Service land and some of that land has heightened protection because it’s either sage grouse territory or there’s a threatened plant species or something like that” Hoffman said. Siting on federal lands which includes undergoing a rigorous environmental impact assessment can cost millions.

Then there’s the cost of building the grid that’s needed to transmit the electricity. New transmission lines cost about $1 million per mile to build.

“So if you have to build a project that’s 15 miles away from the nearest transmission line you just added $15 million to your costs” she said.

On top of that some large utilities charge a “wheeling fee” – essentially charging solar developers and producers a fee for using any part of the utilities’ transmission lines to transfer energy to the utilities’ customers.

These more expensive issues aside Hoffman said the greatest challenge is helping farmers and business owners ask for the federal money they need to develop solar on their own lands.

“I think that the biggest challenge that we see is that an agricultural producer and a small business owner need technical assistance in order to write the grant and get all of the materials that are required to access the federal funding together” Hoffman said. “Any investments we can be making in technical assistance increases the equitable access to our program.”

They face more challenges ahead,"New York CNN —

Clean energy stocks are out of vogue as higher interest rates and lagging efforts to combat climate change dog the sector. Those obstacles might not go away anytime soon.

The iShares Global Clean Energy exchange-traded fund which tracks the performance of sectors from renewable electricity to semiconductors to solar energy has slumped 27% this year underperforming the MSCI All-Country World index’s 15% gain. The fund is on pace for its third straight annual loss.

Plug Power shares have slipped 63% this year Enphase Energy shares have plunged 60% SolarEdge Technologies shares have declined 71% and NextEra Energy shares have slid 29%.

The Biden administration’s sweeping Inflation Reduction Act promised $750 billion in funding for health and climate projects. Since its passage last year more than 270 new clean energy projects have been announced with $132 billion in private investments according to a Bank of America report released in August.

Yet clean energy stocks haven’t recovered despite hopes that an influx of US government spending on climate solutions would help revive the sector.

The culprit behind clean energy stocks’ poor returns? Interest rates are perched at a 22-year high after the Federal Reserve began its aggressive rate hiking campaign last March driving up borrowing costs for growing companies trying to load up on capital. Supply chain snarls have further complicated matters.

Money managers say that while some clients are interested in owning shares of sustainability-driven companies those challenges make it difficult to simultaneously maximize portfolio returns.

Expectations that rates will remain elevated at least through the beginning of 2024 could keep the lid on those firms’ earnings. Clean energy names tend to trade on their future earnings potential since they’re part of a fledgling sector. But there are concerns that these stocks are pricey relative to their current balance sheets despite their steep decline this year.

“There are some really rosy assumptions being baked into the share prices” of clean energy companies said Todd Jones chief investment officer at Gratus Capital.

Jean Rosenbaum senior portfolio manager at GYL Financial Synergies says her firm has pared back its clean energy exposure in recent months on concerns about weakening corporate earnings due to elevated rates. Clean energy investments make up under 5% of her firm’s assets.

Some investors say that the slow global transition to clean energy has also dampened their enthusiasm.

Eight years have passed since the Paris Agreement was approved to slow Earth’s warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius or more ideally to 1.5 degrees. Since then in part because of the lack of specific action laid out in the plan the more than 190 countries part of that agreement have made little headway in achieving those goals.

Andrew Poreda vice president at Sage Advisory says that higher rates have also hurt consumers seeking a transition to using clean energy. Switching to a residential solar system for example requires thousands of dollars that might be sought in a loan now possibly prohibitive due to high borrowing costs he says.

That’s not to say investors are giving up entirely on sustainability investing.

Peter Krull director of sustainable investments at Earth Equity Advisors manages a portfolio that focuses on stocks in industries from alternative energy to battery technology to green transportation.

That portfolio has overall outperformed the MSCI World All Cap Index since its creation in 2012 though its taken a hit in recent years. Krull sees the current rut in clean energy stocks as a buying opportunity for investors.

Clean energy stocks also aren’t the only way investors are putting their cash to work with a sustainability mindset. Shares of Nvidia the artificial intelligence powerhouse that has soared 220% this year are part of Krull’s firm’s portfolio.

Artificial intelligence has dominated Wall Street this year powering monster gains in shares of mega-tech companies. Experts say that AI will be a key tool in accelerating climate change solutions from reducing pollution to replanting.

“A lot of people’s impression of sustainable investing is buying solar or buying wind but at the end of the day it’s more about the systems that we can improve” Krull said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndoaXRlcml2ZXJub3cuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMDMvd2hpdGUtcml2ZXItd29uZGVybGFuZC1mZXJyaXMtd2hlZWwtcmV0dXJucy1kZWMtMTYv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,White River Wonderland Ferris wheel returns Dec. 16,"The 70-foot tall Ferris wheel will return to Batesville’s White River Wonderland Dec. 16 through Dec. 23 according to the Batesville Area Chamber of Commerce.

Niwot's Addy Ritzenhein stormed away to win the Nike Cross National title.

The Southwest came saw and conquered the 2023 Mud Fest that was Nike Cross Nationals on Saturday.

Not only was there mud to deal with but there was a puddle six-inches deep -- spanning nearly 20-meters -- that athletes had to high-step through ... twice.

Despite the classic Pacific Northwest conditions one state in particular dominated the competition in the girls race.

It was Colorado.

The much anticipated battle between U.S. No. 1 Niwot and U.S. No. 2 Air Academy lived up to the hype and there was a stunner at third but we'll come back to that.

Two weeks ago Niwot took down Air Academy by 12-points at the NXR Southwest Regional. This week the national title came down to 11 points only with a different outcome. It was Air Academy soaring over Niwot.

Air Academy made history for the Centennial State capturing Colorado's first team title tallying 61 points to Niwot's 72.

A year ago the Kadets finished seventh at NXN.

Bethany Michalak led Air Academy with a runner-up finish in 17:16.

Her squad had the edge through three runners while Niwot was a stride ahead at No. 4 and No. 5.

Air Academy's win capped one of the best seasons of any Colorado squad. Just over a month ago the girls dropped the No. 1 performance ever at the Colorado State Cross Country Championships.

But Niwot was able to flip the script at NXR Southwest leading Colorado and as three Colorado teams (including Mountain Vista) went 1-2-3 there.

Niwot continued its streak of impressive finishes at NXN finishing second.

The Cougars have finished in the top-five in four out of the past four times at NXN. The stunner of the day however had to be Mountain Vista which finished third with 163 points.

Mountain Vista finished third at NXR Southwest and had to wait a week to get the call for an At-Large berth. Clearly the girls made the most of the opportunity.

Prior to Saturday morning Mountain Vista was ranked No. 12.

By lunchtime the girls were third at nationals and arguably now can be considered the third-best squad in the country.

Leading the squad was Peyton Adams who finished 31st overall.

Mountain Vista's result was another historic moment in NXN history -- one state has never swept the top-three spots.

Oh but we're not done.

Colorado also won the individual race as well.

Addison (Addy) Ritzenhein pumped her arms up the double-hill and into the final straightaway as the Niwot sophomore captured her first national title running 17:10 on Saturday.

The Niwot sophomore covered her face in disbelief as her father screamed in joy from the sidelines -- the 2023 Nike Cross National Champion.

As mentioned plenty of times before Ritzenhein is the daughter of former 5000 American Record holder and Olympian Dathan Ritzenhein.

""Ritz"" as he is known was a two-time Footlocker National Champion in 1999 and 2000. The two embraced as they join a short-list of father-daughter national champions.

Addy's performance extended the legacy and in essence solidified her own name.

The Niwot sophomore was patient over the muddy hills and overtook pre-race favorite Elizabeth Leachman in the final mile. Leachman set a hot early pace and finished 15th. While Air Academy and Niwot went 1-2 in the team race the result was flipped in the individual race as Ritzenhein led Niwot with her first-place finish while Air Academy's Michalak was six seconds back in second. Michalak's run was one place up from last year's third-place finish while Ritzenhein went from 18th last year to first this year.

Third-through-seventh was a wild kick to the finish separated by two seconds with Crescent Valley's Emily Wisniewski taking the final podium spot finishing third in 17:37.4.

Colorado's third-runner to cross the line was Isabel Allori who finished fourth in 17:37.4. Coming in fifth was Rachel Forsyth from Ann Arbor Pioneer.

While there were plenty of scripts flipped in the girls competition perhaps it was the boys race -- which was first on the course -- that hinted at much more.

U.S. No. 1 American Fork and U.S. No. 2 Herriman battled into the final mile but this time it was pre-race favorite American Fork who was chasing.

These two squads have raced several times this season and over the fall each team had their hand in the winner's circle. But Saturday Herriman won the most important meet of the season.

The Utah program raced to perfection in Portland tallying 83 points to claim the NXN title. American Fork took second with 101 points while Southlake Carroll (TX) was third with 138 points. The result gave Utah a 1-2 finish.





Individually it was upset city as JoJo Jourdon kicked over the final double-hill to claim the national title in 15:16.

Jourdan finished second at NXR-Southwest to American's Fork's Daniel Simmons who finished 13th at NXN.

A year ago Jourdan did not compete at NXR-Southwest -- he finished third at Garmin RunningLane Cross Country Championships.

While Jourdan's kick went unmatched the race for second went down to the line.

Cameron Todd and Nathan Neil were separated by one-tenth-of-a-second with Todd taking second in 15:18.5 to Neil's 15:18.6.

The mid-2010s was the height of Nike Basketball’s collective holiday series spearheading a synonymous Christmas theme across each of their signature solutions. While last season’s installment centered around a Museum aesthetic that preserved the greatness of their athletes this year the Beaverton brand’s Greater Than series of on-court footwear will serve as the annual thematic cohort.

Utilizing the Zoom Cut 2 GT Jump 2 and the GT Hustle 2 the upcoming collection spreads a litany of Christmas-time decorations across each model like the Nike branded To and From gifting tassels. Following a metallic candy cane treatment the GT Cut 2 sees its heel coated in a shimmering “Silver Metallic” that’s accented by a cream-white midsole and green and red complements. In a similar vein the GT Hustle 2 is anchored by the season’s synonymous two-toned treatment as a vibrant crimson animates the entirety of the upper with seldom green and silver accents paired with cursive Nike embroidery at the heel that rings in the yuletide cheer.

Standing in stark opposition the GT Jump 2 mirrors the aesthetic of a chilling winter blizzard with a light grey upper and a collection of icy blue contrasts. While each pair explores a slightly different design the upcoming collection sees a few similarities between mismatched green and red laces and intricate snowflake detailing that ascertains each effort.

While a release date hasn’t been confirmed expect the Nike Greater Than Christmas pack to debut in the next few weeks. In the meantime enjoy a detailed look at each pair below.

Plus more Web3 drops,"One month it's sneakers; the next it’s T-shirts that are receiving a Web3-connected upgrade. That's the case for Nike's digital community platform Dot Swoosh which finally dropped its long-awaited ""Tinaj"" tee collection this week. The second product to arrive from the sportswear label's Web3 venture was another sell-out success but critiques are already rolling in about Nike's virtual strategy.

In other news this week Web3-native beauty label Kiki World has opened up its polls once again inviting its community to vote for their favorite nail color. The brand recently launched an innovative NFC-chipped press-on nails series that when scanned shares wearers' LinkedIn Instagram and email information. As they say let your nails do the talking (or in this case the networking).

What happened

Following the success of its debut ""OF1"" IRL sneaker drop in October Nike was back this month with its ""Tinaj"" T-shirt collection release on November 29.

Exclusive to Dot Swoosh members the shirt features the Dot Swoosh logo as well as the slogan ""This Is Not A JPEG"" — a satirical response to NFT skeptics who often refer to tokens as nothing more than JPEGs. The collection sold out in 30 minutes via the SNKRS app.

Why it matters

While Nike's sell-out success reaffirmed the growing demand for Web3-enabled apparel not everyone was a happy customer.

Dot Swoosh members took to social hub X (formerly Twitter) to decry that Nike had failed to notify its community about the drop's new launch date after it was originally postponed. Others criticized the lack of supply Nike had produced as well as bugs on the platform that prevented them from copping the T-shirt in time. ""This is a disappointment. Hold back by one week to make it a shock drop and not allow exclusive access to Tinaj holders to buy"" one X user wrote.

What happened

Kiki World the revolutionary new player joining the beauty brand scene is inviting its community to vote again on its next product release dubbed ""Chipped."" Members will be able to choose their favorite color for the label's upcoming press-on nail launch until December 31 celebrating its recent drop of NFC-connected press-ons.

Wearers can invite their social circle to scan their nails to access information such as their LinkedIn account Instagram and email disrupting the way we network and exchange contacts.

Why it matters

A disruptor through and through Kiki World is transforming the beauty ecosystem one crowdsourced project at a time. Chipped for example is turning business cards into business claws an activation that has caused a buzz across the industry.

The startup's commitment to identifying its consumers as co-creators ushers in a new playbook for beauty brands — one that competitors will undoubtedly be taking a leaf out of soon.

What happened

London-based fashion label and LVMH Prize 2023 shortlister Paolina Russo is leaping into Roblox to outfit in-game avatars in its trademark knitwear pieces.

In partnership with digital fashion platform Sknups three key looks from the upcoming brand's fall 2023 collection have been digitized into in-game virtual versions. The project coincides with a new installation from the brand at Dover Street Market London which launched on November 30.

Why it matters

Roblox has emerged as a thriving destination for rising creators to experiment with aesthetics and reach wider audiences. For lesser-known cult labels like Paolina Russo the activation marks a milestone in the brand's rise to prominence across the fashion industry.

Gaming platforms are a hotspot for independent brands to gain cultural recognition.

Ahead of release later this month the Swoosh has just shared its official visual breakdown of both the all-white and all-black looks while also clarifying that its launch period begins on December 15 via the SNKRS app at a price of $155 USD each. For more info about the project be sure to review our previous coverage below.

Update: Matthew M Williams has shared a set of images of the imminent 1017 ALYX 9SM x Nike Air Force 1 Low. After the design blueprint debuted at the end of last week Williams took to Instagram to reveal the black and white colorways of the minimalistic sneaker. The design of the sneakers strongly resembles that indicated in the teased design plans; the deubré sees a customized ALYX x Nike co-branded design and subtle ALYX logos are etched and engraved throughout. Take a closer look at the joints – expected to release before the end of the year – in the carousel below and stay tuned for more updates as they surface.

Original Story: Matthew Williams the creative director and co-founder of 1017 ALYX 9SM as well as the creative director of Givenchy has revealed a first look at an upcoming collaboration with Nike using the Air Force 1 Low silhouette for the basis of the design.

The pair follows the Air Force 1 High which was first revealed in 2018 and released in 2020 with several iterations released since. In comparison to the High which featured the brand’s iconic roller coaster buckle the Air Force 1 Low feels quite understated as in its current form it features no hardware outside of a co-branded deubré.

Other co-branding elements likely to be printed etched or stitched appear at the lower portion of the heel on the lateral side of the shoe at the tongue label and on the insoles. With the drawings in black and white there is very little detail provided in terms of texture or material that will be used and at first glance the difference between the ALYX pair and Nike’s inline AF1 are minimal.

Williams’ post did however mention that the 1017 ALYX 9SM x Nike Air Force 1 Low will be “coming soon” which will hopefully mean more details will be shared soon as well.

(AP) — The head of the union that represents track maintenance workers says Union Pacific is jeopardizing safety by delaying nearly 1200 planned projects until next year and laying off more than 1000 workers but the railroad says the seasonal move shouldn’t be alarming.

The president of the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employes Division union has been sending letters to regulators for more than a month raising concerns about the layoffs but the the Surface Transportation Board hasn’t intervened.

“Chaos and disruption with Union Pacific’s Maintenance of Way forces can only lead to one outcome — deferred maintenance and catastrophic outcomes” Tony Cardwell who leads the union said in his letters. “These furloughs will affect the safety of Union Pacific operations and pose serious safety risks for the general public and the communities surrounding Union Pacific’s infrastructure.”

Union Pacific said the decision to delay these projects is a reflection of the fact that the railroad went over budget after dealing with several unexpected weather events like the tropical storm that hit California this year and last summer’s extreme heat. The railroad said it remains committed to safety and improving its track network across the western U.S.

Railroad safety has been a concern nationwide this year ever since a Norfolk Southern train derailed spilled hazardous chemicals and caught fire in eastern Ohio in February. Members of Congress proposed reforms but those have largely stalled.

Cardwell said that after these layoffs of 1350 workers UP will have only a little over 4700 track maintenance workers. Back in 2015 before a series of cuts designed to make the railroad more efficient Union Pacific employed 8791. That means each maintenance worker will now have about 11 miles (17.7 kilometers) of track to take care of on average up from 8.6 last year and 6.5 in 2016.

The union is concerned that these cuts are an indication of how tightly new CEO Jim Vena plans to manage the railroad’s expenses. Union Pacific like all the major freight railroads already made significant cuts in its workforce over the past several years as part of overhauling its operations to rely more on fewer longer trains. Last month Union Pacific announced plans to trim the ranks of its mangers across the railroad to help streamline decision making.

Union Pacific hasn’t done large year-end layoffs of maintenance workers like this in several years according to the union although these jobs were originally listed as seasonal positions.

Union Pacific spokeswoman Clarissa Beyah said the actual number of furloughs will be smaller than the union fears because many workers take other jobs with the railroad and some workers may have enough vacation time saved up to cover the period.

“Accusations that Union Pacific does not invest in its infrastructure and maintenance are untrue” Beyah said. “This year alone the railroad will spend $3.7 billion on capital investment of which a significant portion is allotted for maintenance. As part of the capital planning process we are temporarily reducing some seasonal track maintenance positions.”

The railroad said its workers have already replaced more than 3 million railroad ties and more than 400 miles of track across the railroad this year.

And even though these maintenance workers will be out of work during the holiday season Union Pacific said it continues to hire train crews in certain locations as part of its effort to improve service and make sure it can handle all the shipments companies hire the railroad to deliver. At last report Union Pacific had more than 33000 employees in October before these layoffs began.

The union has been told that maintenance workers will be called back to work sometime in January after the railroad finalizes its capital spending budget for next year but it’s not clear exactly when that will happen or how many workers will regain their jobs. Cardwell said anytime there are layoffs some jobs are always lost permanently because not everyone is rehired.

Village leaders met with local and state officials as well as the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Recovery Coordinator Jim McPherson and Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw to shift the focus from the environmental remediation to an economic recovery in the wake of the rail disaster.

“Today was to bring federal state local and community leaders together and have a conversation about getting this community back on its feet. East Palestine is going to be a story about resilience recovery and working together” Shaw said. “We’ve exited the most intensive phase of environmental remediation we’ve committed over $100 million to the community to help it recover and help it thrive and this is basically the logical next step — bringing everyone together and saying “how do we invest in the long term to help the businesses and the community thrive? It’s going to take all of us working together. That’s how we’ve gotten to this point so far and I am really encouraged by the level of coordination and cooperation and focus on the future.”

The plan is for participants of the roundtable to get back together early next year and continue the conversation with village businesses. The team is expected to deliver an executive summary in January that outlines what is needed to not only revitalize the village following the derailment but to resurrect it from the economic woes it faced long before Feb. 3. The summary was described as a roadmap for stakeholders to follow and utilize East Palestine’s strengths which were as diverse as its demographics.

Roundtable participants also included East Palestine Mayor Trent Conaway and Fire Chief Keith Drabick state Rep. Monica Robb Blasdel Norfolk Southern’s Vice President of Business Development Kathleen Smith Columbiana County Port Authority Executive Director Penny Traina Port Authority Private Sector Specialist Haeden Panezott and representatives from JobsOhio Team NEO (a Cleveland-based economic development organization meant to promote business expansion and job creation throughout Northeast Ohio) and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency. Mike Jacoby and Jeff Harris of Bricker Graydon the economic development firm hired by the village through a $500000 grant from the railroad led presentations that discussed the initial assessment of the village’s economic health and a theme of live work shop visit and recreate in East Palestine.

“Our firm Bricker Graydon was hired to do an economic development plan for the village and we started in mid-September” explained Jacoby who also serves on the East Palestine Economic Development Plan Steering Committee. “The first phase was listening and understanding what all the problems are that we are trying to address. Today we shared some initial findings and talked about some of the early steps and themes and to talk about where we go from here.”

Jacoby said shaking off the stigma left behind by the derailment is crucial for the village. To remedy that he said the village has hired WRL a Canton-based advertising firm to change the narrative.

“WRL is putting out a branded campaign to talk about the good things that are happening in East Palestine and to provide factual information about what clean-up has occurred and what the test results are and to talk about moving forward and have that be the image that is not only projected to the residents but out to the broader world as well.”

While no detailed plans were revealed at the roundtable Jacoby said the idea is to rejuvenate the downtown district using Columbiana as a blueprint. He also said the businesses already in the village need to stay new businesses need to move in and the village’s manufacturing industry needs to be fostered.

“Downtown needs to be more vibrant. You want shopping with restaurants on the first floor and offices and lofts on the second but you also want manufacturers” he said. “There are manufacturers here and we need to make sure they have what they need to grow. That may be a space where they can grow. It may be financing programs to help them grow. It may be workforce training programs to help them grow. There’s a lot of different things that can be done and it’s going to take time but you have to start with a good plan.”

Shaw said Norfolk Southern’s role in that plan is to provide the resources needed.

“I said from the beginning that Norfolk Southern would be here for the long haul and we will be here to see this community through. Norfolk Southern will continue to provide assistance its resources and its economic development arm to help East Palestine” Shaw said. “Folks here are ready to take their energy and put it toward a positive direction. There are a lot of folks in this fantastic village who are really ready to start talking about resiliency and recovery and working forward. People want to continue to live here. People want to continue to raise their families here and make their living here. There is a lot of pride among the citizens of this village and we want to help support that and cultivate that.”

NORTHWOOD – The Bowling Green Post of the Ohio State Highway Patrol is investigating a crash involving a train that occurred today just before 5:30 a.m. on Walbridge Road near Owen Road in Lake Township.

A Ford Fusion operated by Vinod Venkatesan 35 Flint Michigan was eastbound on Walbridge Road when it became stuck on the railroad tracks. The driver exited the vehicle before it was struck by a northwest bound Amtrak train.

The Amtrak train had 112 passengers and crew on board. The train consisted of six railcars and a locomotive and was traveling from Pittsburgh to Toledo.

The railroad was closed until just before 7 a.m. when Amtrak cleared the scene. No injuries were reported in the crash.

The three nations announced Dec. 2 they will host and operate the Deep Space Advanced Radar Capability (DARC) a next generation ground-based sensor funded by the U.S. Space Force and currently being developed by Northrop Grumman.

“The Deep Space Advanced Radar Capability will leverage the geography of the United States Australia and the United Kingdom to further enhance our collective space domain awareness: the ability to track identify and characterize space objects” U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy John Plumb said Dec. 2 in a news release.

Three sites to be built by 2030

DARC will provide 24/7 all-weather capabilities to track and characterize objects deep in space — in geosynchronous orbit up to 22000 miles above Earth.

The first DARC radar site to be constructed in Exmouth Western Australia is expected to be operational in 2026. All three sites are projected to be completed by 2030. They will support space defense initiatives space-traffic management and global surveillance of military and commercial satellites.

Armament-wise the Spirit can pack a punch.

On July 17 1989 the U.S. Air Force’s B-2 stealth bomber first took to the skies. Thirty-four years have gone by but the formidable airframe continues to serve as a key component of America’s long-range strike arsenal.

The platform’s manufacturer Northrop Grumman released a statement this week proudly asserting that “three decades later the iconic flying wing is more advanced than ever and in a class of its own.” The statement added that by “morphing with the times the B-2’s avionics technology stealth and armament have evolved to ensure U.S. air dominance.”

The heavy strategic bomber designed to penetrate enemy anti-aircraft defenses may be old. But the Air Force continues to pour resources into the platform to ensure it stays relevant and capable.

The Origin Story of the B-2

The concept of stealth airframes dates back to the 1970s when aircraft engineers discovered a method to avoid interceptors and missiles. The military wanted an airframe that could fly nearly undetected by deflecting or absorbing radar signals.

In the middle of the decade the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency collaborated with American aviation firms to determine the largest radar cross-section an airframe could have and still remain undetectable by enemy airframes. Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin were tapped to create stealth prototypes. Ultimately Lockheed designed the F-117 airframe and Northrop created the technology that would become the B-2 stealth bomber.

Specs and Capabilities

Capable of all-altitude attack missions with long-ranges the B-2 can fly to any point in the world within hours. Armament-wise the Spirit can pack a punch. To separate weapons bays sit in the center of the airframe. With a carrying capacity of 40000 pounds the B-2 can carry conventional weapons nuclear weapons and a host of other munitions. As detailed by Air Force Technology “Each weapons bay is equipped with a rotary launcher and two bomb-rack assemblies.

In tests the B-2 successfully released B-61 and B-83 nuclear and mk84 conventional bombs from the rotary rocket launcher and mk82 and CBU-87 conventional weapons from the bomb racks.

The B61-11 is an earth-penetrating nuclear bomb for use against deeply buried and hardened targets. The B83 is a strategic free-fall nuclear bomb.”

Over the years the B-2 Spirit has incorporated a series of upgrades. A generic weapons interface system was added as part of the Block 30 upgrade enabling the airframe to attack up to four different types of targets on one mission. Other weapons enhancements include the addition of the upgraded nuclear B-61 Mod 2 variant which allows any bomb a greater envelope of attack opportunities.

Over its three-plus decades of life so far the Spirit has seen combat in Iraq Kosovo and Afghanistan.

Today 20 B-2 Spirits remain in use with the Air Force.

This number was originally 21 but a B-2 was lost in a crash in 2008.

Although the Spirit is set to be replaced by the B-21 Raider in the early 2030s the airframe remains the most formidable bomber aircraft in the skies today.

The unpiloted cargo ship called Progress 86 docked to the station's Russian-built Poisk module under remote control by Roscosmos cosmonauts Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub who tracked its approach from inside the ISS. Kononenko took control of the cargo ship remotely using a system called TORU while the Progress 86 craft was flying around the station at a range of about 150 meters apparently due to an issue with the cargo ship's own Kurs automated rendezvous system.

""During the flyaround the Progress vehicle started drifting away from the expected attitude and was not aligned with the docking target"" NASA spokesperson Anna Schneider said during live commentary. ""The crew aboard the International Space Station has taken over manual control and recovered the expected attitude.""

Kononenko docked the Progress 86 spacecraft with the ISS at 6:18 a.m. EDT (1118 GMT) ending a two-day spaceflight that began Friday (Dec. 1) with a successful launch atop a Russian Soyuz rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The cargo ship completed 37 orbits of Earth before docking.

""Contact confirmed capture confirmed"" Kononenko radioed to Roscosmos mission control near Moscow. The Progress 86 and ISS were sailing 260 miles over the western Pacific Ocean.

Progress 86 is carrying 5600 pounds (2540 kilograms) of supplies for the seven crewmembers currently living and working on the ISS. That haul includes food equipment supplies and science experiment gear tp be used by long-duration crews during their six-month stays on the station.

Russia's Progress spacecraft are one of several different vehicles used to periodically resupply the ISS. They are disposable and are designed to burn up in Earth's atmosphere at the end of their months-long missions. SpaceX's Dragon cargo ships and Northrop Grumman's Cygnus spacecraft also resupply the station.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiO2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEyLzAyL2tldHRsZV9tdXNrX3RhbnRydW0v0gE_aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhlcmVnaXN0ZXIuY29tL0FNUC8yMDIzLzEyLzAyL2tldHRsZV9tdXNrX3RhbnRydW0v?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Elon is the bakery owner swearing in the street about Yelp critics canceling him,"Kettle By now Elon Musk should be used to high-risk maneuvers.

If you had to narrow it down to just one company that defined the stock market's performance in 2023 it would be hard to come up with a better pick than Nvidia (NVDA 0.34%). The company's graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware was at the center of this year's incredible leaps forward for artificial intelligence (AI) technologies.

It powered popular services from OpenAI including ChatGPT paved the way for Microsoft to make big plays in the space and made a wide range of other high-performance applications possible.

The demand for Nvidia's tech also powered explosive gains for the company's stock. The processing specialist's share price has skyrocketed roughly 220% year to date -- a performance that has pushed the GPU leader's market capitalization to roughly $1.15 trillion and delivered huge returns for investors.

But as striking as the rise of AI has been in 2023 the incredible technology is still very much in its infancy. Speaking at The New York Times’ annual DealBook Summit recently Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that AI technologies will be ""fairly competitive"" with humans within the next five years.

This prognostication is big news for AI investors and suggests that massive leaps forward will continue to take place in relatively short order. What would this mean for Nvidia stock?

Nvidia is at the heart of the AI revolution

Nvidia's graphics processing units were originally designed to power visuals for high-end computer games and visual applications. However the company eventually found that its GPUs were also well suited for other intensive computing processes and could be used as foundational hardware for cloud data centers. In turn advanced GPUs have also become the key hardware ingredient for running computationally intensive AI applications.

As impressive as ChatGPT and other AI apps already are Huang's recent comments that artificial intelligence systems could match human capabilities within the next five years point to incredible progress on the near horizon. If he's even close to correct the executive's forecast also points to an incredible demand outlook for the company's GPU hardware and accelerated-computing services.

Nvidia stock still has room for incredible performance

Despite its explosive gains over the last year Nvidia stock could still have room for huge gains over the long term. The company has delivered unprecedented performance beats with its quarterly reports -- blowing by both its own guidance and those issued by analysts.

For reference Nvidia posted non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings per share of $2.70 on sales of $13.51 billion in the second quarter. Meanwhile the average analyst estimate had called for per-share earnings of $2.09 on revenue of $11.22 billion in the period.

Even with signs of incredible momentum in Q2 Nvidia once again crushed Wall Street's expectations in the third quarter. The AI luminary recorded adjusted per-share earnings of $4.02 on revenue of $18.12 billion trouncing the average analyst estimate's call for per-share earnings of $3.37 on revenue of $16.18 billion.

For the current quarter Nvidia is guiding for sales of approximately $20 billion suggesting growth of 231% year over year. Meanwhile the company's midpoint target calls for a gross margin of 75% in the period ticking up from the already impressive 74% margin it posted in this year's second quarter.

Huang's comments hint at the possibility that Nvidia will once again crush expectations when it delivers its next earnings report. More importantly the CEO's five-year forecast seems to foreshadow technological shifts that will radically change how the world operates.

Nvidia currently controls roughly 90% of the market for high-end GPUs used to power AI and other accelerated computing applications. As might be inferred from such a dominant market share the company's tech is delivering substantial performance advantages compared to competing offerings.

If AI continues to make huge leaps forward at such a brisk pace the passage of time could show that Nvidia's already red-hot stock was actually quite cheap at today's prices.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlcnZldGhlaG9tZS5jb20vc3VwZXJtaWNyby00dS11bml2ZXJzYWwtZ3B1LXN5c3RlbS1mb3ItbGlxdWlkLWNvb2xlZC1udmlkaWEtaGd4LWgxMDAtYW5kLWhneC1oMjAwL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Supermicro 4U Universal GPU System for Liquid Cooled NVIDIA HGX H100 and HGX H200,"At SC23 we spotted the new Supermicro 4U Universal GPU system. This is a liquid-cooled system designed for the densest deployments. Since we have been doing a lot with liquid cooling we figured we would show this off as the team is going through photos from the show.

Supermicro 4U Universal GPU System for Liquid Cooled NVIDIA HGX H100 and HGX H200

At SC23 we took a look at the new Supermicro 4U Universal GPU system. Supermicro has a number of 8U models that are optimized for either air or liquid cooling but this design is specifically designed to take advantage of liquid cooling to dramatically increase density.

The liquid cooling manifold is a horizontal solution as we showed previously on STH. That allows the system’s cooling nozzles to be quickly disconnected from the manifold.

In this system the top tray is the NVIDIA HGX H100 8-GPU with NVSwitch tray. In the future Supermicro says it will support the HGX H200 GPUs.

We could not move the rack but behind the unit there are four power supplies (two installed) and a massive set of full-height and low-profile I/O expansion card slots. We also get the BMC’s out-of-band management port two USB 3 ports and a VGA port.

Pulling the CPU tray out we see a dual Intel Xeon server that is for either Sapphire Rapids (4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable) or the upcoming 5th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable (Emerald Rapids) CPUs. Each has a full set of 16 DDR5 DIMM slots for 32 total.

The CPUs in the system are liquid-cooled since Intel’s socket is designed for up to 385W TDP and typically higher-end CPUs are used in these GPU servers.

Something our readers will notice is that there are fans in this chassis. The fans allow Supermicro to cool the DIMMs M.2 SSDs 2.5″ SSDs and the rear I/O cards without needing cold plates on all of those devices.

One can see the two cages for 8x 2.5″ NVMe SSDs total on the front of the system here.

Final Words

Overall this new system follows Supermicro’s design philosophy for AI servers except for the fact it is primarily liquid-cooled. A 4U GPU server presents a challenge for cooling as they can use ~10kW of power each. Ten of these in a 45U rack would be 100kW. Using liquid cooling usually removes 10-15% of the power requirement but that is still 80-90kW in the rack before adding switches.

Supermicro has several large-scale GPU customers that can use liquid cooling are building more power and need more density. That is the type of customer this system is built for.

If you want to learn more about Supermicro liquid cooling we previously looked at the 8U Liquid Cooled Supermicro SYS-821GE-TNHR 8x NVIDIA H100 AI server and Supermicro’s custom liquid cooling rack.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vbWFya2V0cy5idXNpbmVzc2luc2lkZXIuY29tL25ld3Mvc3RvY2tzL252aWRpYS1qZW5zZW4taHVhbmctY2VvLXByb2ZpbGUtYWktc3RvY2stbWFya2V0LW52ZGEtcHJpY2UtMjAyMy0xMdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's Wildest Insights From a New Profile,"Bullishness on Nvidia has gripped Wall Street in 2023 and the stock is the top performer in the S&P 500 this year.

Nvidia woke investors up earlier this year to the fact that artificial intelligence is going to be a very big deal — and a very big business.

Shares of Nvidia have surged 226% year-to-date adding about $850 billion to its market value and making it the best performing stock in the S&P 500 in 2023.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has been called a visionary for betting his company on artificial intelligence years before the technology entered the mainstream. In a new profile by the New Yorker Huang revealed a slew of details about himself and his company.

Here are the six most interesting tidbits about Huang and Nvidia according to the recent profile.

1. Nvidia's corporate motto is that it's only 30 days from going out of business

Nvidia almost went out of business in 1996. The company had to lay off half of its staff and it was just a few weeks away from missing payroll. Huang said the company had a 50-50 chance of saving the business with the upcoming launch of its Riva 128 graphics chip.

The chip was a success but the desperation experienced in 1996 fueled what has become the company's unofficial corporate motto.

""Huang encouraged his employees to continue shipping products with a sense of desperation and for years to come he opened staff presentations with the words 'Our company is thirty days from going out of business"" The New Yorker wrote.

2. Nvidia embraces failure and puts it on full display

Jensen Huang has a radical belief that ""failure must be shared"" he told The New Yorker. And that's exactly what the company does.

After the launch of a faulty graphics chip in the early 2000's instead of firing the product managers Huang had them give a presentation to hundreds of employees about all of the decisions the team made leading up to launch of the failed product.

The chip had a loud overactive fan and Nvidia went as far to distribute a satirical video to the press in which the card was repurposed as a leaf blower.

3. Jensen Huang writes hundreds of e-mails every day

Nvidia has an agile corporate structure which means Huang participates in all facets of the business. That results in Huang responding to hundreds of e-mails every single day though each e-mail is usually only a few words long.

""One executive compared the e-mails to haiku another to ransom notes"" The New Yorker wrote.

4. Jensen Huang does not think AI is a threat to humanity

There's a lot of worry in the AI community that one day the technology could become powerful enough to overtake and replace its creators. Those concerns are shared by tech icons like Elon Musk and speculation suggests that those fears played a part in the OpenAI management fiasco earlier this month.

But Huang simply is not concerned about a doomsday scenario related to AI.

When asked if AI might someday kill somebody one Nvidia executive said ""Eh electricity kills people every year.""

Another question posed was whether AI might become self-aware one day but Huang wasn't buying it.

""In order for you to be a creature you have to be conscious. You have to have some knowledge of self right? I don't know where that could happen"" Huang said.

5. Huang encourages employees to develop products for ""zero-billion-dollar markets""

A bulk of Nvidia's success can be chalked up to the company skating to where the puck is going years in advance. And Huang encourages that level of thinking as its employees develop new products.

Huang calls it the ""zero-billion-dollar market."" These exploratory products might not have competitors or even potential customers today but that could change years down the road.

Huang compared this idea of thinking to the movie ""Field of Dreams"" in which the main character builds a baseball field in the middle of a cornfield then waits for players and fans to come

6. Huang's big gamble on the future is the Omniverse

Huang took big risks over the past few decades betting his company could develop technology for a market that didn't yet exist.

When asked what Nvidia might be doing today that mirrors the ""zero-billion-dollar"" bets the company took in years past Huang responded with a single word: ""Omniverse.""

Huang said the Omniverse is an ""industrial metaverse"" that will be able to simulate the real world at an incredibly fine level of detail. The Omniverse could ultimately enable humans to safely train robots and self-driving cars in a digital world.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vZm9ydHVuZS5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8wMi9haS1jaGlwLWV4cG9ydC1jb250cm9scy1jaGluYS1udmlkaWEtcmFpbW9uZG8v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AI chip export controls on China underfunded: Raimondo,"US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said her department needs more money to stop China from catching up on cutting-edge semiconductors.

“We cannot let China get these chips. Period” she said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley California on Saturday. “We’re going to deny them our most cutting-edge technology.”

To do that Raimondo said the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security which manages export controls for the US needs more funding from Congress.

“I have a $200 million budget. That’s like the cost of a few fighter jets. Come on” she said. “If we’re serious let’s go fund this operation like it needs to be funded.”

Raimondo said American companies will need to adapt to US national security priorities including export controls that her department has placed on semiconductor exports.

“I know there are CEOs of chip companies in this audience who were a little cranky with me when I did that because you’re losing revenue” she said. “Such is life. Protecting our national security matters more than short-term revenue.”

Raimondo called out Nvidia Corp. which designed chips specifically for the Chinese market after the US imposed its initial round of curbs in October 2022.

“If you redesign a chip around a particular cut line that enables them to do AI I’m going to control it the very next day” Raimondo said.

The Commerce Department updated the semiconductor curbs this fall to capture Nvidia’s made-for-China chips — and the company responded by designing three new AI components for the Asian country.

Communication with China can help stabilize ties between the two countries but “on matters of national security we’ve got to be eyes wide open about the threat” she said.

“This is the biggest threat we’ve ever had and we need to meet the moment” she said.

We've been checking retail prices in the U.S. monthly on all of the latest graphics cards and we decided to take a closer look at the trends as 2023 winds down. Many of these rank among the best graphics cards including the Nvidia RTX 40-series AMD RX 7000-series and Intel Arc GPUs.



Prices do fluctuate quite a bit within a month — for example during November's Black Friday and Cyber Monday madness we saw prices on many of these GPUs drop by up to 20%. Except some of those ""drops"" were relative to pre-inflated prices from the start of November. That's just one of the many things that show up in our charts. The other major highlight is just how much RTX 4090 prices have increased in the past few months. Overall though we see surprising consistency in pricing on most models since June with just a few wild swings up or down.



We have pricing tables alongside the charts below with U.S. prices as of December 1 2023 though if you want up-to-date pricing check our GPU price index. We've dropped Nvidia's RTX 30-series from the list as it's mostly discontinued now (other than 3050/3060 cards). And again note that these are retail prices for new graphics cards — we've eliminated refurbished used and open-box listings from consideration.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Nvidia GeForce RTX 40-Series Pricing GPU Model Best US Price Lowest-Ever U.S. Price GeForce RTX 4090 $1999 $1549 GeForce RTX 4080 $1249 $989 GeForce RTX 4070 Ti $759 $714 GeForce RTX 4070 $574 $514 GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB $449 $404 GeForce RTX 4060 Ti $379 $329 GeForce RTX 4060 $299 $279

Most of the RTX 40-series pricing has been relatively static perhaps with a very slight downward trend. The major exception is the RTX 4090 which has shot up from a low of around $1550 back in June to over $2000 at present. The primary cause appears to be the U.S. export restrictions on the RTX 4090 which has caused some people to begin hoarding RTX 4090 cards — which they'll have to try to sneak into China most likely.



This in turn appears to have had a slight knock-on effect where the RTX 4080 prices have increased around 10% since early November though we did at least see some decent sales on that GPU during the Black Friday / Cyber Monday timeframe. There's also the rumored impending launch of the RTX 4080 Super which will likely replace the vanilla 4080. So clearing out ""old"" inventory before that launch (likely in January) makes sense.



The RTX 4070 Ti and below are all basically flat in terms of price trends though the 4070 Ti has dropped a bit from its $799 launch price and the same goes for the RTX 4060 Ti. Those both had... well let's just call them overly ambitious prices on the part of Nvidia. The Black Friday deals on several of those brought them down to where we really feel they should have stayed but we'll have to see where the various rumored RTX 40-series Super models land. RTX 4060 has dropped $10 from its launch MSRP with a few minor fluctuations — though note that as with all of the least expensive GPUs sometimes the cheapest models have worse cooling and noise characteristics.

Swipe to scroll horizontally AMD RX 7000-Series Pricing GPU Model Best US Price Lowest-Ever U.S. Price Radeon RX 7900 XTX $909 $889 Radeon RX 7900 XT $749 $689 Radeon RX 7800 XT $499 $499 Radeon RX 7700 XT $429 $429 Radeon RX 7600 $249 $239

AMD's RX 7000-series has been a bit sporadic of late particularly on the top RTX 7900 XTX and RTX 7900 XT models. Those hit their best relative lows in October but again we saw some good deals near the end of last month. There are rumors the RX 7900 XTX could start to see higher prices due to the RTX 4090 shenanigans mentioned above though so far it's at least staying below its launch MSRP. The 7900 XT meanwhile saw an upward blip at the start of November before falling back to roughly the same price as in October — likely an attempt to make those BF/CM ""deals"" look more enticing.



The RX 7800 XT and RX 7700 XT have seen very little movement since they launched in mid-July. As noted at the time the 7800 XT was the more desirable card and with only a $50 price premium most people should look to that GPU. This is probably why the 7700 XT has dropped $20. RX 7600 meanwhile shows the same minor blip at the start of November but has generally been selling in the $240–$250 range.

We've split the AMD RX 6000-series into two charts as there are so many of them available. Obviously availability of the RX 6950 XT and RX 6900 XT has become far less predictable and we suspect most of those were sold off during BF/CM this past month — one final hurrah for the highest performance RDNA 2 GPUs. Just in time too as there's not much reason to pay more for one of those GPUs when the RX 7800 XT delivers similar performance alongside some new features.



Nearly everything below the top two models has been on a steady downward trend basically going back to last year's RDNA 3 launches. The only exception is the RX 6700 10GB which was never widely available and now seems to be largely out of stock — Newegg no longer lists any cards and prices are flat since last month after increasing from August through November.



The RX 6600-class and below also saw a jump in prices between June and July and in many cases we haven't quite matched the previous low.

Swipe to scroll horizontally Intel Arc A-Series Pricing GPU Model Best US Price Lowest-Ever U.S. Price Intel Arc A770 16GB $259 $249 Intel Arc A770 8GB $307 $199 Intel Arc A750 $169 $169 Intel Arc A580 $179 $169 Intel Arc A380 $119 $99

Intel's Arc GPUs had some of the best deals during Black Friday but now they're back to ""normal."" The Arc A750 remains an impressive deal currently matching the newer (and slower) Arc A580 on price. The A770 8GB seems to be largely out of stock or at least prices increased a lot since October's low of $239 — and it was briefly on sale for $199 for Black Friday. Now it costs as much as the more desirable A770 16GB and it's hard to justify the existence of the A770 8GB when the A750 and A580 overlap it in so many ways.



As for the bottom-tier A380 (we haven't tracked the A310) we've routinely seen it selling at $100 including during much of November. But now the cheapest models are back to $120. If you're still thinking about picking up an A380 we suggest waiting for the next sale to drop it below $100. There's not much point in spending more than that when the sales are so frequent."

The department’s annual “Shop with a Cop” event gave a number of children in grades K-5 the opportunity to pick out Christmas gifts for themselves and many shopped for others in their families as well.

Children who participate are selected by local school staff and are then paired with an officer who helped them “shop ‘till they drop” at Meijer 7701 Green Bay Road. This year there were 45 children participating in the event.

Once all the gifts are purchased they are then wrapped by volunteers at the event.

Spending money for the event is donated by people and businesses in the Kenosha area.

In addition to the shopping there were doughnuts and a variety of beverages available for children and families to enjoy along with temporary tattoos stickers and other child-friendly activities offered by the Westosha Central High School Volunteers program.

Comfort for a Cause donated blankets to all participants and Livy’s Living Legacy sponsored a shopping trip.

Morgan Shepperd a Kenosha Police office associate who spends time organizing the event said her favorite part of the event is “seeing everyone come together.”

“(And) just watching the kids’ faces light up and making their Christmas morning” she said.

Kenosha Police Detective Pete Deates said the event couldn’t happen without the support of the community.

“I think it’s really neat that the community sees how beneficial this is for the kids and for the officers” he said.

Officer Cassie Botica volunteered for the event for a third year Saturday. “I just like seeing how happy (children) are to get all the things that they like ... I love giving back to the community and the kids in this community. Kids are all really great and it’s nice to see them get things that they deserve.”

Mahniya Schopper 9 went shopping for herself and her family with officer Kailyn Torres. After selecting items for her family Schopper said her favorite part was “all of it.”

For Torres the event is a full-circle moment because her son was once a student selected to participate in Shop with a Cop.

“I get to be an officer in it now and it’s my favorite (especially) getting to know Mahniyah. She’s a very grateful and sweet child” Torres said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJpY2hsYW5kc291cmNlLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEyLzAzL21pZC1vaGlvLXNwb3J0cy1jYXItY291cnNlLXdpbGwtbm90LWhlYXItbmFzY2FyLXJvYXJzLWluLTIwMjQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course will not hear NASCAR roars in 2024,"LEXINGTON — The roars from the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course in 2024 will not include any engines from the three primary NASCAR series.

But it may just be a temporary departure from NASCAR which was first seen and heard at the permanent road course near Lexington in 2013 when the NASCAR Xfinity Series rolled through north central Ohio.

Officials at Mid-Ohio announced the track’s 63rd season of racing a few days ago a schedule that will feature five major spectator events spread across 11 weeks in 2024.

“With the ever-evolving NASCAR schedule neither NASCAR Xfinity Series nor the NASCAR CRAFTSMAN Truck Series will be racing at Mid-Ohio next summer” said Jack Carney coordinator of marketing and communications at the track.

“But we are optimistic that one of the series will return in the future” Carney told Richland Source.

Next season’s schedule features the annual NTT INDYCAR SERIES race weekend and the much-anticipated return of Superbikes and IMSA sports car racing.

In conjunction with the schedule release the renewal period for Mid-Ohio Season Race Passes has begun and will run through Dec. 18.

The NASCAR Xfinity series raced at Mid-Ohio from 2013 to 2019 and again in 2021. The NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series raced on the course in 2022 and 2023 with the O’Reilly Auto Parts 150.

The only year NASCAR was not at Mid-Ohio in the last decade was 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic when the event was cancelled.

Carney said Mid-Ohio just underwent a full repavement.

“That should help us keep and/or attract major series moving forward” he said.

“Our company Green Savoree Racing Promotions which owns Mid-Ohio works with NASCAR to promote an annual Xfinity Series race in Portland. So we still work closely with NASCAR folks and I think those conversations will be ongoing relating to Mid-Ohio” Carney said.

However a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes the company is worth looking at. Particularly we will be paying attention to Occidental Petroleum's ROE today.

Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.

View our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum

How Is ROE Calculated?

ROE can be calculated by using the formula:

Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity

So based on the above formula the ROE for Occidental Petroleum is:

19% = US$5.4b ÷ US$29b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).

The 'return' is the yearly profit. So this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments the company generates a profit of $0.19.

What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?

So far we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"" and how effectively it does so we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.

A Side By Side comparison of Occidental Petroleum's Earnings Growth And 19% ROE

To start with Occidental Petroleum's ROE looks acceptable. Even so when compared with the average industry ROE of 23% we aren't very excited. Still we can see that Occidental Petroleum has seen a remarkable net income growth of 27% over the past five years. We believe that there might be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. However not to forget the company does have a decent ROE to begin with just that it is lower than the industry average. So this certainly also provides some context to the high earnings growth seen by the company.

As a next step we compared Occidental Petroleum's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 33% in the same period.

Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings whichever the case may be is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is OXY fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value has everything you need to know.

Is Occidental Petroleum Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?

Occidental Petroleum has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 2.3% meaning that it has the remaining 98% left over to reinvest into its business. So it looks like Occidental Petroleum is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business which shows in its earnings growth.

Besides Occidental Petroleum has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 16% over the next three years. However the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the higher expected payout ratio.

Conclusion

In total we are pretty happy with Occidental Petroleum's performance. Particularly we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business at a moderate rate of return. Unsurprisingly this has led to an impressive earnings growth. With that said the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber said the pledges were part of his efforts to proactively engage with oil and gas companies during the talks. Jaber has faced a number of negative headlines over his concurrent role as the CEO of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.

""If we want to accelerate progress across the climate agenda we must bring everyone in to be accountable and responsible for climate action"" said Jaber. ""We must all focus on reducing emissions and apply a positive can-do vision to drive climate action and get everyone to take action. We need a clear action plan and I am determined to deliver one.""

The agreement is part of a Global Decarbonization Accelerator launched at COP28 focused on three pillars: energy systems of the future such as renewables and hydrogen; the fossil fuel sector and emission-intensive industries; and methane.

Under the oil and gas pillar the industrial transition accelerator will focus on decarbonization across key heavy-emitting sectors: cement aluminum steel oil and gas power and aviation/maritime.

The 50 oil and gas companies account for 40% of global oil production. The net zero commitment relates to scope 1 and 2 emissions a COP28 presidency spokesman said.

Key national oil companies such as Kuwait Petroleum Corporation QatarEnergy Iraq's State Oil Marketing Company China's Sinopec CNOOC and PetroChina and the National Iranian Oil Company were missing from this list.

This comes as many investors and activists don't believe the industry has done enough and they have doubled down on efforts to put these companies under pressure. Many fossil fuel producers will be forced to balance the need to maximize shareholders' financial returns with pressures to decarbonize.

Methane challenge

On methane the agreement sees the 50 companies commit to setting interim targets that would reduce methane emissions to 0.2% of oil and natural gas production by 2030 and to end routine flaring.

What makes this pledge distinctive is that it will be scrutinized using technology and data.

The United Nations Environment Program's International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO) the Environmental Defense Fund and the International Energy Agency will help monitor compliance by tracking methane emissions using satellite data and other analytical tools.

Fred Krupp president of the non-profit advocacy group the Environmental Defense Fund said the pledge had the potential to be the most impactful climate action in over three decades.

""It could lower the planet's temperature and reduce cataclysmic storms from what we will otherwise experience in the next decade"" he said.

Methane accounts for 45% to 50% of oil and gas emissions 80% of it from upstream the spokesperson said. The methane pledge includes zero routine flaring by 2030 he added.

The US and China will separately continue their conversation on methane reduction a spokesman for the COP28 presidency said.

The energy sector -- including oil natural gas coal and bioenergy -- accounts for nearly 40% of methane emissions from human activity.

MPC demand low

Methane emissions generated by production are a significant contributor to the carbon intensity of natural gas.

Platts part of S&P Global Commodity Insights assesses methane performance certificates traded in the spot market that represent low methane emissions in natural gas production in the US and Canada.

Each MPC represents 1 MMBtu of gas with zero methane emissions produced. Platts reflects MPCs that have been issued against production that has a methane intensity of less than 0.10%.

Prices have fallen to just $0.01/MPC in recent months with very little demand for the certificates at present.

Many countries and governments are gradually starting to enforce measures to curtail methane leaks and emissions.

In November the EU reached a landmark political agreement on a regulation for tracking and reducing methane emissions in the energy sector -- the first-ever EU law to curb methane emissions.

Similarly in early-November China issued an action plan to control methane emissions that establishes a broad framework for measurement and identifies selected industries for future implementation.

According to the International Energy Agency if all methane leaks from fossil fuel operations in 2021 had been captured and sold then gas markets would have been supplied with an additional 180 Bcm of gas.

The IEA said that was equivalent to all the gas used in Europe's power sector. Marketing gas that is lost would also be profitable for producers given sustained high international gas prices.

If Only She Could ...,"The Education of Judith Kimerling: An American lawyer’s epic struggle to stop expanding oil operations harming Indigenous peoples in Ecuador’s Amazon. Part one.

QUITO Ecuador—On a cloudy March afternoon I found Judith Kimerling sitting amid a sea of cardboard boxes filled with documents books and other papers—vestiges of 30 years of her work in Ecuador. For the time being she’s decided to keep the two nine-foot-long blow guns that were gifted to her in a storage locker.

“I haven’t figured out how I can get those home” she said without a trace of irony.

Kimerling an American professor with silver-gray curls and soft green eyes is a longtime Indigenous rights attorney and environmental activist. She is here in Quito for work on what is one of the most important human rights court cases most people have never heard of.

About seven months earlier she appeared in a Brasilia courtroom as part of that case. Kimerling’s client Tewe Dayuma Michela Conta goes by Conta and is a 17-year old Indigenous girl who lived the first 6 or 7 years of her life in the Amazon rainforest with her family uncontacted by the outside world.

The case in Brasilia held before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights is the first in which a court of law will rule on the rights of “uncontacted” peoples also known as “Indigenous peoples living in voluntary isolation” though in Ecuador they are often referred to as “aislados” the Spanish word for isolated peoples.

Judith Kimerling appears before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights on August 23 2022. Credit: Courtesy of the Inter American Court of Human Rights. Ecuador’s aislados are on the verge of losing the last remaining territories upon which their physical and cultural survival depends. The fact that Kimerling’s home country has driven so much of that process is not lost on her. America has long been the biggest purchaser of the crude oil extracted from Ecuador’s Amazonian region. The outcome of the Inter-American case known as the Tagaeri and Taromenane Indigenous Peoples vs. Ecuador will also have implications for dozens of similar isolated family groups and recently contacted Indigenous peoples living throughout South America. That’s because the Inter-American Court of Human Rights has binding jurisdiction over 20 countries including Ecuador Brazil and Peru. The central issue is whether the Ecuadorian government has violated Conta’s rights and those of Ecuador’s aislados and if so what officials must do to remedy those violations and prevent future ones. A ruling could be issued in the coming weeks or months.

As Kimerling sees it the case has everything to do with Ecuador’s powerful oil industry. Since the 1960s the industry has continually expanded while Indigenous people like Conta and her family have been displaced contaminated and attacked. Kimerling and Conta’s main aim is to safeguard as much of the remaining rainforest as possible and protect the lives and rights of Conta and the aislados.

Now sifting through the cardboard boxes she pulls out a copy of “Amazon Crude” her 1991 expose of oil production in Ecuador. The book shot Kimerling to fame among environmentalists and rights activists for blowing the whistle on the operations of the American multinational Texaco (now Chevron) and the catastrophic impact the company had on Indigenous peoples.

The New York Times called the book the “Silent Spring of Ecuador ” in a nod to Rachel Carson. Kimerling’s investigation led directly to highly controversial litigation brought against Chevron on behalf of affected colonists and Indigenous people that is still reverberating three decades later in the U.S. International and Ecuadorian courts—litigation Kimerling refused to join for ethical and legal reasons. The cover of Kimerling’s “Amazon Crude.” Kimerling hands me the near-pristine copy of the book. Earlier I had been grumbling that I could only find Amazon Crude for sale online from secondhand sellers who listed it for hundreds of dollars. That I had come to learn had an interesting backstory involving the current independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. the National Resource Defense Council and ConocoPhillips. It is one of the many jaw-dropping anecdotes I’ve learned about Kimerling and her trailblazing career that are not widely known. Kimerling is clearly uncomfortable being the center of attention. I ran my fingers over the crisp pages of my copy of Amazon Crude and thanked Kimerling for it. She lifted her shoulders and shrugged.

“I wish telling the story was enough but it’s not” she said referring to Ecuador’s still advancing oil frontier and persistent contamination.

“I haven’t yet figured out a formula to stop it.”

“So Can I”

The granddaughter of Jewish immigrants Kimerling grew up in Birmingham Alabama acutely aware of the privilege she had because of her white skin in the segregated Deep South. But she was also cognizant of antisemitism. Her father built a family business the Alabama Oxygen Company and was an early pioneer of solar energy as well as a masterful storyteller. Her mother was a leader in the Jewish community and at the comprehensive cancer center at the University of Alabama-Birmingham Medical School where she held numerous board offices.

Much of Kimerling’s life was conspicuously saturated in fossil fuels. She remembers going to the local Texaco gas station and seeing the company’s television commercials which etched into her mind the image of the Texaco man his red and white star and the slogan “You can trust your car to the man who wears the star.”

She attended the University of Michigan where she majored in American studies and had her first personal encounter with the limits of the law. She was fired from her cashier job at an Ann Arbor Drug store after refusing the advance of her older male boss. Taken aback by what had happened she paged through the phone book and called the U.S. Department of Labor to complain. Someone at the agency explained to her that she could be fired for any reason—at the time sexual harassment was not defined as a category of sex discrimination under the law. That didn’t happen until 1980.

Knowing she never wanted to be in a vulnerable position like that again she decided to pursue an advanced degree thinking it would give her the economic security to always be able to say no to the boss. Law school seemed like a pragmatic next step that could open doors and so she arrived in New Haven Connecticut in the fall of 1979 at Yale Law School.

From the moment she arrived Kimerling felt as though she didn’t quite fit in with the legal culture. The school was a well-known conveyor belt to corporate firms and public offices and proudly displayed the portraits of its renowned male alumni on the walls.

Less than one-third of her class was women and with only one female professor she felt for the first time in her life that sometimes a subtle message was sent that she wasn’t as good as a man. It prompted her to develop a mantra she would come back to throughout her career: If other people can do the job so can I.

At Yale she began to consider the type of lawyer she wanted to become. During her first year torts class when a professor posed a hypothetical about how the students would advise a cosmetics company that produced a nail polish responsible for an allergic reaction in only some people one classmate suggested the company place a warning on the packaging. Another student interjected—doing so could cause the company to lose market share suggesting that the company should pay aggrieved people off rather than disclose the risk. Almost involuntarily the words “Oh. My. God” fell out of Kimerling’s mouth stilling the class she remembered.

So as her classmates marched off to interviews wearing the suits they kept in their lockers Kimerling called occupational disease clinics around the country. She did a brief stint at a plaintiffs’ law firm involved in asbestos-related work before taking a job at the New York Attorney General’s office.

In January 1985 she settled into her new office on the 47th floor of the World Trade Center’s second tower to begin work on a case known as “Love Canal.” For her the job would be an education in the legal and social impacts of massive amounts of toxic waste.

Love Canal

In the late 1970s working-class families living near a former Hooker Chemical Company waste site in Niagara Falls began reporting that toxic waste had migrated into home basements and backyards. After the community demanded answers President Jimmy Carter declared the site a federal disaster area. The state and federal governments would eventually spend hundreds of millions of dollars on remedial measures including the purchasing of over 200 abandoned homes.

The main part of Kimerling’s job as an assistant attorney general was to help the state recover the money it had expended on remedies at Love Canal and to work with the state’s environmental experts to negotiate remedies at other waste sites. Kimerling who has a preternatural ability to hone in on important details learned the ins and outs of toxic waste cleanup including what questions to ask and whom to ask them of.

Kimerling’s office did battle with Occidental Chemical Company Hooker Chemical’s successor over the company’s insistence that their conversations with the state be confidential. “They said they didn’t want to negotiate in a fishbowl” Kimerling recalled. The possibility of shrouding how such a contentious agreement is made is always tempting in dealmaking but Kimerling’s office resisted. She said the situation taught her how important transparency is and that the public’s participation put the attorney general’s office in a stronger negotiating position. “I knew we would have to defend whatever terms we agreed upon to the people in Niagara Falls” Kimerling explained.

As her remedial negotiations wrapped up Kimerling began to think about what was next for her.

She had become interested in a growing fight in 1988 to stop the destruction of rainforests. That year marked a global shift in awareness around environmental issues. It was the year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was created and when the expanding hole in the ozone layer began to capture international public attention.

Kimerling had seen the Amazon rainforest before during a gap-year trip she took between college and law school. She had traveled on her own to among other places a small Ecuadorian town called Francisco de Orellana commonly known as Coca. The city was founded in 1969 two years after Texaco struck oil in the region.

Now nearly a decade later at 32 she thought about Ecuador and how with seven years of environmental law experience she might have something useful to contribute to the world’s rainforest crusade. Kimerling realized she couldn’t contribute much from afar and decided that the best thing a North American lawyer could do was to meet local people who wanted to protect their forest and help them. She reached out to the Natural Resources Defense Council which hired Kimerling as its Latin America Representative.

Knowing she could always come back home put on a suit and pair of high heels and practice law again Kimerling put in her notice at work. After spending years of her life looking at disease and contamination caused by toxic substances she looked forward to spending her days in the beauty of the rainforest. She couldn’t have imagined just how wrong she was. What awaited her was far worse than Love Canal.

In Ecuador “I Want to See Everything”

On Valentine’s day in 1989 energized with the sense of adventure Kimerling packed everything she could fit into her suitcases and hopped on a flight from New York City to Quito Ecuador’s capital city.

She carried one bag filled with books seeking to learn as much as she could about Ecuador and the rainforest. The geographically diverse Latin American nation straddles the center of the Earth and is home to three diverse ecosystems: the Galapagos Islands and coastal plains in the west snowcapped Andes mountains in its center and the upper Amazon basin in the east. In surface area the nation is smaller than the state of Nevada but is home to about 8 percent of the Earth’s amphibians 5 percent of Earth’s reptiles 8 percent of Earth’s mammals and 16 percent of Earth’s birds. Most of the land that is now Ecuador had been part of the Inca Empire until the Spanish conquest in the 16th century. Politically until the 1970s the nation teetered between military dictatorships and civilian control and has since gone through periods of political instability. Economically Ecuador had primarily exported commodities like bananas chocolate and coffee but since Texaco’s 1967 discovery of oil in the country’s Amazonian region petroleum has been the nation’s largest export and the United States its biggest buyer.

Kimerling had read that oil production itself did not cause harm to the rainforest but that the roads companies built to access wells were the primary sources of environmental damage. Those roads led to colonization and the growth of other industries like agriculture and logging. The information echoed what NRDC had told her about large development projects being an area of concern.

Not one for excesses Kimerling settled into a sparsely furnished two-bedroom apartment. Though it lacked a TV and refrigerator she brought with her one indulgence: a digital cassette player and speakers along with a bundle of mix tapes filled with ‘80s dance music and jazz. At an art gallery opening in Quito she met an American expat who was working as a consultant for a U.S. oil company. He assured her that the company too was upset by how colonists using company roads hurt the forest through road construction. But something about the conversation made her begin questioning the prevailing wisdom that oil operations did not harm the forest.

In May 1989 Kimerling traveled back to Coca the Amazonian town she had visited before starting law school and met with the local Kichwa Indigenous organization FCUNAE (Federation of United Communes of the Kichwa Nationality of the Ecuadorian Amazon). Kimerling said she asked the leaders of FCUNAE if oil operations were causing contamination. Initially the group didn’t know the word “contaminación” but when Kimerling explained what it meant recognition instantly flashed across their faces.

The organization’s members showed Kimerling where a ruptured pipeline had spilled nearly 300000 gallons of oil into the Napo river turning the water and surrounding soil and plants black and affecting families living as far into the forest as near the Peruvian border. The spill affected more than 550 families who among other injuries lost their gardens—a crucial source of sustenance.

In palm-roofed huts she sat and listened to people’s experiences of life on the oil frontier. Unlike some of the “greens” (what her sources called American environmentalists) who occasionally came through Quito Kimerling gladly visited communities accepted shared meals and slept on palm-wood floors in her sleeping bag. In a photograph from that time period Kimerling with a crop of dark curly hair and a wide smile is kneeling down in front of a wooden home in the forest. She’s next to a leader of FCUNAE and both she and the man are petting a baby tapir—an Amazonian mammal that looks like a cross between a baby horse and an anteater.

It was during her first trip into the forest that Kimerling with her notebook and camera in hand saw her first waste pit. It was one of more than 1000 that Texaco operating in a consortium with Ecuador’s state-run oil company used to dispose of formation water and drilling waste both hazardous byproducts of oil extraction filled with heavy metals and other toxic chemicals. Even for someone familiar with mass chemical waste the sites and smells in the forest horrified her.

She thought about how after Love Canal American companies knew that they couldn’t just dig a hole in the ground fill it with waste and walk away. But here Kimerling had discovered that Texaco which had marketed itself as using “best international practices” was doing just that in the middle of the rainforest—back home some U.S. states had long since outlawed the indiscriminate dumping of drilling waste and federal law banned the onshore dumping off oilfield wastewater. Locals told her about their afflictions including skin rashes miscarriages birth defects and breathing issues. Livestock and animals died prematurely devastating already impoverished farmers. “I want to see everything” she told the locals.

Kimerling’s experience working at Love Canal led her to seek out the advice of technical experts to make sense of how the sloppy waste management practices she had witnessed could impact human health and the environment. She tracked down an American living in Ecuador at the time named Mark Cullen a respected occupational medicine doctor. Soon Cullen became a go-to resource when Kimerling had technical questions or when she got access to chemical data and wanted to be sure she understood it correctly. Whether because of her disarming southern nature or her genuine desire to understand government and oil officials voluntarily gave Kimerling information about oil operations otherwise kept from the public. She learned among other things what officials knew about the amount of spills and waste discharges and that oil and drilling waste products like produced water and sludge are highly toxic and can harm aquatic life even at very low concentrations.

Kimerling also got an education in the political and social contexts of the oil patch while heading off to a community protest against Texaco. Kimerling and her companions were stopped at a military camp outside of Coca where officials questioned where the group was headed then promptly detained them. Kimerling was taken to a jail in Coca but when officials ordered her into a dank windowless concrete cell filled with men she refused to enter. Taking in the cell’s stench of sweat and urine Kimerling harnessed all of her indignation declaring: “I’m not going in there.”

She alternately professed her innocence questioned why she had been detained and demanded to speak with the U.S. Embassy. An officer told her she was being held because she had been talking about contamination. “You should go home and talk about contamination in the United States” he snapped. She was allowed to stay in the jail’s courtyard where she sat for hours without food water or toilet paper and not knowing what would happen.

Kimerling convinced the officers to release her for the night on the promise that she would stay in a hotel that evening and come back—something that was all but assured as the police had confiscated her passport. The next day a leader of an Amazonian Indigenous group came to the jail and negotiated Kimerling’s release. She also found out that friends of hers in Quito had also been hounding the U.S. Embassy to intervene.

The experience was the first but not the last time Kimerling witnessed first-hand the arbitrary use of power against people who had done nothing wrong.

“Amazon Crude”

Kimerling spent June of 1989 writing a report that would eventually become “Amazon Crude” a 132-page heavily endnoted tome on Ecuador’s oil industry.

Her writing resonated with locals but before long Kimerling became ill. When she went to doctors in Quito no one could figure out what was wrong with her. Finally after months of her health deteriorating a gastrointestinal specialist determined she had a tapeworm and five major parasites including one linked to the bacterial infection shigella. Kimerling returned to her parents’ home in Birmingham where she was successfully treated. After she recovered she received stinging news from her contact at NRDC that the organization wasn’t interested in Amazon Crude.

With her illness fresh in her mind Kimerling doubted whether she should continue living in Ecuador and she returned to Quito to pack up her apartment. That’s when she got a phone call that changed her life.

On the other line was an NRDC official who told her that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. the nephew of the former U.S. president was leading a “rescue the rainforest” campaign for the organization as its celebrity spokesperson. NRDC asked Kimerling to take Kennedy then a crusading environmental lawyer into the forest. In July 1990 she acted as Kennedy’s guide into the Ecuadorian Amazon taking him and a group from NRDC to see waste pits local communities and once-pristine forested areas now covered in oil and chemical waste.

Moved by what he saw Kennedy pushed for NRDC to publish her work and wrote the forward to Amazon Crude. “Like most U.S. citizens I like to believe that when American companies go abroad American values go with them. This hasn’t happened in Ecuador. Today American-owned companies are leaving an ugly legacy of poverty and contamination in one of the most important forests on earth” he wrote.

Published in 1991 Amazon Crude is an exhaustive account of the environmental and human impacts of every stage of oil operations. Texaco plays a starring role in the book having dumped at least 3.2 million gallons of toxic produced water per day flared nearly 50 million cubic feet of noxious gas daily and spilled 17 million gallons of crude from the main pipeline alone in the rainforest during its three decades of Ecuadorian operations Kimerling found. The company also “set the precedents and standards for oil operations” in the country since Ecuador lacked the technological know-how—the Andean nation’s lead export Kimerling wrote had been bananas before Texaco struck oil in 1967.

Her photos depicted an apocalyptic scene: plumes of black smoke emanating from torched waste pits filled with thick black gunk across decimated landscapes and pipes spewing toxic sludge into waterways.

Kimerling’s sharp economic analysis concluded that despite early promises that the discovery of oil would transform Ecuador’s economy the country remained hooked on oil and burdened by large amounts of foreign debt—insights that remain true today.

The toll and rapid changes that oil operations thrust upon Indigenous communities were emphasized heavily throughout the book. In a highlighted section entitled “The Tagaeri The Last Uncontacted People of the Oriente” Kimerling wrote about the 1987 killing of two Capuchin missionaries Bishop Alejandro Labacoa and Sister Ines Arango who had sought to de-escalate tensions between the Tagaeri (coincidentally the family of the uncontacted girl Conta who would much later become Kimerling’s client) and oil companies seeking to expel them from Tagaeri ancestral lands rich in oil. Labacoa and Arango had been pinned to the forest floor with multiple spears and their deaths had attracted international attention at the time. Kimerling wrote that the killing of the missionaries overshadowed an attempt by oil companies to use armed mercenaries to murder the Tagaeri who stood in the way of oil operations. It is widely believed that the Tagaeri’s leader Taga was killed by oil workers.

Kimerling’s book sent ripples throughout the country and region. In a Quito-based newspaper a leading columnist questioned why it had taken a North American to publicize what was happening in Ecuador. Kimerling received so many threats in the wake of the book’s publication that U.S. embassy officials intervened and introduced her to Ecuadorian officials. The reaction of Texaco and its consortium partner the state-run oil company Petroecuador were swift. Texaco denied wrongdoing and defended itself on the basis that it hadn’t violated any Ecuadorian laws—the country at the time had virtually no environmental regulations. Kimerling questioned this recalling from her Yale torts class that the first source of environmental law didn’t come from regulations but from the common law. She then read cover to cover the entire Ecuadorian civil code confirming that there were nuisance and other laws that the company had seemingly violated. It’s just that no one had enforced them.

Back in the United States her work inspired Congressional legislation entitled the “Pan-American Cultural Survival Act” aimed at assisting Indigenous peoples throughout the Americas to protect their lands and the environment as well as the “political empowerment” of Indigenous peoples. During a March 211991 hearing Sen. Alan Cranston (D.-Calif.) likened America’s treatment of Native Americans to the current situation of Latin America’s Indigenous peoples. Citing Kimerling’s work the senator highlighted the oil industry’s “grave threat” to the “physical and cultural survival” of Ecuador’s Indigenous peoples. “We are linked as fellow humans to the fate of Indigenous peoples because the areas in which many of them live—the rainforests of Central and South America—are vital sources of oxygen and a biological diversity the importance of which modern science is only beginning to understand” Cranston said at the hearing.

Another American oil company operating in Ecuador put pressure on the then-U.S. ambassador to Ecuador Paul Lambert to publicly extol the importance of oil development to U.S.-Ecuador relations. But after meeting with Kimerling and others Lambert decided to visit the forest. By that time Texaco had turned over control of operations to Petroecuador. Following Lambert’s visit a cable was sent from the American Embassy in Quito to President George Bush and his secretary of state:

“By most accounts Petroecuador’s treatment of the environment is the worst of all the oil companies in Ecuador. In part this is because it inherited from Texaco established fields where the existing equipment and procedures do not reflect current industry practices.”

Kimerling’s research prompted U.S. oil companies to start rhetorically distinguishing themselves from Texaco and make the claim that they could extract oil from the forest in an “environmentally friendly way that benefited local communities.”

She wondered: Could it be possible?

“You Don’t Want Me as Your Enemy”

Around the time Kimerling was writing Amazon Crude the U.S. oil company Conoco discovered commercial quantities of crude inside previously undeveloped areas of the rainforest known as Oil Block 16. That oil sat underneath the ancestral territories of some Indigenous Waorani family groups the most recently contacted of Ecuador’s Indigenous peoples who had been entirely cut out of the Ecuadorian government’s decision to allow Conoco to explore for oil in the area.

Kimerling had worked on a January 1990 letter sent to the World Bank and Ecuadorian government that included a demand that Indigenous groups be given legal title to their lands and that ongoing oil operations like Conoco’s stop unless and until their consent is obtained. NRDC had asked Kimerling to write the letter and she used the opportunity to bring together environmental and Indigenous groups to draft it.

And so she was surprised to receive a call from Kennedy asking her to negotiate a deal with Conoco officials and sell it to groups in Ecuador. According to Kimerling Kennedy explained that oil drilling would go forward with or without Conoco as the operator and since Conoco promised its operations would be environmentally friendly and benefit locals Kimerling should use her influence to persuade the coalition that had signed the World Bank letter to back down from their opposition to drilling. Kimerling got the impression that Kennedy felt he knew what was best for Waorani groups despite knowing almost nothing about them.

She refused to give in believing that the decision of whether to negotiate with an oil company or resist should be made in Ecuador and not by her or NRDC. This got her fired from NRDC and it was not an amicable parting she said. The organization tried to get her to sign a nondisparagement agreement barring her from criticizing NRDC or Kennedy and attempted to seize control over the copyright ownership of Amazon Crude which was in the midst of the publication process. She refused to sign the agreement and left the NRDC office in New York feeling as though the nonprofit had taken everything from her but her dignity.

She made phone calls to her Ecuadorian contacts to apologize and explain what had happened. She told the groups that they would have to decide whether to work with NRDC and Conoco. As Kimerling recalled Kennedy’s last words to her before she was fired were: “You don’t want me as your enemy.”

In an interview last week Kennedy denied saying that to Kimerling and told me that in negotiating with Conoco he was acting in his capacity as an attorney and on behalf of his own Indigenous clients who had an interest in stopping colonists from appropriating their land. Conoco had promised to prevent that he said. Kennedy called Kimerling a great advocate said he has “nothing but admiration for her.”

In 1992 Conoco pulled out of Ecuador and a U.S.-based oil company Maxus took over in Block 16 opening up a new oil front in Waorani territories. Conoco did eventually operate in the Ecuadorian Amazon through its subsidiary Burlington Resources from 2006 to 2009 leaving behind $95 million in environmental damage in areas that included ancestral Tagaeri land according to an international arbitration tribunal.

Evangelizing—and Ethnocide

Kimerling entered a period of uncertainty after her parting from NRDC. It had been disappointing to see an organization she respected make what was in her view a deeply flawed decision. She came to see the event as part of a larger problem plaguing some nonprofits. In her telling those organizations do some important work but their need for fundraising and self promotion can distort their priorities. Kimerling told me some organizations “think they know what’s best and make decisions that are disconnected from the desires of grassroots communities even when they claim to speak in the communities’ names.”

She resolved never to be beholden to outside interests and decided the best way to do that was to work independently even if that meant living off of her savings for a period of time. She returned to Ecuador where she partnered with an Indigenous organization to publish a Spanish version of Amazon Crude. In 1993 “Crudo Amazónico” was released and copies of the book made it to rainforest communities as far as across the Peruvian border. Because Kimerling had insisted that photos and graphics be used to help tell the story non-Spanish speakers could understand its essence.

Kimerling personally delivered a copy of the book to a remote village known as Bameno (Bah-Meh-No) home to a Waorani family group the Baihuaeri (Bai-Wade-eee). Kimerling learned that unlike some other Indigenous peoples the Waorani did not identify as one nationality but rather are a constellation of independent hunter-gatherer family groups known for their fierce resistance to outsiders vast knowledge of the forest and unique Wao-terero language. Using their signature hardwood spears they had resisted attempts from rubber tappers and Spanish colonizers to conquer and contact them. Three groups known as the Tagaeri Taromenane and Dugakeri are widely believed to be the last three remaining “uncontacted” Waorani groups.

Kimerling embarked on her two-day journey to Bameno from Coca by first traveling down the Via Auca a 60-mile Texaco-built and named road that ran southward from the city. The road rimmed with pipelines gas flares and oil production sites sliced through ancestral Waorani lands including territory once belonging to the Tagaeri but that now was overrun with colonization. Once the Via Auca ended near the shore of the Shiripuno river Kimerling traveled by motorized canoe down the meandering Shiripuno and then the Cononaco River until she reached Bameno.

There Kimerling met Penti Baihua a young father who by virtue of his ability to speak Spanish had become an intermediary between his Baihuaeri clan and the outside world. Penti with long soft ink-colored hair gentle eyes and a stoic demeanor welcomed Kimerling to the village a collection of homes made from thatched palm leafs and organized around a small landing strip carved into the forest by an oil company. Over three decades he would become her most important Waorani guide and mentor (and much later one of the witnesses she called to testify before the Inter-American court).

As a young boy Penti had lived freely in the forest until he was around the age of 6 or 7 when American missionaries with the Summer Institute of Linguistics forced contact on some members of his Baihuaeri family.

All Waorani peoples had lived isolated in the Ecuadorian Amazon region until 1958 when those missionaries began the first wave of a campaign called “Operation Auca” aimed at contacting and evangelizing the Waorani. The term Auca is a pejorative term meaning “savages.”

The second wave of that campaign took off in the 1970s when Texaco encouraged and helped the missionaries to accelerate and expand their campaign into areas where the company wanted to operate. The aim was to clear Waorani people from their land sever their relationship to it and change their culture so drilling could move forward. “The aim was ethnocidal” Kimerling told me.

There polio and other diseases broke out killing and handicapping dozens of Waorani people. The missionaries told the surviving men women and children that their culture was sinful and the Bible offered salvation. The Baihuaeri had been one of the last family groups contacted by “Operation Auca.” Some of the Baihuaeri had gone to live in the Toñampare settlement and later returned to their ancestral lands while others never left the territory at all. Bameno evolved into the Baihuaeri’s permanent settlement deep in the rainforest though its residents still hew to their ancestral semi-nomadic ways of living by traveling throughout their territories to hunt gather plant and live. As a teenager Penti left Toñampare and returned to the Baihuaeri’s ancestral territory. Kimerling’s brief encounter with Penti left her with a sense that there was something special about him. She had seen and heard how some oil companies were trying to corrupt other young leaders and she heard stories about how oil workers sometimes took Waorani men to brothels and introduced them to alcohol. Kimerling suspected that Penti was different but as she bid goodbye she wasn’t sure if she would ever see him again.

“Information is Power”

Amazon Crude attracted the attention of Cristobol Bonifaz an Ecuadorian expat lawyer and chemical engineer living in Massachusetts. The book inspired him to assemble a team of lawyers to file a class-action lawsuit against Texaco in the United States on behalf of about 30000 colonists and Indigenous people affected by the company’s operations. In October 1992 Bonifaz wrote to Kimerling asking her to join his team of lawyers.

While Kimerling considered the offer friends of hers in Ecuador informed her that Bonifaz’s lawyers while trying to sign up plaintiffs had said Kimerling was working with the team. The news troubled her. Kimerling wanted to see the company held legally accountable for what it had done but felt the lawyers were trading on her good reputation and weren’t being truthful. She declined Bonifaz’s offer.

In November 1993 she was at the Coca headquarters of FCUNAE when someone handed her a copy of a New York Times article. Splashed across the paper was the headline: “Ecuadorian Indians Suing Texaco.” Though she knew it was coming the news still sent a shockwave through her body. The lawsuit she said resonated with locals because it echoed their grievances but people began asking her “Why do strangers speak in our name without authorization without even telling us?”

Kimerling closely followed the developments in the Texaco case as the litigation played out in New York but the crux of her work throughout the 1990s and beyond remained focused on what was happening on the ground in Ecuador. Foreign oil companies including U.S. based Maxus Murphy Oil and Occidental Petroleum were expanding their operations affecting more and more people and parts of the rainforest. Amazon Crude had prompted a rhetorical shift among those companies and Kimerling began to hone in on it.

Locals informed her that when they complained to officials about contamination companies rebuffed the allegations by declaring that they use “cutting edge technology” and abide by “international standards.” Kimerling was well steeped in international Ecuadorian and U.S. environmental laws and so the phrases spurred her to start asking questions because as far as she knew they had no real meaning. She wanted to find out what they meant and how they affected governmental actions.

She focused her research on the U.S. multinational Occidental Petroleum—the same company she had squared off against over hazardous waste at Love Canal. Now Occidental had announced a “sustainable development” initiative to benefit local Indigenous communities. In what Kimerling dubbed the company’s “glossy brochures” Occidental vowed it would operate in an environmentally responsible manner. In six law review articles and a Spanish language book titled “Model or Myth? Cutting-edge Technology and International Standards in the Occidental Oil Fields” Kimerling concluded the company’s promises were more myth than model.

Her topline finding was that the promise of “international standards” had led to Ecuador effectively outsourcing environmental governance to private companies that policed themselves without any independent verification or monitoring. Companies in one of the first instances of greenwashing used the authoritative sounding phrase to placate locals and allay government officials’ concerns while privatizing environmental regulation. Her meticulous research revealed that often the devil was in the details. Buried within hundreds of pages of regulatory documents were permissive phrases like companies “should” endeavor to use best available practices rather than including binding requirements.

“Corporations were saying we’ll voluntarily raise standards beyond what’s required by national law and it gave government officials and the public a false sense of complacency when it wasn’t true” Kimerling told me about her research.

As she was carrying out that investigation local Indigenous groups organized workshops for her to share her findings. Kimerling propelled by the maxim that information is power brought with her stacks of spiral bound packets what she called her “book of sources” to distribute at the meetings. The packets contained copies of the Ecuadorian constitution Occidental’s Environmental Management Plan and other information from her research.

Nowhere was the adage that information is power proving to be more true than in the unfolding Texaco litigation. After Bonifaz filed the case in New York City Texaco initiated closed-door settlement negotiations with the Ecuadorian government over how to resolve its responsibility for the contamination it had caused there. The company agreed to conduct limited remediation of some of its operating sites with Texaco’s consortium partner the state-owned oil company agreeing to take responsibility for the remaining sites. It was an audacious legal maneuver by Texaco—the agreement was forged between two parties that had been responsible for the pollution as well as the forced contact and displacement of Indigenous groups.

To try to get access to information from Texaco Kimerling bought one share of the company’s stock and attended an annual shareholder meeting. There she spoke out about what she said was the speciousness of the cleanup effort. The company’s then-general counsel Deval L. Patrick (who subsequently became the governor of Massachusetts) approached Kimerling after the meeting and told her he was surprised at what she said because Texaco’s consultants had verified the cleanup. He offered to give her a copy of the consultants’ technical remediation report. Kimerling with the help of an independent chemist scrutinized the document concluding the cleanup was mostly “cosmetic.” She also reviewed settlement documents and recognized the name of the Ecuadorian environmental authority who had signed off on the agreement; he had worked for the state oil company at the same time.

Meanwhile Texaco pushed to have Bonifaz’s class action lawsuit dismissed and moved to Ecuador proclaiming that corruption was not a problem there and that the Ecuadorian justice system had strong rule of law.

In 2002 a federal judge in New York Jed Rakoff dismissed the lawsuit ruling that Ecuador was the more appropriate forum to try the case and declaring that the dispute “has nothing to do with the United States.”

Back to Quito

Watching Kimerling sort through the contents of her storage locker in Quito I pointed out that she had amassed a large pile almost entirely composed of documents related to the Texaco case. Looking over at them the corners of her mouth turned downwards and she frowned.

For Kimerling and other legal experts I talked with Judge Rakoff’s decision was the coup de grâce of the Texaco litigation—it was they told me futile to try to successfully sue Texaco in Ecuador at the time given the oil industry’s power there and rampant corruption within the country’s judicial system.

The decision was in line with a larger U.S. Supreme Court shift in jurisprudence that has made it virtually impossible for foreigners to sue American companies in U.S. courts for harm those companies cause abroad.

Kimerling aghast at the decision wrote a 252-page law review article with more than 600 footnotes challenging Judge Rakoff’s reasoning that the case had nothing to do with the United States. In her analysis she pointed out that the judge had accepted Texaco’s post-litigation portrait of itself as merely a contractor of the state. In a chapter entitled “The Two Faces of Texaco” Kimerling cited Texaco’s own documents advertisements and officials’ statements casting itself as a world-class company that was teaching the Ecuadorians the business of oil. There was also the fact that Texaco was the sole operator of the Ecuadorian oil fields until 1990.

For a while she had believed that if the company’s behavior was made public Texaco officials would be pressured and shamed into redressing the suffering it had caused. But this did not happen. That lack of accountability and the expansion of the oil industry has rippled throughout the region and across time the violent consequences of which Kimerling would come to confront over the next two decades.

Coming tomorrow in Part 2 of The Education of Judith Kimerling: After violence erupts in the Amazon Kimerling begins representing a formerly uncontacted girl in what will become the first case before an international court of law involving the rights of uncontacted peoples.

Headliner Old Dominion rocked the Bryce Jordan Center for two hours providing fans with a blend of country rock and pop music.

Morgan opened the performance with her 2021 hit “I Only Date Cowboys” as the sold-out crowd found its seats. She sang “Sugar Daddy” before jumping into renditions of Gwen Stefani’s “Sweet Escape” “Rich Girl” and “Hollaback Girl.”

Morgan thanked the audience at the Bryce Jordan Center for being a part of her first arena tour then sang newly released “Country Girl” before closing with her first top-40 country radio single “If He Wanted To He Would.”

Strobe lights lit up the Jordan Center around 8 p.m. to welcome Rice to the stage. He opened with one of his newer songs “Way Down Yonder” and mentioned it was his first time playing in State College.

Rice moved into his 2013 hit “Ready Set Roll” as his guitarists rocked out on stage. He acknowledged looming finals week for many students at Penn State and reminded everyone to live in the present and celebrate Friday nights.

He took a long sip of a beer and sang “Bad Day to be a Cold Beer” to the pumped up crowd. Many in attendance returned the favor and sang it right back to him. He then performed “Lonely if You Are” and “I Walk Alone” before pulling out a guitar of his own and singing the first major hit he co-wrote with members of Florida Georgia Line: “Cruise.”

Rice then covered one of the most famous country songs ever recorded John Denver’s “Country Roads.” He handed the microphone over to a few fans in the front row to let them take a verse at the familiar melody too. As the singer-songwriter transitioned into a performance of “Oklahoma” a “We Are” chant broke out among fans inside the arena.

Rice continued to entertain the crowd with one of his No. 1 hits “Eyes on You.” He dedicated the next song to all of the dog owners in the crowd as his black lab Jack ran out onto the stage to accompany him. Rice and his best friend sat together as he sang a wholesome rendition of “Bench Seat.” At the conclusion of the tune Jack — donning a Penn State football jersey — ran around and licked the fans sitting by the stage. Rice rocked out to one final song “Drinkin’ Beer. Talkin’ God. Amen” as he hoisted a Nittany Lion helmet and disappeared backstage.

Headliner band Old Dominion took the stage a short wait later and the Bryce Jordan Center quickly became standing-room only. Matthew Ramsey Trevor Rosen Geoff Sprung and Brad Tursi started out guitars in hand with one of their hit songs “Make It Sweet.” Drummer Whit Sellers played behind them.

The next song included the lyric for which the tour was named after “No Hard Feelings.” Lead singer Ramsey broke out a glockenspiel before tossing the mallet into the crowd.

The band then performed “Never Be Sorry” as the lighting panel above the stage lowered showcasing one of the many technological wonders the Bryce Jordan Center has to offer. The group sang “Break Up With Him” which was very well received amongst the fans. Ramsey let the crowd sing one of the choruses and they enthusiastically complied.

Moving over to the corner of the stage the lead vocalist sang “Midnight Mess Around” as he interacted with fans sitting in the front. As an introduction to the next melody “No Such Thing As a Broken Heart” Ramsey encouraged everyone in attendance to get on their feet and sing as loud as they could.

There was then a break in the music as he took a moment to address the audience acknowledging the many signs being held up with song requests.

The band resumed by playing “I Should Have Married You” while Ramsey sang and took selfies with fans. A chill vibe settled over the arena when “Written in the Sand” played as clips of rolling ocean waves adorned the video screens.

Old Dominion then turned to the audience for its next song. A young birthday girl holding up a sign wanted to hear the band play its 2023 song “How Good Is That” and it honored the request. The setlist continued to be determined by the fans as the band played “Paint The Grass Green” next a very rare song for Old Dominion to perform live. Rosen seemingly misplaced his guitar before they played it delaying the show for a few humorous seconds.

The band then broke into one of its popular hits “Snapback” as an exaggerated guitar riff transitioned the melody into that of “Hotel Key.” Rosen played the keyboard for the 2017 tune. A passionate performance of “Memory Lane” the band’s most recent No. 1 song followed as Ramsey Rosen and Tursi joined Sellers on the back part of the stage.

Taking a moment to catch his breath Ramsey enjoyed a sip of beer. After the brief pause he continued by singing “One Man Band” as flashlights lit up the Bryce Jordan Center. Tursi joined Ramsey on the main microphone at center stage.

The next performance was “Song For Another Time” as the crowd waved its arms in the air while four band members moved to the front of the set. A virtual Megan Moroney made an appearance as a recording of her played on the screen when Old Dominion sang “Can’t Break Up Now” a melody co-written by Moroney and the group.

In between songs Ramsey provoked the crowd with a loud “We Are” the crowd responded appropriately with a deafening “Penn State.” Taking another fan request the band played “Said Nobody” followed by a rendition of Kenny Chesney’s “Save It For a Rainy Day.” In the middle of the Chesney cover Ramsey tried to find the loudest side of the arena energizing fans before trying to get them silent…with little luck.

“My Heart Is a Bar” was the last song played before the encore when the band came out for two more songs: “Hawaii” and “I Was on a Boat That Day.” The finale — which featured an accordion performance from Rosen — put the good vibes in the No Bad Vibes tour closing out an epic night of country music at Penn State.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vb2R1c3BvcnRzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMTIvMDIvbWVucy1iYXNrZXRiYWxsLWZhbGxzLXRvLW5vcnRoZWFzdGVybi1zYXR1cmRheS04MS02ONIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Men's Basketball Falls To Northeastern Saturday 81-68,"BOSTON Mass. – Northeastern used a 13-4 spurt over the final 3:36 to hold off a wild Old Dominion comeback for an 81-68 win on Saturday afternoon at Matthews Arena.

“We cannot let China get these chips. Period” she said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley California on Saturday. “We’re going to deny them our most cutting-edge technology.”

To do that Raimondo said the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security which manages export controls for the US needs more funding from Congress.

“I have a $200 million budget. That’s like the cost of a few fighter jets. Come on” she said. “If we’re serious let’s go fund this operation like it needs to be funded.”

Raimondo said American companies will need to adapt to US national security priorities including export controls that her department has placed on semiconductor exports.

“I know there are CEOs of chip companies in this audience who were a little cranky with me when I did that because you’re losing revenue” she said. “Such is life. Protecting our national security matters more than short-term revenue.”

Raimondo called out Nvidia Corp. which designed chips specifically for the Chinese market after the US imposed its initial round of curbs in October 2022.

“If you redesign a chip around a particular cut line that enables them to do AI I’m going to control it the very next day” Raimondo said.

The Commerce Department updated the semiconductor curbs this fall to capture Nvidia’s made-for-China chips — and the company responded by designing three new AI components for the Asian country.

Communication with China can help stabilize ties between the two countries but “on matters of national security we’ve got to be eyes wide open about the threat” she said.

“This is the biggest threat we’ve ever had and we need to meet the moment” she said.

BOSTON — The workforce shortage that has left employers across sectors scrambling to keep operations running in recent years isn't likely to let up ""any time in the rest of anybody's lifetime"" one of the nation's leading economists said Thursday.

""We're going to have a persistent worker shortage for the foreseeable future"" Curtis Dubay chief economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said at a Greater Boston Business Chamber event at WBUR City Space.

Some employers have been waiting for more workers to become available he said but it's time to start shifting to a new strategy of accepting the wide gap between the number of jobs that businesses want to fill and the workers available to fill them.

The labor supply shortage is largely caused by the mass retirement of Baby Boomers Dubay said. ""Succeeding generations after the Baby Boomer generation just weren't big enough.""

There are currently about 3.5 million more job openings than workers available in the country.

No quick solution to Massachusetts labor shortage

Acknowledging that there is no quick solution to the workforce supply issue will be important for Boston businesses as they navigate the labor market Jim Rooney CEO of the Greater Boston Business Chamber said.

""Identifying the labor issues and the worker shortage problem was not unexpected I think what was eye-opening was what Curtis said about it being a longer-term problem"" Rooney said. ""In our minds it's a period of time to get through but given the trends that are driving it and how powerful they are it's going to be much longer term.""

About 10000 Baby Boomers turn 65 and are eligible for retirement every day according to the U.S. Census. By 2030 every member of this large generation will be over retirement age.

With fewer people to fill the roles that the older generation is stepping down from Dubay said the U.S. will need to rely more on immigrants as increasing birth rates is ""not something you can fix with public policy.""

Immigration reform needed to cure labor shortage

Rooney called Boston a ""city driven by immigrants"" and agreed with Dubay's calls for federal immigration reform.

""Our immigration policies are way behind we're not embracing — particularly in this region — what has sustained the economy of Boston really for 400 years"" Rooney said. ""About a third of the workforce in our hospitals are foreign-born. I'm not talking about cafeteria workers cleaners. I'm talking about medical professionals performing surgery in the operating room and treating patients.""

While employers have lamented difficulties running businesses without adequate staff Dubay said Tuesday that workers have benefited.

Economy continues to grow despite recession fears

The economy has continued to grow over the past few years despite economists' frequent predictions that a recession is around the corner.

""Consumers keep spending. That's what's driving growth — they continue to spend. They shouldn't be able to keep spending at such a rate. But the point is they can keep spending because if they want a job or if they want to spend and need a job they can have one"" Dubay said.

Wages are growing as employers try to retain workers which also encourages more spending.

With more opportunities and security for workers Dubay said that even as projections show a slowing economy in 2024 ""I don't think it really matters that much"" if there is a recession.

The U.S. experienced a recession in the first half of 2022 when there were two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth he said. The economist argued that ""no one remembers"" the dip.

""The reason no one remembers that is because during that period jobs expanded spending increased income grew and manufacturing output increased"" Dubay said. ""The point is did it really matter? If all those things that would affect people's daily lives if they're growing and increasing then did we have a recession if no one feels any pain? Does it really matter if it's a recession or not?""

Dubay called this a ""tree falls in the woods recession"" saying that even if the economy slows in 2024 there likely won't be mass layoffs as workers are too valuable to employers in the current landscape.

One of the panelists at Thursday's event Yasmine King of semiconductor manufacturer Analog Devices said her company's number-one challenge is the workforce shortage.

Massachusetts housing costs and living expenses key to retaining attracting workforce

The semiconductor industry is growing at an exponential rate in the U.S.

""We're estimating that by 2030 the industry will need another 115000 jobs in the U.S. and with our current graduation rates of advanced degrees and technical training programs we won't be able to fill half. So that's a significant problem and that's just semiconductors"" King said.

Higher education institutions have been experiencing and continue to prepare for decreased enrollment.

""That's going to be a particular challenge for all higher ed but with Boston being so concentrated it will be a particular challenge here"" Dubay said.

With a shrinking workforce that may not re-inflate any time soon Rooney said on Thursday that Boston and Massachusetts need to shift their strategy to attract the best talent to move to the area and retain those who already live here.

""It's a national issue that is going to have some duration which means that we're in competition for talent with other regions all over the country and they're competing with us"" Rooney said. ""This is a national competition for talent … we need to understand what levers we have to pull to make it attractive to young people to stay here. I think we know what the answer is where we need to lean into — it's housing prices and costs.""

ORCL,Oracle Corporation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVzdG9wZWRpYS5jb20vY2hhaW5saW5rLWxpbmstZGVmaW5pdGlvbi01MjE3NTU50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chainlink: What It Is and How It Works,"What Is Chainlink?

Chainlink (LINK) is a cryptocurrency and technology platform that enables non-blockchain enterprises to securely connect with blockchain platforms. Chainlink is middleware that connects blockchain-based smart contracts with external data such as baseball scores or stock prices. Chainlink's LINK currency pays Chainlink network operators and collateralizes the network's smart contract agreements.

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network or blockchain abstraction layer. Chainlink uses blockchain technology to securely enable computations on- and off-chain supporting what it calls hybrid smart contracts and its cross-chain interoperability protocol.



The Chainlink blockchain is hosted on the Ethereum platform which uses the proof-of-stake operating protocol. In addition Chainlink is an open-source blockchain project meaning anyone can view the project's code and contribute.

Key Takeaways Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that connects blockchains with off-chain data.

Chainlink uses hybrid smart contracts to integrate on-chain code and off-chain data infrastructure.

Chainlink tokens—called LINK—serve as currency to pay Chainlink network operators for retrieving and preparing off-chain data and performing computations.

Understanding Chainlink

The Chainlink blockchain can support the secure sharing of inputs outputs and computations. Some features of Chainlink include:

Supporting decentralized data feeds : Data from many sources can be securely collected and processed for hybrid smart contracts.

: Data from many sources can be securely collected and processed for hybrid smart contracts. Providing verifiable sources of randomness : Applications such as games that require cryptographically secured randomness can use Chainlink.

: Applications such as games that require cryptographically secured randomness can use Chainlink. Enabling automation : Chainlink smart contracts can automate critical functions and event-driven tasks for enterprises.

: Chainlink smart contracts can automate critical functions and event-driven tasks for enterprises. Supporting cross-blockchain interoperability: Chainlink can connect blockchain platforms to support the exchange of messages tokens and specific actions.

Chainlink is a blockchain-based decentralized oracle network that was launched in 2017. Oracles are networking tools that connect blockchains to external systems thereby allowing smart contracts to execute based on inputs and outputs originating from the blockchain.

Though traditional oracles are centralized Chainlink decentralizes the process of moving data on and off blockchains through ""hybrid smart contracts."" LINK tokens are used to reward Chainlink network operators for retrieving data from off-chain feeds formatting data into accessible formats and performing off-chain computations.

The Chainlink decentralized oracle network is a system of nodes that adhere to set protocols. Node operators are required to stake—lock a specific number of—their LINK tokens. Node operators set their own fees based on demand for the off-chain resource they provide.

Chainlink node operators with the largest stakes are the best positioned to earn LINK rewards.

Because Chainlink allows blockchains to exchange data with off-chain systems in a decentralized and tamper-resistant way the Chainlink oracle network has many use cases. Chainlink has been used to fairly distribute non-fungible tokens (NFTs) gamify personal savings and facilitate recalibrations of cryptocurrency token supplies among other applications.

Chainlink was created by Sergey Nazarov and Steve Ellis who authored a 2017 white paper with Ari Juels. The network launched in 2019. LINK is an ERC-20 token meaning that it is compatible with other currencies and smart contracts supported by the Ethereum platform.



How Does Chainlink Differ From Ethereum?

The Chainlink network is in some ways a complement to the Ethereum network and other blockchains. Chainlink can facilitate secure communications between Ethereum projects and various off-chain data. Because Chainlink's LINK token is built on the Ethereum platform LINK is compliant with the Ethereum platform's protocols.

Ethereum tokens can be used to spend on purchases facilitate smart contracts and pay validators for operating the Ethereum network. Chainlink tokens have only a single use case which is to pay node operators in the Chainlink network.

The proof-of-stake mechanism rewards network participants for placing a freeze on the ETH they ""stake"" or put up as collateral for the chance to earn rewards.

Goals of Chainlink

Chainlink aims to continue to grow by expanding its support for blockchain environments and facilitating new use cases for hybrid smart contracts. Because significant stores of data and records are not yet maintained within blockchains Chainlink may have countless opportunities to connect blockchain networks with off-chain information.

In 2021 the Chainlink network secured more than $75 billion of value as it grew to include over 1000 projects. Chainlink has a maximum supply of 1 billion tokens of which about 557 million have been issued (as of December 2023).

What Can I Buy With LINK? LINK cryptocurrency is used to incentivize Chainlink node operators rather than being designed for everyday purchases. These network participants tasked with securely transferring data to and from blockchains are paid in LINK.

Why Is Chainlink Popular? The Chainlink decentralized oracle can connect many types of data with various blockchains creating many potential applications for Chainlink. Chainlink could help to integrate blockchain technology with many industries and business functions.

Is Chainlink Made by Oracle? Oracle Corp. (ORCL) is a computer technology company specializing in database management. Chainlink is not affiliated with Oracle Corp. Chainlink refers to itself as a decentralized oracle network with the ""oracle"" being a broad-based group of intermediaries that connect blockchains with off-chain information systems.

The Bottom Line

Chainlink is a blockchain project designed to connect different networks and protocols together through oracles. Oracles are networking tools that allow cross-network communication. The project's goal is to provide support for all blockchains facilitating data movement globally between blockchains.

To see more stocks that made our list you can skip ahead and take a look at the 5 best cloud stocks to buy now.

Should you invest in cloud computing?

If you don't give it much thought what is the latest tech trend that comes to your mind. Your answer is probably going to be Artificial Intelligence. AI seems to have taken the world by storm and is quickly making its way disrupting pretty much every aspect of our lives. Therefore it's probably a good idea to look into AI companies as a potential investment opportunity. If you agree then here's a list of best artificial intelligence stocks to buy according to hedge funds.

However we cannot talk about AI as a standalone industry it relies on other technologies and one in particular that deserves some attention is cloud computing. Cloud computing is one of the most important technologies that provide the massive processing power that any AI model needs to operate properly. Cloud of course in its turn relies on chips and other hardware which rely on various materials that need to be extracted and processed and so on but let's not get sidetracked.

Besides AI cloud computing is also very relevant in other important areas of our lives that have been picking up speed recently such as Internet of Things. Pretty much any process that does or will involve processing vast amounts or data quickly will be reliant on cloud computing. In addition more and more businesses choose to move their operations into the cloud to improve their efficiency. As the pandemic hit the trend of switching over to cloud has accelerated as remote work required employees being able to access company data and platforms quickly over the Internet. As many businesses noticed that remote work did not harm (and in many cases even improved) their operations they chose to continue the Work from Home ""tradition"" and cloud computing will help them stay on this path.

All in all that's why some estimates such as this one by Fortune Business Insights predict that cloud computing market will reach over $2.0 trillion by 2030 from roughly $569 billion.

Therefore the short answer to the above question is yes you definitely should consider investing in cloud stocks and we will show you what are the best cloud stocks to buy now according to smart money investors.

(NASDAQ:PANW) Worth Looking At Closely?,"Palo Alto Networks Inc. (NASDAQ:PANW) led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Palo Alto Networks’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.

Check out our latest analysis for Palo Alto Networks

What's The Opportunity In Palo Alto Networks?

Good news investors! Palo Alto Networks is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation the intrinsic value for the stock is $419.03 which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that Palo Alto Networks’s share price is quite volatile which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.

Can we expect growth from Palo Alto Networks?

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Palo Alto Networks' earnings over the next few years are expected to double indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows feeding into a higher share value.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? Since PANW is currently undervalued it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However there are also other factors such as financial health to consider which could explain the current undervaluation.

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on PANW for a while now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet which means it’s not too late to buy PANW. But before you make any investment decisions consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet in order to make a well-informed buy.

So while earnings quality is important it's equally important to consider the risks facing Palo Alto Networks at this point in time. While conducting our analysis we found that Palo Alto Networks has 1 warning sign and it would be unwise to ignore this.

Investors have pushed Microsoft (MSFT 0.23%) stock to new highs in recent weeks. The tech giant's share price performance is trouncing the wider market having soared nearly 60% this year. By comparison the Nasdaq Composite gained 36%.

Some investors are concerned that this rally has made Microsoft a less compelling growth stock. It's approaching $3 trillion in market capitalization after all and Wall Street is well aware of its many sales catalysts ahead. These include artificial intelligence (AI) and the rising demand for video games and cybersecurity software in the years to come.

If you'd like exposure to some of these industries but are turned off by Microsoft's elevated valuation there are some good alternatives to consider. Read on for reasons to buy Adobe (ADBE -0.82%) and Palo Alto Networks (PANW -0.60%) instead.

Adobe is cashing in on AI

Adobe stock is riding on a wave of enthusiasm about generative AI but it isn't just hype that's elevating investor sentiment in 2023. The software giant is already capitalizing on AI tech that's made its way into products like Photoshop and Premiere Pro. In mid-September Adobe revealed that higher demand across its portfolio has helped push profit to $4.9 billion in the first half of 2023 up from $4.5 billion a year earlier.

Adobe's focus on content creation positions it well to take full advantage of the rising value that AI is delivering. You can see evidence of that excitement in the fact that people have generated 2 billion images using its new Firefly software in just the first six months following its release. Subscription services are rising too contributing to impressive cash-flow trends.

The company is valued at a premium to Microsoft. But growth-stock investors see good reasons to like shares at the current valuation of 15x sales compared to Microsoft's price-to-sales ratio (P/S) of 13. Its smaller sales footprint and greater focus on creative content could make Adobe a huge winner in the next era of computing tech.

Palo Alto Networks can keep its momentum

Microsoft offers cybersecurity protection as part of its huge services platform but investors might earn better returns from owning Palo Alto Networks over the next several years. Sure investors were a bit disappointed with the company's earnings update in late November which showed slowing billings trends.

Yet sales were up a healthy 20% in the Q3 period and are on track to rise at nearly the same pace for the full year. Most Wall Street pros are looking for Microsoft to grow at 4% this fiscal year by contrast.

An investment in Palo Alto Networks doesn't offer nearly the same level of diversity and safety that comes along with Microsoft's massive global sales base. You don't get a dividend from owning this cybersecurity business either.

Still investors who value growth will love Palo Alto Networks' expanding market share and its healthy market share in a competitive niche. Management is determined to keep boosting profitability as well building on the excellent momentum that shareholders saw here last year.

As is the case with Adobe you'll pay a higher premium to own Palo Alto right now as compared to late 2022. But for roughly the same price-to-sales valuation as Microsoft you'll get exposure to a leading software-as-a-service provider in an industry that's likely to see fantastic growth over the next several years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGFja2VybmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi9hZ2VudC1yYWNvb24tYmFja2Rvb3ItdGFyZ2V0cy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Agent Racoon Backdoor Targets Organizations in Middle East Africa and U.S.,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://thehackernews.com/2023/12/agent-racoon-backdoor-targets.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGFja2VybmV3cy5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi9hZ2VudC1yYWNvb24tYmFja2Rvb3ItdGFyZ2V0cy5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vam9icy9mcmVzaGVyL2lpdC1raGFyYWdwdXItaWl0LWJodS12YXJhbmFzaS1iYWctbWVnYS1vZmZlcnMtb24tZmlyc3QtZGF5LW9mLXBsYWNlbWVudHMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvMTA1NjgyMjY4LmNtc9IBkAFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vam9icy9mcmVzaGVyL2lpdC1raGFyYWdwdXItaWl0LWJodS12YXJhbmFzaS1iYWctbWVnYS1vZmZlcnMtb24tZmlyc3QtZGF5LW9mLXBsYWNlbWVudHMvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93LzEwNTY4MjI2OC5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IIT Kharagpur IIT (BHU) together bag close to 1240 offers including PPOs by end of Day 1 of final place,BENGALURU: IIT Kharagpur bagged more than 700 offers including pre-placement offers (PPOs) at the end of the first day of the final placement drive while IIT-BHU had 537 offers including PPOs.More than 61 companies made offers at IIT Kharagpur for software analytics finance–banking consulting and core engineering roles.

The Nasdaq-100 technology index plunged into bear territory in 2022 ending the year with a 33% loss. However historical data going back to its inception in 1986 suggests consecutive losing years are very rare with just one occurrence during the dot-com tech bust from 2000 to 2002. In fact down years are usually followed immediately by monster gains.

True to form the Nasdaq-100 bounced back in 2023 and is currently sitting on a whopping 46% return. Investors might be pleased to know that also bodes very well for 2024.

According to historical data bounce-back years are always followed by another positive year for the Nasdaq-100. There have been four such occurrences dating back to 1986 with an average gain of 21.5%.

If history does repeat here are five stocks investors will want in their portfolios in 2024.

1. Microsoft

Microsoft (MSFT 0.20%) stock is on track to end 2023 near an all-time high. The company is having one of the most transformative years in its history as it continues to weave artificial intelligence (AI) into its entire product portfolio.

Microsoft kicked off 2023 with a $10 billion investment in ChatGPT developer OpenAI and that technology is now embedded in the Windows operating system the 365 document suite the Edge internet browser the Bing search engine and the Azure cloud platform. It's one of very few companies already monetizing AI with over 18000 business customers now accessing OpenAI's latest GPT-4 model on Azure to develop their own AI applications.

But this is just the beginning. Next year Microsoft will make its brand-new AI data center chips available to Azure customers adding yet another point of differentiation from its cloud competitors. Plus investors should expect more AI-powered software products from the company as it discovers new ways to apply the technology. Overall 2024 could be one of Microsoft's biggest years ever.

2. Uber Technologies

Investors in Uber Technologies (UBER -1.62%) stock are sitting pretty this year because it has more than doubled. The company's mobility (ride hailing) business has roared back to life following a long recovery from pandemic-related restrictions and it has become the growth engine behind the entire organization once again.

Uber is coming off a number of records in its recent third quarter of 2023. Its gross bookings hit an all-time high of $35.3 billion as did its revenue which came in at $9.3 billion. The company also had 142 million monthly active customers which was another record. Mobility led the charge with bookings growing by 30% year over year compared to just 16% growth in its food delivery segment.

But Uber is on the cusp of a significant long-term opportunity and 2024 could mark an inflection point. The company has signed a series of agreements with leading developers of autonomous self-driving vehicles. Customers can already book an autonomous ride on Uber in Phoenix Arizona thanks to its partnership with Alphabet's self-driving vehicle subsidiary Waymo.

Considering drivers are Uber's largest cost by a wide margin autonomous vehicles could transform the company's economics. Investors should pay close attention to its progress on this front in 2024 because it could send Uber stock soaring.

3. Palo Alto Networks

Cybersecurity plays an integral role in modern organizations especially those relying on cloud computing to run their operations online. Palo Alto Networks (PANW -0.71%) is an industry leader and unlike most of its peers its stock is set to end 2023 at a record level.

Palo Alto is using advanced technologies like AI to automate threat detection and incident response. The company says 93% of security operations centers within organizations still rely on manual human-led processes which means 23% of security alerts are left uninvestigated. That creates unacceptable vulnerabilities.

Palo Alto's new Cortex XSIAM security operations platform uses AI to mitigate those risks by delivering an automation-first approach. One customer said XSIAM reduced its mean time to repair (MTTR) to just 16 minutes (from three days) following an incident. That's an increase in efficiency of 270 times. The platform only launched a year ago yet it has already amassed over $1 billion in bookings.

But that's just one product among more than 35 Palo Alto has embedded with AI across its cloud security network security and security operations segments. As the frequency of cybersecurity incidents continues to increase Palo Alto is a great stock for investors to own.

4. Axcelis Technologies

Semiconductor companies outside of the AI space have struggled this year as consumers cut back on big-ticket purchases of computers and devices. But Axcelis Technologies (ACLS 1.33%) has bucked that industry trend. The semiconductor service company produces ion implantation equipment which is a crucial component of the chip fabrication process.

Through the first nine months of 2023 Axcelis grew its revenue by 25% year over year to $820.3 million. Its profitability also surged with its earnings per share growing by 41% to $5.28 over the same period. The company said it's experiencing strong demand for its Purion line of equipment which is popular among electric vehicle manufacturers for its ability to produce silicon carbide power devices. That chemistry is far more efficient than silicon-based hardware which leads to longer battery life and faster charging times.

As a semiconductor service company Axcelis is insulated from short-term shifts in the chip industry because its customers often plan their capital expenditures years in advance. If they want to expand their production capacity in the future they often begin ordering equipment ahead of time. As a result Axcelis will carry a whopping $1.2 billion order backlog into 2024 which should support another year of strong growth.

Moreover Axcelis stock trades at a bargain price to earnings (P/E) ratio of just 17.7 right now. That's 38% cheaper than the Nasdaq-100 which trades at a P/E ratio of 28.9 so there's no time like the present to buy in.

5. Nvidia

Finally can a technology investor's portfolio really be complete without Nvidia (NVDA 0.34%)? Its stock has soared 226% this year as the company ascended to the top of the AI industry thanks to its powerful data center graphics chips (GPUs). That hardware remains in high demand from leading tech giants like Microsoft Amazon and Alphabet who are racing to offer their cloud customers sufficient computing power to develop their own AI applications.

Nvidia just reported its financial results for the fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29). Through the first three quarters of the year the company generated $29.1 billion in data center revenue which was a whopping 155% increase compared to the same period in fiscal 2023. But Nvidia is just getting warmed up because its CEO Jensen Huang says there is $1 trillion worth of existing data center infrastructure that needs upgrading to support accelerated computing and AI.

Nvidia is the undisputed leader in this space right now. The company will be very hard to unseat because it has built an entire ecosystem around its chips including the CUDA software platform developers use to build applications on top of its GPUs. CUDA can't be used with chips from any other manufacturer so if a customer wants to move away from Nvidia's hardware they also have to abandon the software -- which is unlikely given developers have grown so comfortable using it.

Nvidia's leading H100 data center GPU remains in high demand. But the company just launched the new H200 which can double the inference speed of the H100. It means developers can train large language models far more quickly. Plus it consumes 50% less power so it's a huge cost saver for data center operators. The new chip should buoy Nvidia's growth in the new year but over the longer term this could become the largest company in the world."

The streamer also unveiled the first-look teaser trailer during its panel today at CCXP in São Paolo Brazil with cast members Pablo Schreiber and Joseph Morgan along with showrunner David Wiener and executive producer Kiki Wolfkill.

In season two Master Chief John-117 leads his team of elite Spartans against the alien threat known as the Covenant. In the wake of a shocking event on a desolate planet John cannot shake the feeling that his war is about to change and risks everything to prove what no one else will believe – that the Covenant are preparing to attack humanity’s greatest stronghold. With the galaxy on the brink John embarks on a journey to find the key to humankind’s salvation or its extinction — the Halo.

Led by showrunner and executive producer David Wiener (Brave New World) the series takes place in the universe that first debuted in 2001 with the launch of Xbox’s first Halo game. Dramatizing an epic 26th-century conflict between humanity and an alien threat known as the Covenant Halo the series weaves deeply drawn personal stories with action adventure and a richly imagined vision of the future.

Halo stars Pablo Schreiber (American Gods) as Master Chief Spartan-117 and Natascha McElhone (Californication) as Dr. Halsey who also both serve as producers this season. Additional returning cast members include Jen Taylor (Halo game series RWBY) as Cortana Bokeem Woodbine (Fargo) Shabana Azmi (Fire) Natasha Culzac (The Witcher) Olive Gray (Half Moon Investigations) Yerin Ha (Reef Break) Bentley Kalu (Avengers: Age of Ultron) Kate Kennedy (Catastrophe) Charlie Murphy (Peaky Blinders) and Danny Sapani (Penny Dreadful).

New additions to the cast this season include Joseph Morgan (Vampire Diaries The Originals) and Cristina Rodlo (No One Gets Out of Here Alive The Homeless World Cup). Morgan joins the series as James Ackerson a formidable intelligence operative who has spent his career climbing the ranks of the UNSC’s secretive Office of Naval Intelligence. Rodlo is Talia Perez a corporal specializing in linguistics for a UNSC Marine Corps communications unit and a relatively new recruit who has yet to see any real combat. Returning from season one Laera (Fiona O’Shaughnessy) is Soren’s confidant wife and partner in crime. Soren and Laera’s son Kessler (Tylan Bailey) has had a relatively peaceful if unusual childhood growing up on the Rubble.

Halo is produced by Showtime in association with 343 Industries and Amblin Television. Season 2 is executive produced by David Wiener alongside Steven Spielberg Darryl Frank and Justin Falvey for Amblin Television. Kiki Wolfkill serves as executive producer for Xbox/343 Industries with Otto Bathurst and Toby Leslie for One Big Picture and Gian Paolo Varani. The series is distributed internationally by Paramount Global Content Distribution.

The bundle culture in the recent OTT world is overtaking the market with more competitors collaborating. This time Apple TV and Paramount find themselves in the same war.

Over time Paramount has established itself as one of the elite distributors. Apple TV is emerging as one of the most promising names especially with its sports wing and recent content streaming showcasing its potential.

Amidst the price hikes of all OTT platforms the bundle deal is precisely what fans will ask for.

Paramount Global’s shares increased in premarket trading following talks with Apple about a bundled subscription for Paramount+ and AppleTV+. The potential bundle aims for a cost-effective option considering Paramount+’s ad-free tier at $11.99 and a possible price hike while AppleTV+ is priced at $9.99.

However in the bundled market they won’t be alone as competitors like Disney+ Hulu and ESPN+ are still attempting to crack the market. Max is also looking for a better half to fight the battle.

Though as of now both companies have refrained from commenting on the speculations The Wall Street Journal reports that it is nothing but a matter of time.",,,,,,

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander of the Oklahoma City Thunder goes up for a layup during the second half against the Los Angeles Lakers at the Paycom Center on November 30 2023 in Oklahoma City Oklahoma.

Los Angeles — Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored 33 points to propel the Oklahoma City Thunder to a 133-110 NBA victory over LeBron James and the weary Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday.

Gilgeous-Alexander connected on 11 of 18 shots from the field and made all 10 of his free throws.

Jalen Williams scored 21 points and rookie center Chet Holmgren added 18 for the Thunder who had seven players in double figures.

Chet Holmgren and Victor Wembanyama have been compared to each other after every game played this season. And while Wemby had the hype in the contest initially Holmgren has come out in the front over the last couple of weeks.

With the OKC Thunder also having the third-best record in the West as compared to the Spurs’ worst record in the conference many have now skipped over to Chet’s side in this race. However Gilbert Arenas for one doesn’t seem to be very convinced. The former NBA man went a long way to explain why Wembanyama is the far better athlete during his recent appearance on ‘Gil’s Arena’ as seen in Josian Johnson’s X post.

“This is how you look at the situation. One is 19 one is 21. What did the 21-year-old look like when he was at 19 years old? I can tell you this he wasn’t in the NBA averaging 19 [points per contest]”

Arenas then went on to make the argument that the reason Chet is the better of the two players right now is because he is older and has had more time with NBA coaches.

“At 21 we see what Chet looks like. What the f**k is Wemby gonna look like at 21?!… That is who you’re going to judge Chet against. You’re judging him [Wemby] against an older player now at the same age when Wemby gets to 21 who is he going to be? Is he going to be averaging 17 and 10? Or is he going to be averaging about 25-26 and 12?”

It is clear that Gilbert Arenas loves what he has seen from Victor Wembanyama already. And indeed two years can make a big difference in the NBA.

That said growth hasn’t always been strictly linear amongst NBA athletes. Victor Wembanyama arguably has the potential to be one the greatest of all time. But whether or not he can achieve it only time will tell.

Chet Holmgren is still a rookie too

It may be a technicality but Chet Holmgren is still a rookie too one that has returned from a major foot injury. The reason he has continued to be deemed a rookie by the NBA is that he missed all of his actual rookie year rehabbing his foot. And since he played no official games during this stretch he qualified to be labeled as a rookie during this season as well.

That said Holmgren does have a leg up on Victor Wembanyama. Before during and after his rehab process Chet had the privilege of being coached by NBA-level coaches to get to the next level as soon as possible. And with the young man already averaging a very efficient 17.9 points 7.8 rebounds and 2.6 assists it seems that this time has well and truly panned out.

However Wembanyama won’t be left in the dust for too long. While his numbers are far more inefficient he is already averaging 19.3 points 9.7 rebounds and 2.6 assists.

With both rookies doing very well to show themselves off to the world the rookie of the year race will likely remain a toss-up until the very finish line. Until that point arrives this is sure to be an absolute treat for fans of the league.",,,,,,

Shares of PayPal Holdings (PYPL 1.22%) gained 11% in November according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Investors were impressed with the new CEO's first earnings report and it also benefited from an overall market rally.

Still the fintech to beat

PayPal is the leader in digital payment processing and peer-to-peer payments even though it's been slowing down since its highs early in the pandemic. It processed nearly $388 billion in volume in the 2023 third quarter a 15% increase over last year and it has 428 million active accounts.

Revenue increased 9% on a currency neutral basis over last year and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) increased from $1.08 last year to $1.30 this year in the third quarter both ahead of management's guidance. Management raised guidance for full-year EPS to increase 21% to $4.98.

These were positive signs for a company that has been losing steam over the past two years. Critics say that PayPal has lost its edge and that slowing growth and pressured profits indicate that it has fumbled with no clear way forward. There are many new smaller fintechs that have invaded its territory and are resonating with customers offering improved digital financial services.

A new CEO and a new growth strategy

This was the first report under new CEO Alex Chriss who took over for Dan Schulman at the end of September. He brings a fresh approach to PayPal as it looks for new direction and with two months on the job he has demonstrated the ability to bring the company into its next iteration.

Something that was already in the works is the new focus on active accounts as opposed to creating any new accounts. Active accounts have been steadily decreasing over the past few quarters which could be reason for alarm.

Management explained that it was investing in active accounts while letting go of inactive accounts to make its resources work better and so far that's playing out. Transactions per active account increased 13% over last year in the trailing 12 months.

A few years ago PayPal was working to bring out what it called a Super App with an all-under-one-roof approach to digital financial services. Most of that has come to fruition but the flip side of that was that competitors introduced popular individual services. PayPal is now improving specific services to better compete in fintech.

It's also been struggling through an overall retail rut with many retailers (and specifically e-commerce retailers) dealing with the fallout of inflation combined with a return to physical stores. Both of these trends look like they're reversing and PayPal is well positioned to benefit.

PayPal stock is still down about 80% from its highs in 2021 and now looks like a great time to buy shares.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAyL2JldHRlci1zdG9jay10by1idXktcGF5cGFsLXN0b2NrLXZzLWJsb2NrLXN0b2NrL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Better Stock to Buy: PayPal Stock vs. Block Stock,Parkev Tatevosian CFA has positions in PayPal.

Quick Thoughts

Target runs this deal every year and regular Target shoppers always get excited about the chance to save up to $50. You can load these gift cards to your Target wallet and use them on your phone to pay in-store making them easy to use over time. Many people will find this worthwhile for personal use particularly those who shop regularly at Target and/or are trying to ahem hit the target for minimum spend on a new credit card welcome offer. Note that you’ll need to load the coupon to Target circle before buying the gift cards.

If you don’t shop at Target regularly this could still be useful depending on your resale avenues. I wouldn’t expect to turn much of a profit but for many the chance to break even on a decent chunk of spend is appealing.

We don’t recommend trying to game this and exceed the per-customer limit. A few years ago there were reports from people whose gift cards were zeroed out days after the promotion which would be a huge headache.

There are several worthwhile cards to use. Target is one of the Q4 5% categories for the Discover It and the Chase Freedom cards have PayPal as a 5x category as well so if you used one via PayPal you’d trigger it. Another good option would be the U.S.Bank Altitude Reserve since that card earns 3x on in-person mobile wallet payments. If you used that with something like Google Pay or Apple Pay you would earn 3x which is worth 4.5% back towards travel. Outside of that just use your best “everywhere else” card.",,,

Stocks have rallied this year but one of the world's most famous pharma companies didn't join the party. Pfizer (PFE -0.24%) known for its billion-dollar coronavirus products -- the vaccine Comirnaty and the treatment Paxlovid -- saw its shares drop about 40%.

The declines came for two reasons. First investors worried about sales of Pfizer's coronavirus products in a post-pandemic world. And second some of Pfizer's older blockbusters face patent expirations in the coming years. All of this means revenue is set to fall at least in the near term. And that doesn't delight investors.

At the same time it's important to take a look at the complete picture. This includes Pfizer's newer programs and what they may deliver in the future as well as the company's valuation today. Is Pfizer a buy right now -- or a stock to avoid? Let's find out.

Pfizer's $100 billion in revenue

First let's look at the bad news. Pfizer's vaccine Comirnaty and its treatment Paxlovid are no longer the revenue drivers they were last year when they helped Pfizer generate record revenue of more than $100 billion. Recently Pfizer cut this year's revenue guidance to a range of $58 billion to $61 billion due to decreased demand for coronavirus products.

Meanwhile Pfizer faces patent expirations on certain top products later this decade such as the blood thinner Eliquis and oncology drug Ibrance. Pfizer has even predicted that losses of exclusivity will cut $17 billion from its revenue from 2025 to 2030.

Before moving on to the brighter news we should consider this: The challenges Pfizer faces today are normal parts of the pharmaceutical business. Coronavirus product sales reached extremely high levels during a pandemic situation -- a unique time. It's normal for those products to bring in lower sales once infection risks have declined.

And the positive news for Pfizer here is that demand hasn't completely disappeared. Like influenza COVID-19 represents an opportunity for annual vaccination and therefore recurrent revenue well into the future.

As for patent expiration this too is something all pharma companies face at a certain point. So we shouldn't focus on the losses of exclusivity but instead on what Pfizer is doing to compensate and grow. And here begins our good news.

The biggest streak of product launches ever

Pfizer is on track to complete its biggest streak of product launches ever. The company plans to release 19 new products or indications in 18 months and so far it's completed 13 of those. It expects these to provide $20 billion in revenue by 2030.

Pfizer also has been working hard on external growth and through business deals it aims to deliver an additional $25 billion in revenue by that time. Most of this is through acquisitions that already have been completed as well as its agreement to buy oncology specialist Seagen. Pfizer expects the Seagen deal to close by early next year.

The pharma giant is focused on growth: expanding its work in the area of mRNA therapeutics for example. Right now it's shepherding both stand-alone mRNA flu and combined coronavirus/flu vaccine candidates through late-stage trials.

Pfizer also is delivering growth in key leadership areas such as pneumococcal vaccination; in the recent quarter it had a 95% share of the adult market with Prevnar 20. The approval this year of Prevnar 20 in the U.S. pediatric market and ongoing demand in the adult market helped the product and its earlier version Prevnar 13 generate double-digit revenue growth in the quarter.

So we can count on revenue growth from some current products as well as contributions from new launches in the coming years.

Pfizer's annual dividend

And we shouldn't forget that Pfizer also pays an annual dividend of $1.64 per share which currently yields over 5.4% -- far surpassing the yield of the S&P 500 index. This means you can count on Pfizer for passive income even during times of share-price weakness.

Now let's get back to our question. Trading for 19 times forward earnings estimates is Pfizer a buy? Of course the pharma giant isn't in high-growth mode right now and the company has reached a turning point that won't necessarily be 100% rosy. Sales of many key products are on the decline.

But this is when it's important to think long-term. If we imagine what Pfizer will look like a few years down the road the picture looks much brighter thanks to the steps the company is taking today. That's why right now Pfizer stock looks very reasonably priced -- and would make a great addition to any long-term healthcare portfolio.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMDIvcGZpemVyLXdlaWdodC1sb3NzLXBpbGwtam9pbnMtbGlzdC1vZi1vYmVzaXR5LWRydWctZmxvcHMuaHRtbNIBYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDIzLzEyLzAyL3BmaXplci13ZWlnaHQtbG9zcy1waWxsLWpvaW5zLWxpc3Qtb2Ytb2Jlc2l0eS1kcnVnLWZsb3BzLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pfizer's twice-daily weight loss pill joins a long list of obesity drug flops,"In this article PFE Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT

Sopa Images | Lightrocket | Getty Images

Pfizer' s twice-daily version of its experimental weight loss pill has now joined a long list of other scrapped drugs that aimed to treat obesity but came with unintended consequences. The drugmaker on Friday said it will stop developing the twice-daily treatment danuglipron after obese patients taking the drug lost significant weight but experienced high rates of adverse side effects in a midstage clinical trial. Pfizer noted that it will release data on a once-daily version of the pill next year which will ""inform the path forward."" The announcement came six months after Pfizer scrapped a different once-daily pill in June citing elevated liver enzymes. Pfizer's move to drop two obesity drug candidates in just a few months demonstrates how difficult it is to develop an effective safe and tolerable treatment for losing weight even after recent breakthrough medications entered the space. That includes Novo Nordisk 's Wegovy and diabetes treatment Ozempic as well as Eli Lilly 's diabetes drug Mounjaro. They have all skyrocketed in popularity — and slipped into shortages — over the last year for safely and successfully causing significant weight loss. An estimated 40% of U.S. adults are obese making those drugs the pharmaceutical industry's newest cash cow. But before the current weight loss industry gold rush the path to treating obesity was strewn with failures dating back decades. The main reason many experimental treatments were scrapped by drugmakers rejected by U.S. regulators or eventually pulled from the market were unintended side effects including elevated liver enzymes cancer risks cardiovascular risks and serious psychiatric problems such as suicide.

Eisai's lorcaserin

One of the most recent casualties among experimental obesity drugs is Japanese drugmaker Eisai' s lorcaserin which was removed from the market in 2020 due to causing an increased risk of cancer in patients. The Food and Drug Administration greenlit lorcaserin in 2012 based on several clinical trials but required Eisai to conduct a larger and longer study on the drug after the approval. That study on about 12000 patients over five years found that more people taking lorcaserin were diagnosed with cancer compared with those taking a placebo which led the FDA to pull the drug from the market. Lorcaserin marketed under the brand name Belviq didn't appear to gain much traction while it was commercially available. In its full-year 2019 earnings Eisai reported that Lorcaserin had sales of $28.1 million in the U.S. for the year. Global sales of the drug were about $42 million. Eisai's total sales for the year were roughly $4.42 billion.

Sanofi's rimonabant

An obesity drug called rimonabant from Sanofi and Aventis was withdrawn from all markets in 2008 due to the risk of serious psychiatric problems including suicide. Notably the treatment never won approval in the U.S. because a panel of experts to the FDA rejected the drug amid fears that it may cause suicidal thoughts. But European regulators approved rimonabant marketed under the name Acomplia in 2006 based on extensive clinical trials. Two years later European regulators recommended the suspension of rimonabant after one of its committees determined that the risks of the treatment — particularly psychiatric issues — outweighed its benefits. The treatment suppressed appetite by blocking the receptor of cannabinoid substances in the brain which plays an important role in regulating the body's food intake and metabolism. Due to rimonabant's limited time on the market and failure to win U.S. approval the drug never reached Sanofi's lofty projection that it would eventually generate $3 billion a year or more.

(AP Photo/Stew Milne)

Pfizer Inc. is starting to roll out the pharmaceutical company’s biggest round of layoffs since 2009 and its Groton laboratories are not immune.

Of course New York-based Pfizer these days never comes out and says how many layoffs will occur in Groton so we are left to guess at the numbers. But in October Pfizer said financial cuts company-wide would amount to $3.5 billion by the end of next year and in a follow-up third-quarter conference call officials made it sound like many of those reductions would be aimed at facilities involved in COVID-19 vaccine development and production.

“The COVID part is going to be the biggest part” Albert Bourla Pfizer’s chairman and chief executive officer said in the Halloween conference call in response to a question about where cuts will be targeted.

Of course Pfizer’s Groton labs were directly involved in much of the company’s COVID vaccine development. At one point in March 2021 Groton site leader John Burkhardt told me that about 200 scientists were working on developing the initial Pfizer COVID vaccine out of about 2600 direct employees there.

The labs were involved in molecular-level studies of the world’s first mRNA vaccine as well as the planning designing and executing of drug trials and analysis of the results. Groton scientists also oversaw trials of vaccine booster shots against new variants and local facilities helped produce lipids used in the delivery of vaccine doses.

Speculation is rampant that with Pfizer’s COVID remedies faltering the Groton labs will be hit hard perhaps in the range of the 200 layoffs already announced in Kalamazoo Mich. and hopefully fewer than the 500 expected in Sandwich England. One Pfizer site in Peapack N.J. is being shuttered entirely but no such drastic measure is expected in Groton despite the company’s decision to close its New London research-and-development headquarters a few years ago and move it to Cambridge Mass.

The most I could get out of the company was that the cuts were being done to increase efficiency and that they would occur on a rolling basis involving “some job loss across a number of our locations including Groton.”

OK there was a little more but not really much of anything. Unlike in 2011 when Pfizer announced publicly a reduction of 1100 employees in Groton the company lately has been steadfastly refusing to share local layoff details.

Groton City Mayor Keith Hedrick said he found this lack of communication to be problematic.

“My concern is people tend to panic” he said meaning people assume the worst when they don’t know anything.

Some people are longing for the “glory days” he said when Pfizer was manufacturing penicillin locally. But he knows those days of stability and local focus are over and “Pfizer is going to do what Pfizer is going to do.”

Still he rightly believes that a multinational corporation like Pfizer shouldn’t feed into the rumor mill by keeping people in suspense. And I will add that Pfizer also shouldn’t try to lie as officials did in a meeting with me and other Day journalists years ago after columnist David Collins speculated about the possible closure of the New London R&D headquarters when they flatly denied a closure was imminent (a year or so later it came to pass).

Pfizer rightly holds an honored place in southeastern Connecticut’s business climate and the men and women who contributed their talents to create the world’s first vaccine to fight COVID should be held in high esteem. In fact I’m surprised a parade in their honor hasn’t already been contemplated.

But the city needs to plan ahead for the tax consequences in case these layoffs are accompanied by demolition of buildings as occurred a decade ago when Pfizer decided to take down its massive former research headquarters known as Building 118. Real estate agents would no doubt like to know the impact as well given that the last major round of Pfizer layoffs here led to a dramatic lowering of home prices.

With luck and thanks to a bit more diversification in the local economy with the addition of the wind industry a renaissance in New London and a boom at Electric Boat the effect this time around likely will be minimal.

As Tony Sheridan chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce of Eastern Connecticut said “Thank god for EB. ... On the whole eastern Connecticut is doing great.”

San Antonio Spurs center Victor Wembanyama is reportedly ""intrigued"" by the idea of playing with Atlanta Hawks guard Trae Young.

""I will say I have talked to people who know Wemby who have indicated he is at least intrigued by the idea"" ESPN's Tim MacMahon said on the Hoop Collective (39:13 mark). ""Now intrigued by that idea and pounding the table are two very different things. I have no idea whether Gregg Popovich would be intrigued by the idea.""

San Antonio has been regularly mentioned as a potential suitor should the Hawks choose to trade Young who seems to have plateaued as the 1A option in Atlanta. Young averaged 25.7 points and 10.8 assists per game this season—his second straight 25-10 campaign—but the Hawks failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 2020.

The calculus may have changed in both Atlanta and San Antonio on Sunday with both teams coming away lottery winners. The Spurs will have picks Nos. 4 and 8 in the lottery after the Toronto Raptors' first-round pick was conveyed while the Hawks shocked the world to win the lottery.

Both teams face intriguing decisions on how to handle the draft over the next month. ESPN's Zach Lowe noted Atlanta faces a crossroads of sorts as it explores whether to trade the No. 1 pick for a veteran and continue building around Young and Dejounte Murray or make the pick and continue exploring their trade options with the two guards.

The Spurs are armed with cap space and a generational building block in Wembanyama who finished second in Defensive Player of the Year voting and won Rookie of the Year in 2023-24. It's possible they could look to kickstart their rebuild by floating one of those picks for a veteran who fits within Wembanyama's timeline.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9uMy5jb20vbmV3cy80LXN0YXItcGcta2luZy1ncmFjZS11cGRhdGVzLXJlY3J1aXRtZW50LXRhbGtzLWxzdS1taXNzaXNzaXBwaS1zdGF0ZS1zbXUtYW5kLXRjdS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,4-star PG King Grace updates recruitment talks LSU Mississippi State SMU and TCU,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimwFodHRwczovL29seW1waWNzLmNvbS9pb2MvbmV3cy9wLWctdG8tc3VwcG9ydC1vbHltcGljLXZpbGxhZ2UtbnVyc2VyeS1hcy1wYXJ0LW9mLWl0cy13aWRlc3QtZXZlci1yYW5nZS1vZi1nYW1lcy10aW1lLXNlcnZpY2VzLWZvci1hdGhsZXRlcy1kdXJpbmctcGFyaXMtMjAyNNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,P&G to support Olympic Village nursery as part of its widest ever range of Games-time services for athletes during Paris ...,"“P&G’s commitment to providing a broad range of essential services and products within the Athletes' Village exemplifies our shared vision of supporting athletes in their pursuit of excellence” said Anne-Sophie Voumard Managing Director of IOC Television & Marketing Services. “The introduction of the Olympic Village nursery a first in the Games' history highlights our dedication to inclusivity and athlete well-being ensuring that athlete parents have the necessary support to compete at their best.

These include Always as the Official Period Product of Paris 2024 running the “It's a New Period” campaign which is aimed at addressing and eliminating period anxiety in the world of sport.

The cultural relevance of the Olympic and Paralympic Games provides a strong platform for P&G brands and retailers to come together to engage consumers to drive the business.

“Every day P&G brands provide consumers with high performance products that they trust to meet their daily household and personal care needs for themselves and their families” said P&G Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard. “That inspired us to prominently feature how those superior performing products serve athletes families and fans so they can focus on achieving their personal best whether on the Olympic or Paralympic stage or in those everyday moments in life that matter.”

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure."

But there are exceptions.

Today's resilient but slow-growth nature of the tobacco industry has made it a specialty niche for dividend investors. Where else can you routinely find massive-yield dividend stocks like British American Tobacco (BTI 0.45%) which offers an 8.7% yield at its current price?

But these high yields can sometimes be a trap a sign that Wall Street sees risk and wants to be compensated accordingly to own the stock. So where does British American Tobacco fall? Is its hefty dividend trustworthy? Is the stock a buy sell or hold? Here is what you need to know.

Can you trust the dividend?

In most cases the dividend is the primary reason for owning tobacco stocks so it's a great place to start. British American Tobacco or BAT pays a hefty dividend that yields over 8% at its current share price. That's huge because if you understand that the S&P 500 has historically averaged annualized returns between 9% and 10% that dividend establishes a high floor for investment returns.

Dividends are paid in cash so investors can look at BAT's cash flow to see how easily it's funding its payout. Fortunately the dividend payout ratio is at just 50%. Even looking back five years the dividend has never seriously threatened to exceed the business's cash profits.

That means investors can buy British American Tobacco for its dividend and remain confident that the payments will keep coming barring a collapse in the company that shrinks profits. This of course is a legitimate investment risk so it's time to dig deeper.

A growing and diverse business

A handful of major companies dominate the global tobacco market. You're already reading about BAT which competes with Altria and Philip Morris International. Altria sells Marlboro cigarettes in America and Philip Morris sells them internationally along with its IQOS (heated tobacco) and Zyn (oral nicotine) products.

British American Tobacco could be the most diverse among these three companies. You see it enjoys a breadth of products and markets it serves. The company sells combustible cigarette brands worldwide including Dunhill Lucky Strike and Pall Mall. Additionally it sells Camel Newport and Natural American Spirit exclusively in the United States.

Product-wise the industry is juggling the slowly declining (but still very lucrative) cigarette business and emerging smokeless products like heated tobacco and oral nicotine pouches. BAT covers its bases here too. It sells Vuse for vaping Glo for heated tobacco and Velo for oral nicotine.

These new category products will grow large enough to turn profitable next year. Presently the company should do about 27 billion pounds in revenue this year and about 3 billion pounds will come from smokeless products. Through six months of this year new category revenue was up 29% year over year so it looks like the company is successfully building up its next-generation products.

Earnings per share (EPS) grew 5.3% year over year in the first half of 2023. This doesn't look like a collapsing business; it is a growing business. Investors should feel good about the dividend and BAT's performance.

Is British American Tobacco a buy sell or hold?

Dividend investors probably don't have any fundamental reason to sell shares. But should you be buying? Valuation is essential because a great business can be a lousy stock if the price isn't right.

A company growing at a mid-single-digit pace shouldn't fetch a steep valuation so keep that in mind. With that said shares could still be cheap.

At a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just seven even a 5% growth rate translates to a reasonable price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of just 1.4. At worst that's a fair price to pay for the growth you're getting. Throw in that juicy well-funded dividend and the stock begins looking attractive.

The verdict? Dividend investors can buy British American Tobacco with confidence.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAyLzUtc3AtNTAwLXN0b2Nrcy10aGF0LXBheS1hLWdlbmVyb3VzLWRpdmlkZW5kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,5 S&P 500 Stocks That Pay a Generous Dividend,"Investors are pocketing dividend yields between 4% and 9% with these stocks.

The S&P 500 is the benchmark for the investing world. This well-known index comprises 500 of the largest and most visible corporations in the United States the world's leading economy.

It's also a great hunting ground for phenomenal long-term stock ideas to fit any investing strategy. Dividend investors are a large group with a specific investing strategy buying stocks that will help them build large income streams from dividends. Many of these dividend enthusiasts rely on these five generous dividend-paying S&P 500 stocks for their huge payouts.

Let's find out a bit more about these five stocks.

1. Altria Group

American tobacco giant Altria Group (MO 0.70%) has made millions for shareholders over the past century selling Marlboro cigarettes in the United States. The company's golden years are far behind it now that the general public is better informed about the dangers of smoking. Still the addictive properties of nicotine give Altria the pricing power to continue growing profits despite smoking rates declining since the 1960s.

Cigarettes are cheap to manufacture so the company has few operating expenses. Most of Altria's profits go to shareholders as dividends. The company's dividend payout ratio is roughly 80% of cash flow. Altria's raised the dividend 58 times over the past 54 years meaning investors are getting paid more over time. Shares offer a generous 9.3% dividend yield at today's share price.

2. AbbVie

Pharmaceuticals are a lucrative industry especially if the company manages to develop a blockbuster drug. Patents protect proprietary formulas from competition for several years and allow the company to benefit from its development efforts. AbbVie (ABBV -0.27%) was a significant benefactor for several years from the success of Humira the world's top-selling drug. Unfortunately its patent protection expired recently. But don't worry; the company used its Humira profits to build the rest of the company into a juggernaut and it has several other drugs ready or in development to take up the slack.

AbbVie has become a favorite among dividend investors. Not only is the yield juicy at 4.5% but the payout has also grown by an average of 17% annually over the past decade. The dividend payout ratio is still manageable at 42% of cash flow so investors could see a nice one-two combo of yield and dividend growth moving forward.

3. Verizon Communications

Virtually everyone in America has a cellphone or smartphone. The importance of smartphones to consumers' everyday lives has made telecommunications companies like Verizon Communications (VZ) more like utility companies. People seemingly pay their phone bills as religiously as their water or electricity. This creates steady revenue streams for Verizon which results in fertile ground for steady and increasing dividend payments.

Verizon must invest constantly in upgrading and maintaining its wireless network so investors should look at net income instead of cash flow to judge the dividend. Fortunately Verizon spends just half its earnings on the dividend so investors should be in good shape with its 7.1% dividend yield.

4. Philip Morris International

Marlboro is a worldwide brand but Altria only sells it in America. Philip Morris International (PM 0.32%) was spun off from Altria over a decade ago and owns international rights to Marlboro. That shortens its dividend history but Philip Morris has raised its dividend yearly as a public company. That streak currently stands at 15 years. The dividend payout ratio is high at 103% but profits could grow and bring that ratio down over the coming years.

How? Philip Morris has done a great job innovating and moving into growing nicotine categories. It developed IQOS a device that heats (but doesn't burn) tobacco to produce vapor. It also acquired Swedish Match which makes the Zyn brand of oral nicotine pouches. Philip Morris is bringing these opportunities to global markets including America so the stock has long-term growth potential.

5. AT&T

A small group of significant players dominates the U.S. wireless communications market. Verizon is second-largest to AT&T (T -0.14%) which holds a 47% share. Today AT&T is a different company from what it's been for most of the decade. It tried failed and exited the entertainment industry and is now concentrating on telecommunications again. The stock offers a dividend yield of more than 6.8%.

It's not all rosy. The company still carries $138 billion in long-term debt scars from its former entertainment ambitions. However the dividend payout ratio is back to under half of net income after management cut the dividend once to free up more money to pay off its debt. Financially AT&T seems back on its feet giving investors confidence to continue the dividends.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBvc3QuY28ubnovbnotbmV3cy8zNTAxMjA3MTcvcG9saXRpY2FsLWluc2lkZXJzLWxpZnQtbGlkLXdoYXQtbG9iYnlpc3RzLWRvLXNoYWRvd3PSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Political insiders lift the lid on what lobbyists do in the shadows,,,,

It operates through the following segments: midstream chemicals refining and marketing and specialties. The midstream segment provides crude oil and refined petroleum product transportation and processing services as well as natural gas and natural gas liquids transportation storage fractionation gathering processing and marketing services. The chemicals segment consists of Phillips 66's 50% equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical (CPChem) which manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The refining business refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products such as gasoline distillates and aviation fuels as well as renewable fuels at 12 refineries in the U.S. and Europe. The marketing and specialties segment purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products and renewable fuels.

Percentage Ownership: n/a Average Cost: n/a Activist Commentary: Elliott is a very successful and astute activist investor. The firm's team includes analysts from leading tech private equity firms engineers operating partners – former technology CEOs and COOs. When evaluating an investment the firm also hires specialty and general management consultants expert cost analysts and industry specialists. The firm often watches companies for many years before investing and has an extensive stable of impressive board candidates. Elliott has historically focused on strategic activism in the technology sector and has been very successful with that strategy. However over the past several years its activism group has grown and evolved and the firm has been doing a lot more longer-term activism and creating value from a board level at a much larger breadth of companies. The firm's activism has always been well thought out and the detailed analysis it presented here is evidence of that.

On Wednesday Elliott sent a letter to Phillips 66 announcing that it has taken a $1 billion stake and is seeking up to two board seats.

Activist investors like to claim that they are ""amicable"" or ""constructive."" While we do not generalize like that it is hard to imagine a more amicable and constructive activist campaign than what Elliott is proposing at Phillips 66.

Phillips 66 has underperformed peers Valero Energy and Marathon Petroleum by 45% and 191% respectively over the past three years and by 163% and 248% respectively over the past 10 years. Elliott thinks this can largely be attributed to the company's shift in focus away from the refining segment and management's poor execution in cost reductions which has led to a loss of investor confidence.

Since his elevation to CEO in July 2022 Mark Lashier has committed to a strategic outlook that includes refocusing on the refining segment cutting costs targeting $14 billion of mid-cycle earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization by 2025 selling $3 billion of non-core assets and increasing the company's long-term capital return policy. Elliott wholeheartedly agrees with this plan and thinks it could lead to a $205 stock price. The first part of an activist campaign convincing management that your plan is better than theirs is already done here. The only thing activists like more than a management team agreeing with the activist's plan is a management team that has its own plan that the activist agrees with.

But communicating a plan to the market is one thing getting investors to believe that you can execute is entirely another. There has been a lack of shareholder trust here much of which stems from the company's AdvantEdge66 program in 2019 aimed at reducing costs. When implemented Phillips 66 saw costs increase relative to peers burning shareholders' confidence in the management team's ability to achieve its goals. The first step in rebuilding management credibility would be adding new directors to the board particularly at the request of a shareholder. If those directors happened to have refining operations experience that would give investors even more confidence that management is shifting their focus back to the refining business.

Elliott has significant experience in partnering with industry experts and has already identified candidates here with relevant expertise to fill two board seats. Elliott is not asking for a board seat for itself to debate with management. The firm is asking for two seats for two industry executives who would put management in the best position to execute on their plan. The best activists use board seats to support management in executing their plan but they also will hold management accountable if they are unable to do so.

That is where Elliott's plan B comes into play. If Phillips 66 adds two new directors approved by Elliott and still cannot deliver on performance targets over the next year then it will need to take a path like the one Marathon Petroleum took in its transformation. This will include making appropriate management changes closing the current $2 to $3 per barrel refining EBITDA gap between Phillips 66 and Valero and generating $15 billion to $20 billion from the sale of non-core assets including their CPChem stake European convenience stores and a portion of non-operated midstream stakes.

This should be an easy decision for the company and we would expect it to quickly appoint two new directors identified by Elliott to the board. Given the tone and substance of Elliott's outreach it would be very surprising and disappointing to see this go to a proxy fight. However if it did we believe Elliott would be a lock to get at least two board seats on the 13-person board particularly with the use of a universal proxy card.

Smith

Two suspects found themselves in police custody after a stolen vehicle they were driving crashed during a high-speed pursuit.

Linden Police officials said the chain of events began shortly before 7:00 a.m. precisely at 6:51 a.m. when officers responded to multiple frantic calls reporting a red Porsche driving recklessly within the Aviation Plaza parking lot.

Upon arrival at the scene officers quickly located the red Porsche which was subsequently identified as stolen from New York.

When the officers attempted to approach the vehicle it fled the parking lot at an alarming speed prompting a pursuit.

However this initial chase was swiftly terminated near the vicinity of W. 15th St.

Minutes later officers once again spotted the stolen vehicle at the intersection of South Wood Avenue & Route 1.

A second pursuit ensued as officers tried to halt the vehicle's escape. The pursuit continued northbound on Route 1 until it ended abruptly with a collision at the intersection of Morses Mill Road.

The driver lost control of the stolen vehicle crashing into the center median rendering it immobile.

With the stolen vehicle disabled two suspects fled on foot climbing a fence into the Phillips 66 Refinery.

Officers persisted in their pursuit successfully apprehending both suspects shortly afterward.

The driver of the vehicle struck during the pursuit was evaluated at the scene and declined further medical treatment.

One of the suspects identified as 22-year-old Mr. Marc Pierre from Maplewood faces multiple charges including second-degree possession of a stolen motor vehicle second-degree eluding third-degree trespassing and fourth-degree resisting arrest.

He has been remanded to the Essex County Jail pending a scheduled appearance in Superior Court.

Forde recently earned a spot in the West Indies white-ball squad debuting in a series of three One-Day Internationals (ODIs) against England which began at the Vivian Richards Cricket Ground near St John’s Antigua.

In an interview with Caribbean Premier League (CPL) Media Forde expressed his ambition to reach the pinnacle of all-round cricket and help West Indies cricket regain its top status. He stated “My goal is to be the No. 1 all-rounder in the world and to put West Indies cricket back to where it needs to be – at the top.”

Emphasized the dedication of himself

Forde a former West Indies Under-19 all-rounder emphasized the dedication of himself and his fellow younger teammates to achieve their collective goals. They diligently work on fitness mental preparation and overall cricket knowledge to fulfil their aspirations.

While Forde has recorded two half-centuries in top-flight cricket including the Lanka Premier League Twenty20 tournament and the West Indies Super50 tournament he is eager to enhance his all-round abilities further.

The young cricketer also expressed excitement about reuniting with West Indies white-ball coach Daren Sammy who played a pivotal role in his career. Sammy provided Forde with a significant opportunity to shine during the CPL T20 tournament last year when he played for the St Lucia Kings. Forde acknowledged Sammy’s trust and belief in his abilities which allowed him to perform and build a strong rapport with the coach.

The lead West Indies selector

Desmond Haynes the lead West Indies selector justified Forde’s inclusion in the ODI squad despite his modest performance of five wickets at an average of 31 during the CWI Academy’s Super50 Cup campaign. Haynes praised Forde as a “whole-hearted cricketer” and highlighted his potential as a key player for the future of West Indies cricket.

Matthew Forde considers his journey in the CPL as the foundation for his rise in the cricketing world and holds a special place in his heart for the St Lucia Kings where he made his initial impact.

Jacks 25 has played in all three formats for England over the past 12 months and was a surprise omission from the ECB's list of 29 players to receive a contract offer.

""It was a bit of a difficult one"" Jacks said on the eve of England's ODI opener against West Indies. ""I didn't really find out at all. I knew everyone was hearing and I was waiting to hope that I would find out and then I didn't. I just ended up seeing it on Twitter like everyone else did and that was obviously disappointing. I was hoping to get one.""

Jacks is in high demand on the T20 franchise circuit with contracts to play in the SA20 in January and the IPL in March. As a result the omission has been a double edged sword with Jacks now able to pick and choose his winter commitments as he builds to his number one priority: making the squad for the 2024 World Cup.

""The last two World Cup years I've just narrowly missed out on selection so making the World Cup squad is a massive goal of mine and playing T20 cricket in South Africa against some of the best players will be perfect for that.""

The difficulty for England and Jacks is that the SA20 clashes with England's Test series against India where given the explosive batters' ability with the ball and his strong performances in Pakistan last year he would be a likely candidate for selection in the squad if not the playing XI.

""I wouldn't say it's changed my motivation to play for England"" Jacks said in regards to whether the snub has led to him re-jigging his priorities. ""Obviously England is the pinnacle and I want to play as much as I can but what it has done is managed my expectations.

""The India Test matches have obviously been in the back of everyone's mind for the recent period - it's such a massive series and there's all the talk about spin and the need for allrounders and having a deep squad. So it's probably just that instead of me thinking that I was going to be picked I'm now thinking okay if they wanted to pick me then realistically I would have been given a contract. So the fact that they haven't given me one probably says something.""

Where Jacks is definitely wanted however is here and now. Jos Buttler and Matthew Mott have confirmed to him that he will open in all three ODIs alongside Phil Salt as they look to give their high-risk high-reward openers as much opportunity for success as possible.

""That [backing] is huge for everyone"" Jacks said. ""If you bring in a fear of failure or worry about if you are going to play or not obviously that hinders your performance and you won't be able to go out there and play with 100 percent confidence. That is really important in any team you play for and especially for England. Everyone knows how high the competition is for places.""

England are not expecting the three-match ODI series to be a high-scoring encounter with the training wickets at the Sir Vivian Richards stadium taking a lot of spin and scores in and around the 250-300 mark assumed to be closer to par.

""It's going to be a bit more - not a grind - but you're really going to have to think your way through an innings and treat it like it is a longer format…there's no worries of it becoming an extended T20.""

Sunday's match kicks off at 9:30am a non-issue for a group still just about on UK time and waking up at 6am naturally. But on Saturday the squad had an earlier wake up call than normal when an earthquake registering 5.2 on the Richter scale struck Antigua. No major damage on the island was experienced but for a group of lads from Shires Manchester and Surrey it was a new experience.

""We're all claiming that we're earthquake survivors now"" joked Jacks who slept through the whole thing. ""I woke up at about six saw the messages on the group and couldn't really believe it. Some of the guys said their whole room was shaking and everything.""

With England staying at a resort on the south-east corner of the island that looks straight out across the ocean some players were more concerned than others.",,,,,,,,,

The ruling came from Judge Richard Seeborg of the US District Court for the Northern District of California on Thursday as he granted Google’s motion to dismiss. The judge argued that the plaintiffs’ antitrust claims were undermined by the existence of several competitors offering mapping services that are deemed “as good as or better in terms of performance and/or cost.”

Last year digital advertising business Dream Big Media and other plaintiffs initiated a proposed class action asserting that Google compelled users of digital mapping products into a bundled service known as a “tying” agreement. Subsequently Google allegedly increased the costs associated with these products.

Judge Seeborg’s order emphasized that the presence of robust competition from alternatives such as Apple Maps and MapQuest weakened the argument that Google’s services were monopolistic. He stated “Competitors to Google’s mapping products include Apple Maps and MapQuest which undermine any argument that each service could be both tying and tied.”

This case is just one among several targeting Alphabet’s Google unit alleging antitrust violations in various online markets including search advertising and app distribution through the Google Play Store. Notably Google’s $1.1 billion acquisition of mapping app Waze in 2013 drew scrutiny from the Federal Trade Commission.

The recent decision follows a US antitrust trial that concluded last month focusing on Department of Justice allegations that Google maintained a monopoly over search controlling nearly 90% of online queries. The tech giant was represented by Jones Day while the plaintiffs were represented by ESQgo PC Nematzadeh PLLC and Balestriere Fariello.

Maxine Waters asks PNC Wells to put bank branches in her district,"Representative Maxine Waters a Democrat from California held a town hall meeting on Saturday at Inglewood High School where she pointedly asked executives from City National Bank PNC Financial Services and Wells Fargo & Co. if they would each open a branch in her district.

LOS ANGELES – Rep. Maxine Waters held a town hall meeting on Saturday where she pointedly asked executives from City National Bank PNC Financial Services and Wells Fargo & Co. if they would each open a branch in her district. She said she wanted to hold the banks accountable for promises made in recent merger agreements or consent orders.

The town hall meeting at Inglewood High School got fiery at times as Waters pressed the three bank executives to answer questions from constituents in her 43rd congressional district in South Los Angeles. Waters the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee said she invited all the top banks to attend but was turned down by Bank of America Citigroup JPMorgan Chase and U.S. Bancorp.

Next week the Senate Banking Committee plans to hold an annual oversight hearing with executives from the nation's top banks. Waters said she was disappointed that Republicans in the House would not hold a similar hearing. Her town hall she said would try to fill in the gap.

When Jeffrey Martinez executive vice president and head of branch banking at PNC Bank described how the Pittsburgh bank was upholding its pledge to invest an eye-popping $88 billion in local communities over four years as part of its 2020 acquisition of BBVA  Waters asked specifically if PNC was coming to her neighborhood.

""When are you going to open up a branch in my district?"" Waters said. ""We have a problem with branch banking not being available to us in all of our communities in the way they should be. We call them banking deserts.""

Martinez responded: ""That's a great question it's an important one and one of the things we've slated even though we're new to California.""

""We would like to help you find a location"" Waters said to thunderous applause and laughter from the crowd of about 300. ""I'm so looking forward to establishing"" a branch here she added.

Waters then described how City National Bank in Los Angeles had agreed in January to pay $31 million to settle redlining allegations brought by the Justice Department. As part of the agreement City National has promised to open one branch in a majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhood in L.A. County.

""Can you discuss where you might be opening the branch?"" Waters asked. ""Where are you with all of this?""

David Cameron City National's executive vice president of personal and business banking responded ""That is a great question"" drawing laughter from the audience.

""I don't have any announcement on where we're going to put that branch.""

To which Waters replied: ""Oh we'll help you"" to further applause from the audience.

City National plans ""to go above and beyond"" the agreement to invest at least $29.5 million in a loan subsidy fund for residents of majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Los Angeles County Cameron said. The bank has hired more than 20 loan officers to support the initiative to provide grants of up to $15000 each to first-time homebuyers.

Waters also questioned why City National did not have a mortgage loan officer at a local branch on Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles.

""You've done well at that branch are you going to expand that branch and put a loan officer there?"" Waters said. ""Can you do these things?""

Waters skillfully thanked each of the bankers for showing up to the town hall meeting while also hitting them hard on consent orders.

""I really thank you for coming today. I know that you know we have a lot of questions for you based on the fines that you received and all of that"" she told Cameron and then asked the audience to give him a round of applause.

She also asked Colleen Canny Wells Fargo's executive vice president and national head of branch banking why the San Francisco bank has been closing so many branches  which Waters estimated at 2000 branch closings over many years. She cited the Wells Fargo 2016 fake accounts scandal that led the Federal Reserve to impose an asset cap on the bank.

""First tell us why did you close those branches?"" Waters asked.

Canny said that customer transactions through branches have fallen 50% over the past three years as more banking is done online through mobile apps or ATMs.

""We still think branches are important and we continue to look at our branch footprint to ensure we have the proper coverage"" Canny said.

Waters lamented that banks are closing branches in inner cities where seniors who may not necessarily use a cell phone to bank still prefer to go to a branch in person.

""I want to tell you something that is a cultural discovery for everybody"" Waters told the bankers and the audience. ""We like to go to a teller as we put our money across the counter. We like this kind of interaction with the people that we do service with and this is the kind of cultural consideration that the bank should take into account.""

At the town hall which lasted for four hours constituents asked a wide range of questions including why there were long lines at their local branches and why they were not able to get small business loans or even speak directly to the same banker on each visit. CFPB Director Rohit Chopra who spoke after the bankers answered a range of questions on reverse mortgages digital redlining and junk fees.

Waters also lambasted the banking industry generally for Republican-led efforts in the House which voted on Friday to nullify the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's small-business data-collection rule . Despite the bill's passage in a 221-202 vote President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the bill and uphold the rule.

The head organizer for Rise Economy the consumer group formerly known as the California Community Reinvestment Coalition asked the bankers generally why they did not support the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

""Your industry trade groups are attacking the CFPB they're attacking fundamental consumer protections … and very basic data on small business lending that we fought hard for for nearly 10 years"" said Jyotswaroop Kaur Bawa chief of organizing and campaigns at Rise Economy. ""We want you to tell us specifically how many Black and Hispanic-owned businesses you make loans to and at what rate—that's what the fight is about.""

Politics and policy House votes to nullify CFPB small-business data rule Republicans and a handful of Democrats in the House and Senate which already had passed an identical bill say the data-collection rule would be too onerous for lenders and small-business borrowers. President Biden is expected to veto the legislation. December 1

The small-business lending rule is expected to be used by the CFPB to identify discrimination though the bureau exempted more than 2000 community banks and small businesses from the rule. The coalition sued the CFPB in 2019 for taking so long to issue the rule which Dodd-Frank's Section 1071 mandated.

The 1071 rule was about wealth-building and closing the wealth gap Waters said.

""The Senate Republicans put up a great fight against getting the rule the data that we needed to determine why we can't get small business loans — they fought us very hard and they said they represented the banks"" Waters said. ""Republicans won on trying to kill that rule that would give us information that would show that Blacks Latinos women and LGBTQ would not be getting small business [loans.]""

Water did commend one bank: First Citizens BancShares which acquired the failed Silicon Valley Bank and last month announced an agreement to invest more than $6.5 billion in California and Massachusetts communities through an updated community benefits plan. The agreement Waters said paved the way for a branch to be opened in Watts.

Waters characteristically played to the audience by rattling off the various programs created after the pandemic including loans that banks delivered via the Paycheck Protection Program.

""You're wondering if there's all this money around why haven't we been able to get some of it"" Waters said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvZ2lmdHMtc29uZy10d2VsdmUtZGF5cy1jaHJpc3RtYXMtaW5jcmVhc2VkLTItNy10aGlzLXllYXItcG5j0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94YnVzaW5lc3MuY29tL2xpZmVzdHlsZS9naWZ0cy1zb25nLXR3ZWx2ZS1kYXlzLWNocmlzdG1hcy1pbmNyZWFzZWQtMi03LXRoaXMteWVhci1wbmMuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Gifts in the song 'Twelve Days of Christmas' increased 2.7% this year: PNC,"There was a slight collective price increase in the presents given in the ""Twelve Days of Christmas"" this year the PNC Christmas Price Index indicated.

The financial services company said how much the gift-giving ""true love"" would have to shell out for the presents in the well-known song experienced a 2.7% year-over-year increase coming in at $46729.86 for 2023.

It would require a whopping $201972.66 for the ""Twelve Days of Christmas"" if one looked at the 364 presents cumulatively given over the course of the whole song according to PNC. Prior to 2023 it had never reached above $200000.

Those figures come after last year’s PNC Christmas Price Index amounted to $45523.27 for the 12 gifts and $197071 for the 364.

For 2023 PNC said the various holiday gifts bestowed by the ""true love"" respectively cost the following:

-Partridge in a pear tree at $319.18

-Two turtle doves at $750

-Three French hens at $330

-Four calling birds at $599.96

-Five golden rings at $1245

-11 pipers piping at $3207.38

-12 drummers drumming at $3468.02

Of the 12 gift types seven had their costs go up and five kept the same level as last year.

The partridge up 13.9% year-over-year and the two turtle doves up 25% year-over-year demonstrated the most notable jumps according to PNC. The bank linked those to rising ""housing costs"" of the pear tree and to rarity respectively.

""Rising wages for skilled labor represented by the performers"" also played a part in the ""Twelves Days of Christmas"" gifts experiencing an overall increase PNC said.

People who bank with PNC are noticing unauthorized charges and should check their balances reports the NBC-affiliated news station WPXI.

Tom Rubritz is one of the first people to realize something is wrong with his balance.

He noticed an unusual withdrawal hit his family’s account while his wife was out shopping.

“My wife was out shopping today so I went and was just checking on the account and looking at purchases and everything and I noticed a miscellaneous withdrawal of $11.72 in my account…

It’s a little concerning because it’s my money and nobody else’s. I was a little worried that’s how scammers work. They start small and then go big.”

The charges appear as “pending debit” with a random amount of money charged to the account.

A spokesperson at the bank says the unauthorized withdrawals are due to a “processing error” and its systems have not been compromised by hackers.

“Out teams have taken steps to resolve the issue which will correct any incorrect transactions displayed in customer accounts.”

The bank says customers do not need to reach out about unwanted withdrawals and says all erroneous charges will be automatically rolled back.

This is the second account balance issue at PNC in a matter of weeks.

On November 14th the bank said it was working to resolve a separate issue as a “limited number” of customers witnessed pending transactions pop up in their accounts more than once.

It seems like only yesterday Australians were told they were about to wake up to a new utopia. Vegemite in every cupboard and a surf ranch in every back yard. Yes the unveiling of Kelly Slater’s manmade wave miracle there in the cow stink of Lemoore heralded a bold new age for the nation of surf mad huis. Exciting proposals popped up directly. A rusty plunger built in Yeppoon.

And yet nearly one decade on only one public wave generating facility has been built down in Melbourne. The aforementioned Surf Lakes facility in Yeppoon still just an invite-only prototype.

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation wondering why visited with Surf Lakes founder Aaron Trevis who declared there is simply no money for the things. He was hoping to have $50 million raised by now. Alas he has not. “I was hoping to be there already” he sadly stated “but that’s the challenge. At this stage it is really about the money to be honest.”

Urbnsrf the one operating in Melbourne is planning another in Sydney scheduled to open next year and another in Perth. The Kelly Slater Surf Ranch set to be built on pristine wetlands shuttered forever.

And that’s it that’s all.

ABC concluded:

Not only are surf parks complicated and costly to develop operators say they are expensive to run.

Making waves is energy intensive and a steady stream of cashed-up surfers are required to keep the lights on and the pumps running day and night.

The emerging business model is for the pool to serve as the centrepiece of a larger integrated development with multiple revenue streams.

But developers said institutional investors viewed surf parks as a new — and therefore risky — phenomenon and were reluctant to fund them.

The Wavegarden technology is the most efficient with annual operating expenses at roughly $11.5 million. Cost for the surfer also economical with “12 guaranteed waves costing between $80 and $160.”

Slater’s the most expense with a private day rate of $70000. “It turns a profit but its clientele are almost exclusively Silicon Valley executives and their mates or sponsored professionals.”

The piece went on to discuss more troubles with the surf tank model but pivoted sort of anti-depressive at the end attempting to maybe imagine a future sotted with tubs.

(NYSE:XPO)?,"Let's talk about the popular XPO Inc. ( ). The company's shares led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on XPO’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists.

Is XPO Still Cheap?

Great news for investors – XPO is still trading at a fairly cheap price. According to my valuation the intrinsic value for the stock is $146.32 but it is currently trading at US$90.31 on the share market meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because XPO’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market providing a prime buying opportunity.

What kind of growth will XPO generate?

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years the future seems bright for XPO. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock which should feed into a higher share valuation.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? Since XPO is currently undervalued it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider which could explain the current undervaluation.

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on XPO for a while now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet which means it’s not too late to buy XPO. But before you make any investment decisions consider other factors such as the track record of its management team in order to make a well-informed buy.

So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing. In terms of investment risks  and understanding these should be part of your investment process.

We’re excited to share the thoughts of fintech CEOs and industry leaders from across the globe to 2023’s key takeaways and what we should expect to be top of the agenda in 2024.

Generative AI a transformative force within the financial industry takes centre stage today as experts from Finastra Fujitsu Workiva and Unqork provide their 2023 reflections and forward-looking perspectives and predictions for the future.

Finastra underscores its significance in financial software development while Fujitsu highlights its role in ESG and data classification. Workiva sees it as a means to boost employee productivity and Unqork envisions its potential in migrating legacy systems and fostering collaboration between business and technology.

‘Generative AI is not going anywhere’

As we approach 2024 the landscape of corporate reporting and compliance is undergoing a significant transformation. In this dynamic environment generative AI is poised to take centre stage according to global software-as-a-service company Workiva.

“Looking forward to 2024 it’s clear generative AI is going to make an impact – especially when it comes to corporate reporting and compliance” says Steve Soter vice president and industry principal at Workiva.

“Next year we’ll begin to see reporting teams moving beyond experimentation to using generative AI to boost productivity in meaningful ways such as drafting starter disclosures and performing data analyses. There’s also a near-term opportunity to leverage generative AI as a compliance check focusing on how internal teams meet disclosure requirements and even leveraged to perform audit tests and audit reporting.

“For these reasons in relatively short-order generative AI will become increasingly critical in boosting efficiency and enabling insights that lead to better and faster data-driven decisions. As the momentum of generative AI increases so do the attendant risks and it will be paramount for organisations to ensure proper governance controls and human oversight of the nascent technology. One aspect which is clear is that generative AI is not going anywhere and will play a crucial role in the technology sector in 2024.”

‘Solid progress in improving or deploying AI’

Soter’s insights into the growing role of generative AI find resonance in the observations of Simon Paris CEO of fintech Finastra particularly in the realm of ESG and data classification.

“While financial and other institutions have been buffered from the geopolitical and macroeconomic storms that continued throughout 2023 high levels of tech investment remain a priority for many. Within this trend and for financial institutions’ 2024 outlook specifically our recent Financial Services State of the Nation survey showed that investments into AI BaaS and embedded finance remain investment priorities over the next 12 months.

“AI is unsurprisingly high on the agenda and we are seeing institutions make solid progress in improving or deploying AI including ML NLP or RPA. What is surprising however is the significant progress already made in generative AI; over a quarter of respondents claimed their institution had already incorporated it in some form and just 6% said their institution wasn’t interested in it. I’m personally excited to see that the most widely cited use case for gen AI was for ESG purposes specifically data classification and supporting decision-making.

“Finally and perhaps most interestingly of all given geopolitical and macro-economic context our survey showed that financial institutions’ executives’ optimism is high; nearly nine in 10 decision-makers worldwide are excited about the opportunities presented by the pace of technological and cultural change within the sector. As we believe it is only by combining a thoughtful leverage of technology and a continued cultural shift that we will see a widespread adoption of open finance and all the potential socioeconomic and sustainability benefits that it can unlock.”

“A transformative solution’

Krista Griggs head of banking financial services and insurance at Fujitsu also outlines AI’s transformative potential to enhance employee productivity and optimise operations addressing the persistent challenges in the financial industry.

“When we look at generative AI it is already embedded in ‘mainstream’ technology like Microsoft’s co-pilot will be everywhere” she says. “As global superpowers debate security trust and intellectual property the adoption of these cutting-edge technologies will continue to surge.

“However while mainstream banks have reported strong financial performance this year much of this success can be attributed to interest rate delays for deposits and headwinds remain in the form of high customer acquisition and service costs.

“Generative AI offers a transformative solution—a step change in employee productivity. By automating routine tasks financial institutions can redirect saved resources toward more strategic initiatives. The pressure to optimise operations has never been greater and gen AI is the answer.”

‘Analyse IT systems’

While generative AI has emerged as a disruptive trend in 2023 Gary Hoberman CEO/founder of codeless development platform Unqork stresses the need to go beyond simply generating more code and instead leverage generative AI’s potential to analyse and migrate legacy IT systems.

“The one thing I am certain of is whichever technology or platform your IT team is creating financial software with today it has a shelf life and will go ‘end-of-life” he says. “Each new application created is just adding to the prior technical debt and legacy build-up weighing down what could be great financial institutions.

“In 2023 the most disruptive trend was undoubtedly generative AI. While it’s a fantastic tool I absolutely do not recommend using it to generate code or build new applications. It can surely create code faster but that code will have the same shelf life so just creating more legacy faster is making companies worse off.

“In 2024 I believe that generative AI will increasingly be used to analyse legacy IT systems and help migrate them to future-proof options reversing decades of technical debt. Specialised AI models can provide details on how an application’s purpose and functionality can be migrated to newer legacy-free platforms offering a more time- and cost-effective solution to modernisation.

“I also foresee the idea of ‘citizen developers’ morphing to a world where business and technology work together to create future-proof software on the same platform.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhc3Rjb21wYW55LmNvbS85MDk5MTU0Mi9ob3VzaW5nLW1hcmtldC1hc3N1bWFibGUtbW9ydGdhZ2UtcmF0ZS1wb3J0YWwtc3RhcnR1cC1yb2Ft0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A back door to a 3% mortgage rate?

In today's growth-driven market it's easy to get caught up in popular stocks that are capturing the spotlight and overlook the steady performers. A great example is Procter & Gamble (PG -0.90%) commonly known as P&G.

P&G is a $393 billion-dollar behemoth that just hit an all-time high making it the second-most valuable U.S.-based consumer staples company ahead of Costco Wholesale and just behind Walmart.

P&G owns several popular personal care and household goods brands like Pampers Tide Bounty Charmin Gillette Old Spice Dawn and dozens more. These brands don't attract the glitz and glam of popular luxury products. But that doesn't mean P&G lacks pricing power or a loyal customer base.

Here's why P&G hit an all-time high for all the right reasons and why the dividend stock is worth considering now.

Executing despite myriad challenges

It took over two years but P&G finally eclipsed its previous all-time high on Jan. 21 2022 of $165.35 a share.

Back then supply chain bottlenecks were still a widespread issue. It wasn't yet known how bad inflation would be or how long it would last. But P&G has done a masterful job navigating these issues. Its execution is one of the core reasons the stock deserves to make a new all-time high.

The easiest two ways for P&G to grow its business are higher volume and higher prices. Recently volumes have been close to flat but P&G has grown earnings thanks to higher margins and productivity savings.

Perhaps the simplest way to showcase P&G's success during this challenging time is to look at its sales and operating margin.

As the chart shows P&G's sales surged over the last five years. Its margins only took a slight hit in 2022 and 2023 and have recovered to their highest level in 10 years.

During inflationary times investors expect a company's sales to rise more than usual. However these price increases are typically offset by higher costs which can erode margins if the company lacks pricing power.

But in P&G's case the margins held up and sales were higher which drove growth for the company.

Looking at sales paired with operating margin is a good way to measure if sales growth is healthy or not. The metrics indicate that P&G was able to successfully pass along higher costs to customers -- a testament to the perceived quality of its portfolio of brands. Granted volume growth will eventually need to come back because there's a limit to how much P&G can raise prices without doing more harm than good.

A justifiably expensive stock

P&G has historically traded at a premium valuation. Its current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio and median P/E over several different time intervals are all more than 25.

You may be wondering why such a low-growth business deserves a high valuation. The reason is that P&G excels at delivering on its promises to shareholders.

Given the nature of its business P&G only has so many ways to unlock growth before its spending would be reckless. The trick is to allocate capital wisely by building a strong portfolio of brands that achieves pricing power and can steadily grow earnings over time while rewarding shareholders with buybacks and dividends. P&G has done exactly that over its rich history.

The stock has doubled over the last decade the dividend and earnings are up more than 50% and P&G has reduced its outstanding share count by 12.9%. It's not a jaw-dropping performance but it checks the boxes that value and income investors may be seeking.

Dividend quality over quantity

In April P&G announced a sizable 7% increase to its dividend bringing the quarterly dividend above $1 a share and marking the 68th consecutive annual increase. P&G is the longest-tenured consumer staple Dividend King part of an elite cohort of companies that have increased their payouts for at least 50 years.

P&G's track record for dividend increases and the size of its increases make it one of the most reliable dividend stocks out there. But as mentioned the company also buys back its own stock which extends the capital return program beyond just dividends.

Despite being at an all-time high P&G still yields 2.4%. It's not an ultra-high yield but it is a decent one especially coming from such a high-caliber company. And over the years P&G has proven it isn't just a passive income play. The company has grown in value rewarding shareholders with a blend of capital gains and dividend income.

Over the last three years P&G has a nearly identical total return to that of the S&P 500 at 30.6% for P&G and 30.7% for the index compared to 17.9% for the consumer staples sector. P&G has underperformed the S&P 500 over the last five-year and 10-year time frames but crushed the performance of its sector. Still P&G has put up impressive results during a very strong market period led mostly by high growth tech-orientated companies. It's been difficult for the more defensive pockets of the market to keep pace with the indexes during this time yet P&G has still put up respectable gains while rewarding its shareholders.

A foundational dividend stock

P&G is not a cheap stock but it has made a new all-time high for the right reasons. The recent dividend raise was sizable and P&G's margins and sales growth have been impressive given the circumstances.

Part of the recent run-up in P&G stock is likely due to the consumer staples sector hitting a 52-week high on May 10 as some investors get more defensive amid higher equity valuations and the risk of interest rates staying higher for longer.

Overall P&G isn't a screaming buy but it remains a foundational holding with a compelling investment thesis that can back up its current valuation."

We all know the 53-year-old actor and comedian better as ""Flo"" the walking representation of Progressive Insurance in advertisements—just one of the many mascots in the ""vigorous ... brand-character orgy"" that helps firms sell the decidedly unsexy product of insurance (think the Geico Gecko the Aflac Duck Jake from State Farm etc.) per the New York Times . In her deep dive into Courtney Caity Weaver explores the ""moderately whimsical employee-character"" of Courtney's Flo who made her debut in 2008 and has become ""so inextricably linked with the brand that the two can no longer be separated for measurement.""

Weaver takes a look at the background of Courtney whose original plans included landing a starring role on Broadway or plying her craft as a comedic actress. She even tried out for (and failed to get) the role of Joan on Mad Men. Instead at the age of 38 Courtney landed the role of Flo which she's now owned for 15 years and counting. If you're in Los Angeles you can still catch Courtney keeping her comedy chops active in weekly improv shows by the Groundlings—the troupe constantly plumbed for fresh talent by Saturday Night Live which never took an interest in Courtney. ""I remember feeling so terrible. And just embarrassed"" Courtney said of her rejection by the popular sketch show. Meanwhile Groundlings colleague (and eventual SNL star Kristen Wiig) calls Courtney a ""masterful improviser"" and ""one of the funniest people I've ever known in my life.""

As the US civil rights movement gained traction early in the decade the company would have to confront segregation and its corrosive impact on “respect for the individual.”

For company president Thomas J. Watson Jr. the issue was both business and personal. IBM had long maintained an informal policy of non-discrimination based on race. As the company entered an era of booming growth for its computers it planned to expand with new factories in North Carolina and Kentucky where it would run a racially integrated workforce. In 1953 Watson Jr. expressed personal conviction and decades of company practice when he penned “Policy Letter #4” IBM’s first official equal opportunity policy.

He took a stand. “It is the policy of this organization to hire people who have the personality talent and background necessary to fill a given job regardless of race color or creed” the letter read. It came a year before the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education court decision that integrated public schools and more than a decade before passage of the Civil Rights Act.

Watson was intolerant of managers who fell short of his policies. Once upon hearing of a candidate’s rejection after eight interviews and possible discrimination Watson Jr. exploded. “What are we coming to in IBM? God almighty fellas we live in America — this country was created by people who were persecuted overseas. … How can I stand up and tell people tell chairmen of organizations how wonderful we are with our lack of discrimination and look at the action that you fellas and your associates are taking” he said.

In 1962 the company signed on to President John F. Kennedy’s “Plan for Progress” vowing among other things to strengthen its commitment to equal opportunity without regard to “race creed color sex national origin or age.” IBM had been making that very pledge to its employees for decades. In 1968 the company would put its money where its policies were opening a manufacturing facility that would employ 300 local residents in the under-resourced Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant. The new jobs Watson Jr. hoped would improve the quality of life in these neighborhoods and create opportunities for those who wanted to work elsewhere.

It would continue to build on these initiatives for years to come and has often been one step ahead of the changes moving society.

For example IBM has been on the front lines of adopting protections for the LGBTQ+ community and promoting inclusivity in business. In 1984 it became one of the first companies to add sexual orientation to its global nondiscrimination policy. In 1995 it formed an LGBTQ+ Executive Council. In 1996 it extended healthcare coverage and other benefits to the partners of its gay and lesbian employees making it the largest US company at the time to adopt such a policy. In 2002 it also incorporated gender identity and expression into its nondiscrimination policy.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm9ncmVzc2l2ZXJhaWxyb2FkaW5nLmNvbS9SYWlsUHJpbWUvRGV0YWlscy9Nb250cmVhbC1NYWluZS1BdGxhbnRpYy10YXBzLUdyaW5kcm9kLWZvci10b3AtZXhlYy1wb3N0LXByZXBhcmVzLWZvci1KYW51YXJ5LXN0YXJ0dXAtMTIyMjAwMi0tNzA3NTfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Montreal Maine & Atlantic taps Grindrod for top-exec post prepares for January startup (12/2/2002) - RailPrime ...,"Montreal Maine & Atlantic Corp.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- One of Mayor Brandon Johnson's strongest allies is leveling some harsh criticism at him on a podcast recently suggesting he may not have been ready for the job.

Ald. Jeanette Taylor is known for speaking her mind despite possible fallout making headlines in 2021 when she went toe-to-toe with then-Mayor Lori Lightfoot during a tense city council meeting. Now the outspoken representative of the city's 20th Ward is back in the spotlight for recent comments she made on the Ben Joravsky Show.

""A we should not be on the fifth floor. And I'm speaking my whole heart"" she said on the podcast. ""We were not ready because we haven't been in government long enough to know how government really works.""

Taylor was not available for a follow-up interview but her comments were referencing the progressive movement that she and Mayor Johnson have been part of for years.

""I felt like we not ready and it's showing out in the wash. I don't got to say it people see it"" she said on the show. ""We're pretending like now we got the power let us show you how it's supposed to be done. And we look real stupid right now.""

""I think the movement and the mayor have some serious concerns here because people are speaking out publicly about some of his shortcomings or about some of the shortcomings of the movement very early in his administration and that's not a good sign"" said Laura Washington ABC7 political analyst.

Some of Taylor's frustrations stem from the migrant crisis. But another progressive mayoral ally Ald. William Hall suggested Taylor's criticism is off base.

""So for us to again sit on the sidelines and criticize an administration and a mayor and not walk in his shoes not have the responsibility it has is sideline spectating"" Hall said.

But as Taylor demonstrated in a recent council meeting she's not worried what people think of her.

""I don't care if you don't like me join the club we got jackets"" she said at the time.

""Everyone's frustrated confused upset but that's not a reflection of how this will end"" Hall said.

Johnson declined to respond to Taylor's remarks but a spokesman said the administration is still ready and willing to work with her and listen to her concerns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5mb29sLmNvbS90aGUtYXNjZW50L2luc3VyYW5jZS9hdXRvL2FydGljbGVzL3dhbnRpbmctdG8tYnV5LWFuLWV2LWhlcmVzLWhvdy1tdWNoLW1vcmUteW91LWNvdWxkLXBheS1pbi1hdXRvLWluc3VyYW5jZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wanting to Buy an EV? Here's How Much More You Could Pay in Auto Insurance,"KEY POINTS The author would pay 98% and 24% more for EV comprehensive and collision auto insurance but they'd spend 5% less for liability insurance.

Costs depend on factors like location model and insurance choices.

You can lower premiums by shopping around and adjusting deductibles. Check out our pick for the best cash back credit card of 2024

It's happening. I'm switching from a hybrid to an electric vehicle (EV) and I'm not alone. According to Pew Research about 4 in 10 Americans are thinking seriously about making the switch. Why? Reasons people cite include ""better for the environment"" and ""cheaper fuel prices."" That checks out. But two things make me hesitate -- still -- before shelling out: sticker shock and the cost of auto insurance. Electric vehicles in the U.S. are typically pricier than their ICE (internal combustion engine) counterparts. Take the baseline Ford F-150 which is about $15000 cheaper than the electric Ford Lightning base model (before tax credits). Yeeouch. That right there could be a budget-breaker. It's costly. Then there's the secondary effect. Pricier cars are typically more expensive to insure. You could pay much more to insure an EV than a lower-priced gas-powered alternative. How much depends on everything from your location to your car's model. In short it's complicated. For a quick idea of how much more you could pay in auto insurance I've pulled quotes for four models of 2023 Ford F-150s. Read on to compare the cost of insurance. You could pay 5% less for basic EV insurance I compared how much it costs to insure four models of the Ford F-150 the 2023 best-selling vehicle in the U.S. according to Car and Driver. I used a generic gas-powered Ford F-150 as the baseline. This is how much more expensive it is to get EV/Hybrid insurance. Read more: check out our picks for the best car insurance companies

Model % More Expensive than Base (Liability) % More Expensive than Base (Comprehensive) % More Expensive than Base (Collision) Ford F-150 (Baseline) - - - Ford F-150 Lightning (5%) 98% 24% Ford F-150 Hybrid (1) 1% 76% 24% Ford F-150 Hybrid (2) 1% 98% 45% Source: Progressive.com. Assumed annual mileage slightly above 15000 (based on U.S. Dept of Transportation annual mileage data). Assumed most basic insurance per model. Assumed vehicle financing (instead of lease or purchase).

Results: Progressive quoted me 98% and 24% more for EV comprehensive and collision auto insurance but 5% less for liability insurance. Color me surprised. Typically specialty vehicles like the Ford Lightning are more expensive to insure. This might reflect data suggesting that Lightning drivers are less likely to be involved in accidents or cause damage or it could be related to safety features specific to the Lightning. There's no way to know for sure. Prices vary significantly by location insurer and model. The results can be surprising. (Case in point: I'd pay Progressive more to insure some Ford Hybrids than a Ford Lightning!) Compare car insurance quotes to check how much you'd pay. Lowering the cost of insurance To lower the cost of insurance I'll be doing a few things. One is getting quotes from the best cheap car insurers in California where I live. I'll take the best deal available. If my family uses the same insurer I'll see if we can bundle to lower our premium by 5% to 10%. Another thing I'll do is adjust my deductible. I can lower the cost of car insurance by raising the deductible to a reasonable level. It'll shrink monthly premiums though I'll pay more if I get into an accident. To compensate I'll contribute enough to my emergency savings to cover it. I may opt out of collision insurance an optional type of insurance. Most drivers only need liability insurance which is required by state law. If I lease my car I'll probably need to purchase liability and comprehensive insurance. That'll bring my premiums up. Cost of ownership What more you could pay in auto insurance might be partially offset by fuel savings. Tesla's website claims the average American could save $1200 yearly by fueling an electric vehicle. It's worth keeping an eye on the bigger picture -- total cost of ownership -- when tallying costs. The total cost of ownership of a vehicle includes sticker price insurance cost of fuel cost of maintenance and how much you could recoup by selling it used. Comparing the cost of insurance for gas-powered cars versus EVs helps me understand cost tradeoffs but it's not the most important thing. More important than whether Car A is more expensive than Car B is whether I can afford to pay for the car. So long as premiums stay reasonable I'll pay them."

Mark FitzPatrick has taken over as chief executive of Britain's biggest wealth manager St. James's Place after getting the regulatory greenlight to succeed outgoing Andrew Croft.

FitzPatrick who joins after six years with FTSE 100 insurer Prudential most recently as interim chief executive officially took charge of SJP on Friday morning.

But FitzPatrick joins after a tough year for the wealth manager and will be tasked with taking on a flagging share price uncertainty about the impact of its charging model and investor unrest over bumper pay packages for executives.

This is Money looks at the key issues FitzPatrick will have to tackle.

Share price spiral

SJP shares have fallen by more than 40 per cent since the start of the year at 651.4p some 60 per cent below the group's peak of 1683.5p in December 2021.

The firm enjoyed bumper inflows from the start of the pandemic as lockdown-stricken investors put excess savings to work with assets under management soaring from £117billion at the end of 2019 to £148.4billion by the end of 2022.

While SJP was not alone in taking record inflows among the asset and wealth management sector the group was rewarded with share price gains of nearly 140 per cent between April 2020 and December 2021.

More difficult economic conditions however have taken their toll on the sector with nervous and cash-strapped investors heading for the exit and volatile markets hurting returns.

SJP still managed to grow assets to £157.5billion by 30 June but investor sentiment towards the sector has taken its toll.

UBS says SJP is undervalued Analysts at UBS say SJP's share price 'screens cheap'. The bank said in October: 'Significant EPS cuts long-term fee pressure and a high cost of equity reflecting uncertainty under a new charging structure already appear priced in. 'Significant long-term growth prospects (up to 24 per per annum) do not appear to be reflected in the valuation.' Target price: 735p <!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/mx/money/moneymarkets/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - ->

Charging model shake-up

A far more notable impact on SJP's share price has been the fallout of new consumer duty rules for investment managers in the UK.

When consumer duty which requires all financial services firms to provide 'fair value' and 'timely and clear information' to customers. came into force in July the move forced a share price loss of more than 40 per cent in just one day.

SJP has long faced accusations that it charges excessive or unfair fees to customers for financial advice and early withdrawals.

Its solution to this revealed in October was to scrap exit fees for new bond and pension investments for the 'vast majority' of accounts.

The move which is set to cost the firm around £150million when the changes come into effect in 2025 caused a second sharp share price decline.

However analysis has suggested some SJP pensions customers will end up paying even more under the new model.

Investor pressure on remuneration

SJP has been forced to defend its decision not to cut share awards for top staff last year after a mini investor revolt over its remuneration policy.

Its decision not to cut share awards for top staff last year after a mini investor revolt over its remuneration policy.

But SJP which has suffered a heavy share price slump this year told investors on Wednesday that reducing the firm's long-term incentive plan 'risked damaging the credibility of it'.

The group claimed it was 'grateful' for the feedback from investors and said it would keep shareholders' views on the issue 'in mind' in future.

It added: 'The board will continue to engage with shareholders and their representative bodies in line with our normal practice and will reflect their feedback as appropriate in the 2023 Directors' Remuneration Report.

According to SJP's annual report published in March FitzPatrick's predecessor saw his total pay including cash and deferred bonuses slip from £3.6million in 2021 to £3.11million last year.",,,

Patrons shake off large fluffy snowflakes as they settle in for a favorite holiday tradition.

“Christmas in Connecticut” is a new holiday musical based on the 1945 film of the same name. Both stories follow columnist Liz Sandor (Alyse Alan Louis) who dishes out perfect housekeeping cooking and childrearing tips from her idyllic farmhouse in Connecticut.

Only this entire life is complete poppycock. Sandor has never been married or even boiled an egg. This façade created by Sandor and editor Dudley Beecham (RJ Vaillancourt) is forced into reality when publisher Mr. Yardley (Gerry McIntyre) invites war hero and the column’s biggest fan Jefferson Jones (Christian Magby) to spend Christmas with Sandor in Connecticut.

A Hearth from Swirling Blizzards

This stocking is stuffed to the brim with quick retorts holiday tension and more dramatic irony than you can throw a snowball at. It’s a predictable cozy and comfortable Hallmark-style Christmas card with little to say. However what it says it does so with a perfectly tied red and green ribbon.

As is standard with Pioneer Theatre productions the real star of the show is the immaculate set design. While the show really only has three settings — Sandor’s apartment the streets of New York and Beecham’s Connecticut farmhouse — each is gorgeously crafted.

Lex Liang’s scenic and costume design is truly something out of a storybook as buildings tower over a stormy 1940s New York. The Connecticut Cottage feels warm and lived in a true hearth from the blizzards swirling through the window. Frosty tree tops blend with nostalgic bundles of jackets and mittens. The world crafted is one where falling in love is easy. The sets and costumes go miles in helping the performances come to life.

Heavy Snow Light Commentary

The play’s book written by Patrick Pacheco and Erik Forrest Jackson is light and incredibly nostalgic for the time it is based in. An abundance of original songs by Jason Howland and Amanda Yesnowitz do little to enhance character. They mostly serve to bury the lack of story. The tale often brought up comments about feminism unions and sexual equality but does extremely little to explore them with any depth.

We see a feminist spark with Sandor who multiple times invokes the name of Eleanor Roosevelt. However the play uses this more as a namedrop than an actual commentary. We see union sympathizer Victor Beecham (Eric William Morris) briefly state “Unions are going to save this country!” Yet we don’t see much more than simple finger-wagging. Dudley Beecham’s character is queer however “Christmas in Connecticut” opts to refer to him as “someone who wears cravats” and seems absolutely petrified to even say the word “gay.”

So often “Christmas in Connecticut” tiptoes up to the line of having something important to say. Too often unfortunately it cowers behind blanket statements of “don’t hate” instead of exploring the systems that cultivate such sentiments.

Easy and Predictable

This all being said there really isn’t anything wrong with light and easy commentary. Christmas is supposed to be easy and predictable. It’s all about finding the warmest and brightest feelings amidst the coldest and darkest nights.

This surface-level reminder to be kinder and more understanding has its place. Liz Sandor’s story teaches us to self-evaluate and really decide who we want to be. Still I can’t help but feel that an opportunity is missed with its commentary. Christmas because it is a wondrous time is preyed upon by unhealthy traditionalist mentalities about where we should be and where we aren’t.

“Christmas in Connecticut” has the chance to use the holiday as a backdrop to explore the incumbent feminism in the 1940s. It instead chooses to air on the side of frivolity never actually speaking proudly about the things it claims to preach. A kind and sweet frivolity but a frivolity nonetheless.

As the royal red curtains closed the Connecticut Farmhouse audience members smiled kindly and applauded. The show has plenty of laughs fun choreography and sweet moments to keep those of all ages engaged. You may not leave this snow globe of a show edified and changed but you will certainly smile at how pretty it looks.

“Christmas in Connecticut” runs through Dec. 16.

PUC Delays Approval of Rule Change that Penalizes Storage Resources

Commissioner Jimmy Glotfelty argues against energy storage rule change. | Admin Monitor

Texas regulators have delayed approval of a protocol change that would set a controversial state of charge for batteries that one commissioner said is “totally discriminatory.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8wMi91cy9jb3J5LWhpbGwtc2hha2VpcmEtcnVja2VyLW11cmRlci9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFGaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMy8xMi8wMi91cy9jb3J5LWhpbGwtc2hha2VpcmEtcnVja2VyLW11cmRlcg?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Estranged husband accused of murder after missing woman’s body is found in Florida storage unit,"CNN —

The estranged husband of a woman whose body was found in a storage unit in Orange County Florida has been charged with her murder authorities said.

Shakeira Yvonne Rucker a 37-year-old mother of four was reported missing after her family told the Winter Springs Police Department they last saw her on November 11 CNN previously reported.

Rucker’s family reported she left her home for “an unknown destination” possibly with her estranged husband Cory Hill police said at the time.

Florida law enforcement officials last month said her disappearance was being investigated as a homicide after her body was found in a storage unit registered to Hill.

“The Office of the State Attorney for the Ninth Judicial Circuit has formally filed charges against Cory Hill for the murder of Shakeira Rucker” prosecutors said in a statement Friday. “Hill remains in jail under a no bond status stemming from his November arrest of Attempted Second Degree Murder and other charges against his ex-girlfriend and her family.”

Cory Hill Orange County Jail

Hill 51 was booked in the Orange County Jail on November 13 for an unrelated shooting CNN previously reported. He was charged with four counts of attempted murder after allegedly shooting at a former girlfriend and her family on November 12 according to Orange County Sheriff John Mina.

“Hill now faces an additional charge of Second Degree Murder (With a Firearm) for the death of Ms. Rucker” prosecutors said Friday. “Ms. Rucker’s body was found in a self-storage facility at 2400 Wiggins Road in Apopka after someone complained about a smell coming from inside a unit registered to Cory Hill.”

When deputies opened the unit they found a woman later identified as Rucker dead from apparent gunshot wounds Mina said.

Rucker’s family has set up a GoFundMe page for her four children ages 7 through 18.

Prosecutors said they will seek a first-degree murder indictment in Rucker’s homicide.

“Due to procedural rules the State is limited to filing a Second-Degree Murder charge by Information prior to presenting the case to the Orange County Grand Jury” the statement said.

CNN has reached out to the public defender listed as legal representation for Hill for comment.

The residents who oppose a plan to let heavy industry use Lake Maurepas as a storage site for carbon dioxide emissions span the spectrum of race class age education level and political affiliation.

Chemical giant Air Products wants to drill wells in Lake Maurepas to inject 5 million tons of carbon dioxide per year about a mile below the lakebed. It’s part of a $4.5 billion hydrogen manufacturing complex in adjacent Ascension Parish that would use carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology to pipe air pollution under the lake rather than release it into the atmosphere.

If successful the project would allow Air Products to produce “blue hydrogen” a cleaner alternative to natural gas and other fossil fuels that petrochemical manufacturers burn to make their products.

It’s also cleaner than the common production of hydrogen fuel called “gray hydrogen” which is derived from natural gas in a chemical process that emits large amounts of methane a potent greenhouse gas.

Blue hydrogen production relies on carbon capture technology to trap and store the carbon waste deep underground. “Green hydrogen” is considered the cleanest form and is produced through electrolysis powered by renewable energy sources such as solar or wind. All three fuels are chemically the same and differ only in how they are produced.

An increasing number of residents in Tangipahoa Livingston and St. John the Baptist parishes see the Air Products project as little more than profiteering and reckless industrialization of an iconic lake they say has only recently begun to recover after generations of ecological destruction.

Kim Coates who lives in Tangipahoa Parish has been strongly opposed to the project and made it one of the central issues in her recent campaign for the District 73 seat in the Louisiana House of Representatives which she won. In an interview Thursday she said Air Products’ Lake Maurepas project is just about the most universally hated idea in southeast Louisiana.

Taxpayers have invested millions into restoring Lake Maurepas’ ecosystem and some of those efforts have so far proven successful she said.

The greater Lake Pontchartrain Basin which includes Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas is one of the largest estuaries and home to one of the largest contiguous forests in the country. But its fragile ecosystem has suffered from human activities such as oil and gas exploration logging levees along the Mississippi River and the introduction of invasive species according to studies from the Nature Conservancy and the Southeast Louisiana University Wetlands Restoration Laboratory among others.

Some recovery efforts began in the 1990s including a drilling moratorium in Lake Pontchartrain and a prohibition on dredging in both lakes. More recently the Lake Pontchartrain Basin Restoration Program is a federal initiative that received $10 million in annual funding from President Joe Biden’s 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law

“We’ve put millions and millions of dollars into restoration to protect that ecosystem and you’re gonna turn around and undo it?” Coates said.

Other area residents have voiced similar sentiments at public meetings throughout the year most recently Wednesday at the latest hearing of the Louisiana Senate’s Task Force on Local Impacts of Carbon Capture and Sequestration. The panel is charged with gathering information and making legislative recommendations to lawmakers.

Laurie Sagnibene a Baton Rouge resident with a house on the Tickfaw River which drains into Lake Maurepas was one of many who voiced opposition to the project.

“Air Products claims they want to be a good neighbor protect the lake” Sagnibene said. “If you want to protect the lake leave it alone.”

Several expressed concern over the risks and uncertainties surrounding CO2 pipelines and CCS technologies that remain largely untested at large scale. Those same concerns are shared among the scientific and environmental communities.

Such projects can be very costly and have resulted in dangerous accidents such as the Feb. 22 2020 explosion of a CO2 pipeline in Satartia Mississippi. The incident led to a mass poisoning that hospitalized at least 45 residents and forced more than 200 to evacuate the small rural community.

Several residents referred to the Satartia incident when they addressed the task force. They pointed out how the first responders also became victims when they tried to drive into the area and were stranded because the large carbon dioxide cloud deprived their emergency vehicles of oxygen critical to the operation of combustion engines. Some struggled to breath and passed out.

Springfield resident Mindy Starkey has a family camp about 500 yards from Lake Maurepas.

“What happens when there’s a malfunction an explosion?” she said. “What happens to me and my grandchildren when we’re down at our camp?”

Others are not strictly opposed to CCS and are more worried about property values and the general environmental impacts to the lake.

“We’re not against carbon capture statewide but we are against it in Lake Maurepas” said Bill Whittington founder of the Lake Maurepas Preservation Society.

Many of the residents pointed out that the only support for the project has come from lobbyists and people who have a vested financial interest in it. Ahead of this year’s regular legislative session Air Products hired 25 lobbyists to help secure its project and fend off any adverse legislation — a campaign that paid off. Every bill that tried to halt or slow down the Lake Maurepas project failed to gain traction.

The company also hired Gov. John Bel Edwards’ former spokesperson Christina Stephens. The outgoing governor has been a vocal proponent of carbon capture as a key vehicle to reach his goal to make Louisiana a carbon neutral state by 2050.

Gifford Briggs Gulf Coast region director for the American Petroleum Institute told the Illuminator any characterization of carbon capture as a “new technology” is a false narrative. It has been used for several years with only the storage component being a relatively recent development he said.

Despite increasing public opposition Air Products’ Lake Maurepas proposal has so far sailed smoothly through the state’s regulatory hurdles. The company has brought drilling rigs into the lake to drill test wells after conducting controversial seismic testing earlier this year.

Carbon capture has powerful backers such as the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry one of the most influential lobby groups in the state. Big oil and industrial companies see the technology as a possible lifeline during the energy transition.

A spokesperson for Gov.-elect Jeff Landry declined to offer any insights on Landry’s opinion of the project although he said last month that efforts to achieve carbon neutral status in Louisiana shouldn’t be at the expense of oil and gas industry progress.

State Rep. Valarie Hodges R-Denham Springs also attended Wednesday’s task force meeting. She said Air Products should try to relocate its project somewhere else in Louisiana where it will have a lesser impact on the environment and people. Hodges won election to the Louisiana Senate in October.

“We’re asking: Can these companies — Oxy and Air Products — consider a different location that does not have such a dramatic impact on our way of life?” Hodges said.

When several residents expressed despair over state regulators ignoring or dismissing their concerns Hodges reassured them the task force is listening and will have significant influence with the legislature.

The resolution that formed the task force touts the “massive” economic potential of CCS and notes that “Louisiana is blessed with a world-class volume of available pore space for storage … ideally positioning the state for development of the CCS sector into the future.” Sen. Heather Cloud R-Turkey Creek authored the resolution that claims CCS would help “improve the state’s environment.”

So far opposition from neighbors has not prompted Air Products to change its Lake Maurepas plans or consider moving to a new area.

Air Products plans to apply for another drilling permit in the coming months if its test well data indicates pore space below the lake is suitable for storing CO2 spokesperson Stephens said.

“We remain committed to the Lake Maurepas community and to ongoing outreach and education with the public residents and local officials” Stephens said.

She also touted the company’s recently launched Lake Maurepas Community Fund an annual commitment of $1 million to fund community projects while its CCS project is in operation. Air Products anticipates using the site for at least 25 years.

The company has also funded $9.9 million in research at Southeastern Louisiana University which has launched the Lake Maurepas Monitoring Project to monitor its health Stephens said.

(CBS) – A man was arrested after crashing into a building while driving under the influence in Beach Park Sunday morning.

Around 3 a.m. Lake County Sheriff's deputies responded to a business in the 37000 block of North Sheridan Road for a traffic crash.

Arriving deputies located a Chevrolet Silverado that had caught fire. Good Samaritans helped pull the driver and a passenger from the vehicle before the deputies arrived the sheriff's office said.

Lake County Sheriff's Office

Initial reports said the Chevrolet driven by Roy R. Montoya-Medina 23 of Waukegan was traveling eastbound on Blanchard Road at a high rate of speed.

For an unknown reason Montoya-Medina left the roadway drove through a grassy area and struck the south side of a self-storage building. The Chevrolet caught fire after hitting the building.

Montoya-Medina and his passenger a 25-year-old man from Antioch were taken to an area hospital with serious injuries including serious burns.

Deputies determined that Montoya-Medina was driving under the influence of alcohol the office said.

He was subsequently cited with DUI-alcohol and reckless driving and is required to appear in court on Jan. 24 2024.

Building inspectors responded to the scene to determine the building's structural integrity."

As a result the fastest 5G experience that most consumers are familiar with is the fast but not the fastest connection to carriers' mid-band signals. While no one is complaining some of the amazing things that we were expecting from 5G such as self-driving vehicles and operations performed remotely have yet to be offered to the general public.





Power On Even though the 5G era still has several years remaining Apple is looking ahead at 6G. According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman writing in the last edition of his weeklynewsletter Apple has posted a job listing on the company website that says ""As a Cellular Platform Architect you will drive and coordinate the design and modeling of a 6G reference architecture."" But as Gurman writes the 5G era is expected to run to 2030. So don't start tossing those 5G-enabled phones because there is a long way to go before we start talking about 6G constantly.





What we can still bring up often is Apple's attempt to stop relying on Qualcomm by developing its own 5G modem for the iPhone. In September Apple renewed its expiring contract with Qualcomm and the latter will continue to supply Apple with 5G modems through 2026 . Apple had hoped to have its own 5G modem working inside at least the Pro versions of its smartphone line this year but it has not been able to finish development of this key component.









Gurman brings up some good points about Apple's attempt to build its own 5G modem chip some of which we have expressed ourselves. One of course is Apple's desire to end its reliance on Qualcomm considering that there have been several legal issues between the firms over the years including accusations of patent infringement and more. Apple has a lot riding on this considering how big a role the modem plays on the iPhone.





Apple hopes that in addition to ending its reliance on Qualcomm for this key iPhone part designing and building its own modem would allow the company to develop special technology and features developed for the iPhone. It also would allow Apple to save some money since it wouldn't need to pay Qualcomm both its licensing fee and the price of the chips (remember Qualcomm's ""no license no chips"" policy).

There are several reasons for this with one of them being that Samsung was not aggressive with its 3nm chip production push forcing Qualcomm to source them from a single foundry for next year. In short San Diego’s dual-sourcing strategy will have to wait another year.

A dual-sourcing strategy would have meant lowered production costs and improved availability for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 4

Pushing the boundaries of smartphone chipset development enables companies like Qualcomm to produce silicon that touts incredible power efficiency while delivering impressive performance gains. Unfortunately these perks come at a production cost spike and with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 already said to be more expensive than the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 thanks to its custom Oryon cores using a single foundry will not benefit any of Qualcomm’s partners.

According to TrendForce with 100 percent of chipset orders going to TSMC Qualcomm has delayed its dual-sourcing strategy to 2025 when it is slated to announce the Snapdragon 8 Gen 5. It was previously rumored that there would be two variants of the Snapdragon 8 Gen 4; a regular version and one catered for Samsung’s Galaxy S lineup that would sport the name Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 for Galaxy and mass produced on Samsung’s 3nm GAA process.

However a previous report stated that for Samsung even to receive Snapdragon 8 Gen 4 orders from Qualcomm it would require its foundry’s 3nm yields to reach a minimum of 70 percent. Given that Samsung does not share the same focus as TSMC to pursue more clients for its cutting-edge node it has once again lost out on a lucrative opportunity. Fortunately with Qualcomm continuing its pursuit of a dual-sourcing strategy we could see Samsung return as a supplier in the near future.

``Refind Self: Personality diagnosis game'' play review that allows you to diagnose the player's personality from all actions such as ``picking up items'' and ``attacking NPCs'' playable on PC iOS and Android





Even when playing the same game the play style changes depending on the player's personality such as ``Let's attack NPCs for money'' or ``Let's do less exploration and just proceed with the main quest.'' ' Refind Self: Personality Diagnosis Game ' is a game that focuses on 'personality reflected in play style' and uses 'personality diagnosis' as its theme and you can enjoy a unique game experience that is like a combination of an adventure game and a personality diagnosis. That's what he said. A trial code for such 'Refind Self: Personality Diagnosis Game' was sent to me by indie game publisher PLAYISM so I actually played it to see what kind of game it is.



Refind Self: Personality diagnosis game | Game | PLAYISM official website



'Refind Self: Personality Diagnosis Game' is a game that allows you to diagnose the player's personality based on their actions in the game. Through 30 minutes to several hours of gameplay players can learn which personality suits them among 23 different personalities including ``Planner'' ``Samurai'' ``Philosopher'' and ``Martial Artist.''





At the start of the game players will visit a mysterious cafe-like location and take on a ``personality test game that exists within the game.''











The start screen of the 'personality diagnosis game that exists in the game' is below. It suddenly starts with the line ``The doctor has died.'' The player controls a humanoid robot with a spring on its back and explores the stages while investigating in-game objects and talking with NPCs.







There was a gravestone set up at the game's starting point so I investigated it.







Then a notification saying ``The grave was investigated first'' and ``Clergy [+4]'' were displayed at the top left of the screen. The ``personality diagnosis game that exists in the game'' is a system in which points are added according to the player's actions and are used to diagnose the player's personality. The heart on the left side has '1%' written on it and when this heart reaches 100% the personality test result will be displayed.







The personality test reflects all kinds of actions during play such as ``time spent sitting on the bench'' and ``number of times you investigated objects.''







Investigating objects may also present you with options.







When you select one you will accumulate personality points depending on your choice and the 'selection rate by players around the world' will be displayed next to the choice.







While playing you will see a ``memory scene between the robot and the doctor'' and find ``information left behind by the doctor.'' The story in the game is only told in fragments until the end of the game so players can enjoy guessing events in the game's world from fragments of information.











The personality test is complete when the hearts reach 100%.







This time in order to find out what kind of game 'Refind Self: Personality Diagnosis Game' is I researched every object in the game which led me to be diagnosed as a 'researcher'.







``Refind Self: Personality Diagnosis Game'' allows you to diagnose 5 types of personality: ``The personality that most symbolizes you'' ``The personality that complements you (2 types)'' ``Your hidden personality'' and ``The personality that is farthest from you.'' . Of these ``Your hidden personality'' can be diagnosed by completing the second round and ``Character farthest from you'' by completing the third round.







In fact this element of ``diagnosing your personality by playing multiple times'' is also related to the basis of the story. By playing multiple times you can not only learn more about your personality but also be able to immerse yourself more deeply in the story.







◆Various characters and mini games exist

In the game a wide variety of characters appear including ``Kibo'' who explodes and scatters after helping the player and ``Fortune-telling type'' who predicts the future.











Also character conversations may develop into mini-games.







There are a wide variety of mini-games including ``a game where you serve coffee according to customer orders'' and ``slot machines.''











Depending on your conversation choices a command battle may occur. 'Refind Self: Personality Diagnosis Game' is a game that is based on repeating the game but the game experience changes greatly depending on conversation choices and actions so I was able to play the game repeatedly without getting bored.







In addition 'Refind Self: Personality diagnosis game' can be played on PC iOS and Android. You can access the sales page for each platform using the links below.

That sale reduced their total holding by 11% which is hardly insignificant but far from the worst we've seen.

Ralph Lauren Insider Transactions Over The Last Year

Notably that recent sale by Halide Alagoz is the biggest insider sale of Ralph Lauren shares that we've seen in the last year. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table even below the current price of US$134. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. Please do note however that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 11%of Halide Alagoz's holding.

Does Ralph Lauren Boast High Insider Ownership?

For a common shareholder it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Ralph Lauren insiders own about US$2.6b worth of shares (which is 31% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.

So What Does This Data Suggest About Ralph Lauren Insiders?

An insider sold Ralph Lauren shares recently but they didn't buy any. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort over the last year. On the plus side Ralph Lauren makes money and is growing profits. The company boasts high insider ownership but we're a little hesitant given the history of share sales. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted you should be aware of.

This pattern of behavior could suggest that the insider is diversifying their investment portfolio or realizing gains rather than reflecting a negative outlook on the company's future.

When examining the relationship between insider transactions and stock price it is noteworthy that Ralph Lauren Corp's shares were trading at $127.13 on the day of Alagoz's recent sale. This price gives the stock a market cap of $8.636 billion with a price-earnings ratio of 17.07. This ratio is lower than the industry median of 18.96 and also lower than the company's historical median price-earnings ratio indicating that the stock may be undervalued compared to its peers and its own historical standards.

Furthermore with a price of $127.13 and a GuruFocus Value of $130.29 Ralph Lauren Corp has a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.98. This suggests that the stock is Fairly Valued based on its GF Value. The GF Value is a proprietary intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus which considers historical trading multiples a GuruFocus adjustment factor and future business performance estimates.

The insider trend image above provides a visual representation of the insider transactions over the past year. The absence of insider buys and the presence of five insider sells could indicate a trend where insiders are choosing to liquidate some of their holdings. However without additional insider buys it is challenging to establish a definitive correlation between insider selling and the company's stock price performance.

The GF Value image above illustrates the stock's valuation in relation to its intrinsic value. The close proximity of the current stock price to the GF Value indicates that the market is pricing Ralph Lauren Corp's shares in alignment with their estimated true worth.

Conclusion

Halide Alagoz's recent sale of 3950 shares of Ralph Lauren Corp is a transaction that warrants attention. While insider sales can sometimes raise concerns among investors it is crucial to analyze these actions within the broader context of the company's financial health and market valuation. With Ralph Lauren Corp's stock being fairly valued and the price-earnings ratio suggesting a potential undervaluation investors may find this an opportune time to assess the company's prospects. As always insider transactions are just one piece of the puzzle and a comprehensive analysis should include a review of the company's financials market position and growth potential.

Kickoff is set for 6:30 p.m. and the game will be televised nationally on ESPN.

The bowl invitation is the 46th in Georgia Tech history which is the 16th-most in college football history and the third-most for a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (behind only Clemson – 50 and Florida State – 49). With a 25-20 all-time record in bowl games Tech is tied for 13th all-time in bowl victories and stands alone in 13th all-time in bowl winning percentage (.556).

The Yellow Jackets are making their first-ever appearance in the Gasparilla Bowl which originated in 2008. The Jackets are also facing UCF for the first time in a bowl but the sixth time overall. Georgia Tech owns a 3-2 against UCF but the Golden Knights have won the last two games in the series in 2020 and 2022.

Georgia Tech earned its first bowl berth since 2018 after finishing 6-6 in the regular season including a 5-3 mark in ACC play. The Yellow Jackets tied for fourth place in the ACC standings after being picked to finish 12th in the conference’s preseason poll. The Jackets have been especially potent on offense ranking among the top five in the ACC in rushing (first – 197.1 ypg) total offense (third – 429.1 ypg) scoring offense (fourth – 31.2 ppg) and passing efficiency (fifth – 139.80).

Tech’s offense is led by redshirt-sophomore quarterback Haynes King (2755 passing yards 648 rushing yards 26 touchdown passes nine touchdown runs) who is one of only two players in the nation with at least 2700 passing yards 600 rushing yards 25 touchdown passes and five touchdown runs this season joining LSU’s Jayden Daniels. The Jackets’ offense also features redshirt-sophomore running back Jamal Haynes a third-team all-ACC selection who ranks fifth in the league with 931 rushing yards this season and is on the verge of becoming Tech’s first 1000-yard rusher since 2017.

Defensively Tech ranks 13th nationally in takeaways (23) and fumble recoveries (10) and 20th in interceptions (13). Leading the way is redshirt-senior defensive back and second-team all-ACC honoree Jaylon King who ranks 16th nationally in interceptions (4) and 17th in fumble recoveries (2) to go along with 68 tackles eight pass breakups and a blocked kick.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lnd0c3AuY29tL2FydGljbGUvc3BvcnRzL25jYWEvbmNhYWYvbHN1LXdpc2NvbnNpbi0yMDI0LXJlbGlhcXVlc3QtYm93bC82Ny04NGM4YmFhMi02YmU2LTQ4MGMtYmZhMC1lYTIzMGRlZjUyMzLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,LSU Wisconsin to compete in 2024 ReliaQuest Bowl: What you need to know,"This marks the third ReliaQuest Bowl appearance for LSU and the sixth for Wisconsin.

Sycom Plans On Making Noctua Cooling a Norm In The GPU Industry Operational Noise Levels Are Quite Amazing

For those unaware Sycom has a knack for integrating Noctua's fans into its GPUs since the company has already released the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 & RTX 4060 Ti GPUs with Noctua-powered cooling. This time the company has decided to go one step ahead by transitioning their design language into the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti and by the looks of it the company has been successful in doing so.

2 of 9

The overall color scheme in the ""Noctua"" inspired Ada Lovelace GPUs by Sycom has been consistent throughout and you can't argue about it judging by the fact that not only is the design minimalistic but it has no sort of ""flashy"" RGB lightning make it the best option for those who are into the theme. Moreover the utilization of Noctua fans enhances the aesthetics a lot since the touch of beige and brown just makes things better.

Sycom isn't the first one to introduce Noctua fans into their GPUs since the tradition was started by none other than ASUS which had unveiled both RTX 30 and RTX 40 series variants in the past. However the difference with Sycom is that the Japanese firm has managed to limit the slot size of the Noctua-equipped GPUs to some extent making them a viable option for those who don't want massively sized heatsinks.

Image Credits: Sycom

For a bit of a technical rundown the Sycom GeForce RTX 4070 Ti comes with Noctua's NF-A12x25 PWM fans which are the same ones that we find in other models from the company. To support all of the integrated stuff the GPU comes with a metallic housing frame which is ""hand-made"" and developed by Nagao Industry. Another interesting fact is that the company is offering ""noise audio samples"" to its potential consumers to let them know about how capable the GPU is when it comes to operating ""quietly"".

The disappointing factor is that Sycom's GPU models aren't available separately rather they are integrated into pre-built systems. There is no word on global availability as well which potentially limits the scope of the GPU in terms of consumer exposure and sales.

VIEW GALLERY - 6 IMAGES

Sycom has already launched its RTX 4070 and RTX 4060 Ti Silent Master graphics cards with each card featuring an individual cooling design but they're all using Noctua fans. This means we get a chunky heatsink and dual Noctua fans that make for a huge quad-slot design but that thermal system is worth it if you want virtually silent operation from the card.

Noctua's own black chromax fans are in play here with the iconic brown and beige fan design that sits on top of a huge heatsink on the Sycom RTX 4070 Ti Silent Master. Sycom is using the Noctua NF-A12x25 PVM fans with a custom metal frame that was developed by Nagao Seisakusho with the black frame actually handmade exclusively designed and manufactured.

There's no RGB lighting which I really dig here as this card would look fantastic inside of a beautifully styled gaming PC.

Sycom also makes its own pre-built systems in-house where they've been customizing GeForce RTX series GPUs for a while to use inside of their pre-built systems. You can't buy any of Sycom's custom graphics card designs so their range of Silent Master graphics cards is only available inside of Sycom's own pre-built gaming PCs.

Start the video and you'll see the frame-rate and frame-time play out in real time. Below these stats we have a bar chart that you can hover over to show more stats and click to switch between absolute and relative performance. Mobile users get a more basic view with a table of results.

First up: Cyberpunk 2077. This streaming test used during production remains accessible in the game and offers a good test of both CPU and GPU at its 'Ultra' preset. We've benchmarked at 1440p as this is closest to the Blade 14's native resolution of 2560x1600 but note that we're using the pre-2.0 pre-Phantom Liberty version of the game as this wasn't available during our testing phase.

Note that our only other recent gaming laptop benchmark results are also included for context; these are two 15-inch 2022-era RTX 3060 laptops that retailed for around £1600; by contrast the 2023-era Blade 14 starts at £2500 so it's far from a perfect comparison but hopefully worth including for context. We've also got a desktop RTX 4070 result which relies on a Core i9 12900K and DDR5-6000 - representing pretty much the maximum possible performance from a card with the RTX 4070 descriptor.

The RTX 4070 Laptop GPU and Ryzen 9 7940HS CPU proved quite a potent combo in Cyberpunk 2077 despite the contraints of a 14-inch chassis. The Blade 14 turned in a decent 37fps average at 1440p with neither DLSS 2 nor DLSS 3 frame generation engaged which represents around two-thirds of the performance of the desktop card.

Add in DLSS 2 and you can reach a comfortable 89fps - this is how I'd recommend playing. There's also the option for Frame Generation which pushes the frame-rate to around 107fps in this demanding test. That gives you just about enough leeway to engage the psycho RT mode and still make out with a 59fps average though frame-time health does suffer considerably.

F1 22 is another game that provides a tough GPU challenge even without RT turned on. The Singapore circuit in the rain is the toughest workout we've found so far but the Blade 14 is able to hit an esports-ready 130fps average - around 30fps clear of the larger RTX 3060 machines we tested last year. Compared to the desktop RTX 4070 we're achieving roughly 75 percent of the performance which is pretty good - if not as amazing as the faster-than-desktop performance we recorded with our Chillblast RTX 3060 laptop.

Note that the laptop does suffer from a more dynamic frame-rate with larger dips including some below 60fps while the desktop card doesn't dip as low as 100fps. That contributes to a much smoother feeling on the desktop card though the average frame-rates are reasonably similar.

Finally we do have enough headroom here to engage RT and DLSS 3 frame generation ending up with a 104fps average and slightly better minimum frame-rates - with slightly worse input lag as you'd expect from frame-gen tech.

We tend to think of Far Cry 6 as being a game that is heavy on both CPU and GPU and upgrading both of course leads to better performance from our Razer Blade 14 than the other older laptops we have data for. The 87fps average here is a nice 20 percent boost over the faster of the two RTX 3060 laptops and again gives us the headroom to engage RT without losing our in-excess-of-60fps average. Frame-time health does suffer as a result so playing without RT may be preferable even on a £2500 laptop.

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive tested here in its DX9 iteration rather than the Vulkan-based Counter-Strike 2 follow-up is of course much more CPU-limited. Here we see our first win for the Intel-powered Chillblast machine which is able to achieve a higher frame-rate - although it does show more frame-time variance than the newer Ryzen 9 7940HS contender. Still with CS:GO now shelved in favour of Counter-Strike 2 this comparison is largely academic - and we'll have to come with a new benchmark for future testing!

Modern Warfare 2's built-in benchmark is a little harder to find these days with the whole app having been renamed 'Call of Duty' on Steam and the benchmark itself having been relocated to the submenu of a submenu but the results are what matters - and here the RTX 4070 is able to stretch its legs with a comfortable 157fps average result allowing you to take good advantage of that 1440p screen even on balanced settings. Note that DLSS is engaged here in its balanced mode so aiming for 240Hz requires dropping fidelity further.

Our final game of Company of Heroes 3 shows another nice increase in frame-rate in exchange for our newer and higher-tier CPU/GPU combo. A 136fps average is still great for an RTS like CoH and FSR2 quality mode is available to push this to 152fps if you want a slightly smoother experience in exchange for a slightly fuzzier resolve.

O,Realty Income,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAyL3JlYWx0eS1pbmNvbWUtZXhwZWN0cy1ncm93LXdpdGhvdXQtc2VsbGluZy1zdG9jay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Realty Income Expects to Grow 4% to 5% Without Selling Stock in 2024,"Realty Income is setting itself up for a strong 2024 and it won't need to resort to selling stock while the share price is weak.

The drastic and quick rise in interest rates has pushed investors away from income-focused investments like real estate investment trusts (REITs). A certificate of deposit yielding 5% is too big a draw for some given there's no need to take on the risk of owning stocks involved. But that's a problem for REITs which depend on the capital markets for funding. Realty Income (O 0.22%) thinks it will be able to grow adjusted funds from operations (FFO) between 4% and 5% next year just the same. Here's what's going on.

REITs are designed to pay dividends

As a way to give individual investors access to institutional-level income properties REITs are allowed to avoid corporate-level taxes. The catch is that they must pay out at least 90% of taxable earnings as dividends though most REITs pay out much more than that. Essentially most of the cash a REIT generates goes toward dividends. That leaves these companies highly reliant on the capital markets when it comes to raising money to pay for buying new properties.

That's a big problem right now because interest rates have risen dramatically over the past year or so. Thus issuing debt has become much more expensive. And with the broader REIT sector falling thanks partly to investors shifting to other income options (like high-yield CDs) selling stock isn't all that attractive either. It's a problem for the entire sector that will take time to even out with property prices likely to adjust so that acquisitions are attractive even with higher rates. That probably won't happen until there's more pain among property sellers which normally comes from debt issues (like the rollover of lower-cost debt to current interest rates).

Realty Income is a good example. While off from its low the stock price is still down more than 25% from its 2022 highs. The dividend yield which was around 4% at one point now hovers around 5.7%. That's a small change on an absolute basis but a huge 40% increase in the yield on a percentage basis. Using the yield as a rough gauge of equity capital costs selling stock has clearly become much less desirable for Realty Income.

Realty Income is on track for a solid year

One positive thing here is that Realty Income isn't known for its rapid growth. Slow and steady is the norm. So the hurdle that Realty Income has to jump for Wall Street is modest. And as noted the company is already telling investors that 4% to 5% growth in adjusted funds from operations is in the cards in 2024. Normally a company wouldn't provide that kind of guidance until early in 2024 when they report full-year 2023 earnings.

But there's a slightly different dynamic at Realty Income as it enters 2024. It is set to buy peer Spirit Realty (SRC) in an all-stock transaction. This is a $9.3 billion acquisition so it will go a long way toward the growth plans that Realty Income is working on for next year. The company expects it to be immediately accretive to adjusted FFO. This is why Realty Income CEO Sumit Roy was happy to (repeatedly) highlight the adjusted FFO growth he expects next year during Realty Income's third-quarter earnings call:

I think if you look at where we are today and you look a year ahead in 2024 we believe that without having to rely on the equity capital markets we'll be able to deliver approximately 4% to 5% AFFO per share growth. And that is a pretty powerful statement to make and that obviously assumes that the Spirit transaction closes either in the first month either in January or in February. And with just the free cash flow that we are going to generate pro forma which is going to be right around $800 million some of the headwinds that we are going to experience in the refinancing absorbing all of that to be able to sit here today and say that we could deliver that growth without having to raise $1 of equity I think it's a very good place to be.

It is a very good place to be since selling stock today is far more expensive than it was just a year or so ago. More importantly the REIT is buying time for the property markets to adjust and for Wall Street's view of REITs to improve. That's already starting to happen with Realty Income as its stock has begun to inch higher after hitting a low point in late October. But there's still a lot more room for recovery.

Realty Income isn't exciting but it is reliable

Realty Income has increased its dividend annually for 29 consecutive years. The rate of dividend growth was a modest 4.3% or so per year over that span. This isn't the type of stock you brag about to friends but it is one you can count on to keep paying you through good times and bad ones. Right now is a bad time in the REIT sector but Realty Income is openly telling investors that it can handle the headwinds. If you are looking to create a reliable income stream you might want to jump aboard this well-positioned REIT while the shares are still depressed.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Working closely with stakeholders including the district medical officers community leaders and health promotion outlets the health services provided included cervical cancer screening for women medical services optometry services and pediatric services. The service reached over 300 people within 3 days in the Mkuranga Hospital.

Speaking at the screening exercise Dr Iriya Nemes Joseph Programme Officer at WHO noted the unwavering commitment and support of WHO in supporting the Government in achieving the universal health coverage agenda.

“The health outreach programme comes at an opportune time and aligns significantly with WHO’s call for health for all” noted Dr Iriya. “This partnership will help to address diseases to ultimately contribute to saving lives and livelihoods.”

This health outreach programme forms part of an overall vision of ensuring universal health coverage for all in Tanzania. This constitutes people having access to the full range of quality health services they need when and where they need them without financial hardship

On his part Dr Daedong Kim Team lead from KOICA expressed the pleasure of KOICA to partner with WHO and acknowledged the efforts of partners and Korean volunteers in supporting Tanzania’s public health priority.

“This initiative will strengthen healthcare systems and empower the local communities” he stated. “We are indeed happy to be serving the people of Tanzania and KOICA is committed to the health agenda on the country”.

This pilot initiative is set to take place across the country targeting hard-to-reach areas in the country. The first section was also supported by Vision Care.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWVtYW5qb3VybmFsLm5ldC9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLW5ld3MvMjAyMy8xMi9yZWN5Y2xpbmctaXMtY2hhbmdpbmctaW4td2Vic3Rlci1jaXR5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Recycling is changing in Webster City | News Sports Jobs,"First of a series.

Today a new era of recycling begins in Webster City and you get to use that new 64-gallon green (with blue lid) recycling cart delivered to your home by The Trash Man recently.

The old green bin is yours to keep and use as you wish but from now on only the new carts can be used for recycling. The Daily Freeman Journal sat down with Trash Man General Manager Chris Kehoe to learn how curbside recycling will change in Webster City.

Read on to learn what’s happening why it’s happening and how to improve your own recycling efforts.

Curbside recycling began in Webster City April 1 1992 with only No. 1 plastics (milk jugs) No. 2 plastics (dark plastic bottles) newsprint metals and clear glass accepted.

A year later The Daily Freeman Journal reported 1.1 million pounds were collected the first 12 months of the program; that is about 12 pounds per resident. Neil Wright then-recycling coordinator for The Trash Man told the paper “we’re seeing a good response; people are working at this.”

From that time to this residents put recycling in small green open-top bins.

Today Webster City joins a nationwide trend of “single-stream recycling” that began more than 30 years ago in larger cities and is now moving into smaller cities and rural areas.

How does it work?

From now on Webster Citians will put all recyclables in one bin (see the list of accepted materials below) and wheel the bin to the curb positioning it with wheels facing your house. A new truck specially equipped for automated collection stops next to the cart extends squeezer-arms to lift the cart and tip its contents into the truck. It’s all done by one person who never leaves the cab of the truck. Previously two employees were required to pick up recycling: a driver and a sorter.

Kehoe explained single stream is now the “industry standard in recycling” saying “it’s a pure labor cost and efficiency situation.”

The Trash Man’s new contract with the city which began September 5 2023 and runs five years requires once a week collection of recycling weekdays between 6 a.m. and 4 p.m. — the same day trash is collected — for all residences in Webster City.

Note: Recycling is not collected on New Year’s Day Memorial Day Independence Day Labor Day Thanksgiving Day or Christmas Day. Residents whose collection falls on one of these holidays will have it collected the following business day.

The Trash Man charges the city $3.50 per month per residence for this service. The city bills residents — defined as everyone with a utility meter — $3.75 per month on utility bills.

The city has no thought of profiting from recycling; the over-charge pays for “write-offs” — residents who don’t or are unable to pay their utility bills.

In addition to residential collection the contract requires The Trash Man to maintain “a recyclable container designed and constructed specifically for drop off of recyclable materials.” This facility on East Ohio Street near the City of Webster City Street Department offices and garage is emptied on average every 10 days according to Kehoe.

The multiple-year contract means The Trash Man can justify the considerable outlay necessary to make the conversion to single-stream recycling. The firm spent $285000 for a 2022 Mack LR truck with automatic side loading equipment and more than $250000 for 3500 new 64-gallon green plastic recycling carts. The carts cost The Trash Man $70 each and one has been supplied to each of the 3500 residences in Webster City free of charge.

Where does it go?

A common question according to Kehoe is where does recycled material go?

After collection in Webster City The Trash Man must then market what has been collected to other firms some of which further process the materials and some of which aggregate material into larger lots to sell onward to other companies. These include Waste Management Inc. Des Moines the world’s largest trash and recycling company; Quincy Recycling Quincy Illinois which specializes in newsprint and plastic recycling; and Republic Services Cedar Falls. Most Webster City recyclable material though finds its way to the North Central Iowa Regional Solid Waste Agency in Fort Dodge. Despite its name the agency also recycles materials in Webster and nearby counties.

A key factor in selling recycled materials is the amount of contamination in the final product. This is one of Kehoe’s biggest concerns in the switch to single-stream.

“We’re making it easier for Webster Citians to recycle versus our previous system. All they have to do is put everything in one cart. It’s bigger it’s got a lid to keep the load intact and wheels make it easier to move” he said.

So far so good but there will inevitably be a learning curve as the new carts go into service. Consumers must understand no trash can ever be put into the blue-topped carts. That would contaminate not only the recycled materials but the cart itself.

“For trash we have an identical cart with a green top” Kehoe said. If you pay Trash Man to haul your trash you’ll get two carts; one for trash; the other for recycling.

Transportation

Transport is another factor. It’s not economical to move small loads of recyclables so a minimum load of 40000 pounds — 20 tons — must be accumulated before it can be loaded into a truck. At present it takes two to three months to accumulate residential plastic recycling in Webster City to amass such a load.

In the meantime The Trash Man must store it in its Webster City yard or recycling center.

The Trash Man also has industrial and commercial customers. Prestage Foods Hy Vee Fareway Kwik Star and local restaurants all rely on twice-weekly pick-ups to haul away their recycling.

When asked how many people in Webster City recycle today Kehoe estimated it at about 40%.

A number of cities have seen impressive double-digit gains in citizens participating in recycling after implementing single-stream recycling but also usually increased contamination. Convenience-crazed Americans find single-stream recycling easier and faster but in the end someone somewhere along the chain must separate plastics papers metal and glass.

Larger cities and some recycling firms operate sophisticated automated recycling plants called material recovery facilities. These employ a combination of expensive very sophisticated machinery and large numbers of human sorters to do the job. Such facilities cannot exist without a large steady stream of recyclable material and ready markets for clean bundled recycling.

Costing millions of dollars to build they aren’t yet a viable solution in small rural markets like Webster City or Fort Dodge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMivgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL21hc2Rhci1hbmQtZWRmLXNpZ24tbWFqb3ItYWdyZWVtZW50LXdpdGgtZ292ZXJubWVudC1vZi10aGUta3lyZ3l6LXJlcHVibGljLXRvLWRldmVsb3AtdXAtdG8tMy02Z3ctb2YtaHlkcm9wb3dlci1hbmQtcmVuZXdhYmxlLXByb2plY3RzLTMwMjAwMzkzNS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Masdar and EDF Sign Major Agreement with Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to Develop up to 3.6GW of ...,"Masdar and EDF sign landmark agreement with government of the Kyrgyz Republic to explore development of up to 3.6 gigawatts (GW) of hydro and renewable energy projects

Deal represents Masdar's first entry into the hydropower space

Agreement strengthens existing ties between UAE and the Kyrgyz Republic

DUBAI United Arab Emirates Dec. 3 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company PJSC – Masdar the UAE's clean energy powerhouse and EDF have signed an agreement with the Ministry of Energy of the Kyrgyz Republic to explore the development of hydropower and renewable projects with a combined capacity of up to 3.6 gigawatts (GW).

Masdar and EDF Sign Major Agreement with Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to Develop up to 3.6GW of Hydropower and Renewable Project Masdar and EDF Sign Major Agreement with Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to Develop up to 3.6GW of Hydropower and Renewable Project

The agreement was signed during COP28 in Dubai by Kyrgyz Minister of Energy H.E. Taalaibek Ibraev Masdar Director Development and Investment (EMEA) Ahmed Al Awadi and EDF Assets Development Director for Europe and Central Asia Emmanuelle Chevennement. The signing ceremony was witnessed by the President of the Kyrgyz Republic H.E. Sadyr Japarov UAE Under-Secretary for Energy and Petroleum Affairs at the Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure Sharif Al Olama and EDF Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Luc Remont.

Despite an extensive clean energy portfolio encompassing solar floating solar onshore wind offshore wind floating wind geothermal battery energy storage systems and green hydrogen today's memorandum of understanding (MoU) represents Masdar's first entry into the hydropower space.

Dr Sultan Al Jaber UAE Minister of Industry and Advanced Technology COP28 President and Masdar Chairman said: ""At COP28 it will be incumbent on the world to utilize all clean energy sources at its disposal to keep the ambition of limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C within reach. Hydropower is one of the oldest clean energy sources and has many positive attributes that can help a number of countries around the world achieve their climate goals and meet their net-zero targets.""

H.E. Taalaibek Ibraev Minister of Energy of the Kyrgyz Republic said: ""This agreement serves to further strengthen the existing ties between the Kyrgyz Republic the UAE and France. Hydropower is a very important energy source for the Kyrgyz Republic and this agreement will help our nation to strengthen its existing clean energy supply and to develop projects utilizing other renewable energy sources.""

Masdar Chief Executive Officer Mohamed Jameel Al Ramahi said: ""This agreement represents a new chapter for Masdar in our clean energy journey. With over 17 years of pioneering renewable energy technologies and successfully delivering utility-scale clean energy projects we are glad to have the opportunity to bring the energy passion and focus to hydropower that we have utilized for so many other renewable energy sources as we seek in partnership with EDF to build a successful collaboration with the Kyrgyz Republic deepening the strong relationship between the UAE and the Kyrgyz Republic.""

The Kyrgyz Republic has set a target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 44 percent by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. The country already generates around 90 percent of its electricity from clean energy resources almost exclusively from hydropower plants.

Central Asia is a significant emerging market for Masdar which has several agreements to develop solar and wind projects in the region. As the UAE's clean energy powerhouse and one of the world's fastest growing renewable companies Masdar is at the vanguard of advancing the development and deployment of renewable energy and green hydrogen technologies to address global sustainability challenges.

Established in 2006 Masdar is active in more than 40 countries and has more than 20GW of renewable energy capacity including operational under construction or advanced development projects in its worldwide portfolio. Masdar has invested or committed to invest in worldwide projects with a combined value of more than US$30 billion with ambitious growth plans to reach 100GW of renewable energy capacity and 1 million tonnes of annual green hydrogen production by 2030.

It enables investors to gain exposure to those companies that not only offer attractive growth and returns but that also have long-lasting positive outcomes for both people and planet. The circular economy is a change in economic system. It means moving away from “take-make-waste” practices where we buy things use them and throw them away. Instead a circular system is one where products and materials are kept in use and production follows a sustainable path that reduces consumption of raw materials. The key aim of the circular economy is to decouple economic growth from virgin resource consumption. The simple reason being that the world is running out of resources. We already use 1.7x the resources that the planet naturally regenerates each year and this figure is only going to grow as the global population expands. We are living way beyond our means. Why waste is a valuable resource Waste is generally defined as “material or resources that are discarded unused or considered to be of no value”. However waste is but a lack of imagination. There is very little ‘waste’ in the modern world that is of no value; it is more about having the right infrastructure regulations and will to capture that value. This gives us hope that we can improve current waste management practices. We currently sit at a powerful intersection of forces – affordable and efficient technology supportive regulations and consumer and business demand – that will work to improve circularity. There are many sources of waste. In this piece we will focus on municipal solid waste given it’s the area of the waste industry with the best data and which often receives the most attention. What is municipal solid waste (MSW)? MSW is rubbish that comes from households or businesses (restaurants hotels offices). It typically consists of papers plastics discarded food garden waste and other discarded items. The world generates c.2 billion tonnes of MSW annually. This is the equivalent of 111 million rubbish trucks per day. As economies and incomes grow in emerging markets this number is increasing rapidly. By 2050 with a global population of c.10 billion it is expected that the world will produce 3.4 billion tonnes of MSW annually (a 70% increase from today). This however doesn’t tell the entire story as averages often hide the underlying dynamics. On one end of the spectrum you have the North American region with c. 530kg per capita per annum and at the other you’ve got 168kg per capita in sub-Saharan Africa.

The issue therefore is that if everyone in the world produced waste at the same rate as the average person from North America then global waste production would hit c. 4.1 billion tonnes p.a. (or 210 million rubbish trucks per day). Waste generation per capita is very highly correlated with income levels. It is a problem if we cannot decouple economic growth from resource consumption. Countries low on the income scale have ambitions to move up and it is these countries that tend to see the highest growth in populations as well. Why is waste a problem? The biggest issue is how waste is disposed of because that can generate negative impacts on climate change pollution and biodiversity. There is also the issue that by not properly recycling our waste we are creating demand for more virgin resources at a time when we are already over-consuming. We can see from the below chart that the vast majority of waste globally is either openly dumped (c. 33%) or landfilled (c. 37%) with only 19% being either recycled or composted. About 11% of waste is disposed of via incineration (known as waste to energy).",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3dlc3RzZWF0dGxlYmxvZy5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi93ZXN0LXNlYXR0bGUtY3JpbWUtd2F0Y2gtYW5vdGhlci1jcmFzaC1hbmQtZ3JhYi1hdC1jYW5uYS13ZXN0LWN1bHR1cmUtc2hvcC13b3JrLXRydWNrLWJyZWFrLWluL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,WEST SEATTLE CRIME WATCH: Another crash-and-grab at Canna West Culture Shop; work-truck break-in | West ...,"Two incidents in West Seattle Crime Watch this morning:

CRASH-AND-GRAB BURGLARS HIT CANNA WEST AGAIN: Driving in the 5400 block of California SW this morning we saw that damage to Canna West Culture Shop. It happened just before 3 am according to archived dispatch audio – three people crashed a vehicle into the storefront and ran off southbound. The people we talked with say it appears nothing was taken; it should be noted this is NOT where Canna sells cannabis – that’s Canna West Seattle (WSB sponsor) across the street; this shop specializes (as its sign says) in CBD products. Archived audio indicates the burglars left a gray Kia Optima behind still running; it had not (yet) been reported stolen but they were going to check with the registered owner at a North Seattle address. The burglars seen leaving the scene were described only as “three unknown-race males thin.” The same building houses the studio of Filigree and Shadow fragrances (WSB sponsor) which proprietor James tells us was not damaged. The previous crash-and-grab hit at Canna West was in September.

One reader report this morning:

WORK TRUCK BREAK-IN: From Amanda: “I wanted to let you know that there was a truck broken into at the Wells Fargo parking lot in The Junction last night. My friend parked his Republic Services work truck there last night around 6 pm. The robber smashed the window and stole lots of rain gear hoodies and boots. Mostly all with either a US Ecology logo or Republic Services logo. If the community could keep an eye out it would be appreciated!”"

The Jets were penalized 11 times in their 13-8 loss to the Falcons.

A staggering seven of those penalties came in the final four minutes of the first half.

“At the end of the first half [it was] borderline comical” Jets coach Robert Saleh said.

The Jets had four false starts on offense — one each from Carter Warren Joe Tippmann Mekhi Becton and Jeremy Ruckert.

They had an interception by D.J. Reed wiped off the board by an illegal-contact penalty on Reed late in the first half.

Another flag was called on Reed just before halftime this one for unnecessary roughness for a hit on Drake London in the end zone.

“Obviously my intent wasn’t to get any unnecessary roughness penalties” Reed said. “When I looked at the replay though it kind of did look like we went a little helmet to helmet. The NFL is emphasizing that. I might get a fine for that but my intent was not to try to hurt him or anything. It was to just try to knock the ball out.”

Penalties have been an issue the past two months.

Saleh was asked if his team was undisciplined.

“I thought our guys fought hard” Saleh said. “I respect the question I understand the question with regard to penalties and all that but our guys play hard. I’m not going to apologize for their style of play.

“We’ve got to clean up the pre-snap stuff on offense with regard to the usage of cadence. It’s obviously fooling us more than it’s fooling them. It’s stuff we’ve got to get better at.”

The Jets suffered several injuries Sunday.

TE C.J. Uzomah injured his right knee.

Saleh said it is an MCL injury and they will know more Monday.

DT Perrion Winfrey making his Jets debut suffered a foot injury that required him to be carted off.

Saleh said it was “really bad.”

WR Jason Brownlee left the game with an ankle injury.

Last Thursday night half a thousand people gathered at a nightclub in Salt Lake City to hear Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — the controversial environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist the third of late Sen. Bobby Kennedy’s 11 children. Kennedy chose Utah to kick off his campaign for the 2024 presidential race. Minutes before he took the microphone Rufus McGee a 41-year-old financier was cracking open a beer with the attitude of one who expected to witness a spectacle that would cause him a mixture of morbidity and fascination. “Some of his policies are out of touch with reality. He strikes me as a guy who comes from outside the fringes and speaks without much concern for what people will think of him” McGee says.

McGee arrived at Sky nightclub a political orphan. He is one of millions of voters who don’t know who to support in what could be round two between Joe Biden 81 and Donald Trump 77 in 2024. Both McGee and his girlfriend Chris a 45-year-old train engineer are registered Republicans. It’s the only way for their voice to be heard in Utah a state that has voted solidly for moderate Republicans since 1985. The couple has one certainty: they won’t vote for Trump. “There’s just no way” says Christine who describes herself as a liberal.

Against this backdrop Kennedy 69 has emerged as an attractive alternative. He has the surname of one of America’s most prominent political dynasties. However experts on the Kennedy family believe that the does not represent the continuity of what the name symbolizes. A portion of his family members have turned their backs on his aspirations. “He seems more interested in capturing votes from those who believe there was a conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy than in following in the footsteps of President Kennedy and his own father… I can’t help but think that if JFK or his brother RFK were still alive this candidacy would seem horrible to them and they would urge him to drop out of the race” Thomas Maier author of The Kennedys: America’s Emerald Kings (2004) says by e-mail. “Ironically the only way he can help the Democratic Party this year the organization that was a vehicle for his family’s success is to take votes away from Donald Trump from right-wing supporters addicted to conspiracy theories” the author adds.

Amaryllis Fox his campaign manager and daughter-in-law says RFK Jr. leads in preferences among young people. He is especially strong among voters between 18 and 34 years old 38% of whom approve of him according to a Quinnipiac poll. This poll claims that Kennedy would win 22% of the vote if he were to run as an independent candidate in a three-way race (Biden would win 39% and Trump 36%). According to Fox a former CIA agent who published in 2019 a book about her experience his main appeal to this sector is his discourse on the corrupt relationship between the state and corporations.

But there’s more to his candidacy as he sought to convey at the Utah event. For 60 minutes the presidential hopeful jumped from topic to topic with a verbosity worthy of an unmoderated podcast. He began with the homeless crisis in San Francisco; the litigation he has brought against Monsanto; the crisis on the Mexican border; the billions of dollars he believes were wasted during the pandemic; the greed of investment firms BlackRock Blackstone and Vanguard; and the abusive use of dynamite in mining in West Virginia among other topics. In the audience there were people with signs calling for “freedom for the middle class.” One shouted “Give us our country back.”

Kennedy fired on all cylinders on issues that appeal to both the right and the left. To progressives he promised environmentalism. To conservatives less regulation and the closing of government watchdogs. Throughout his chaotic speech hovered a nostalgia for the America that is gone the one his “uncle” helped forge in reference to John F. Kennedy. “The American dream the one you could achieve by working hard and playing by the rules is a promise that can no longer be kept” he said during his speech. “Faith in America has been lost” he said at another point.

“What are we going to do about it?” someone shouted at him from the second floor. Kennedy who has been campaigning for six months seems to focus more on diagnosis than proposals. His team is determined to get him on the ballot in all 50 states across the country. This effort requires an investment of about $15 million explains Amaryllis Fox. That is why Utah was chosen as the starting point. The state has the lowest requirement: he just has to get 1600 signatures by Jan. 8. In states like California the challenge is much greater as he will need at least 1% of the signatures of registered voters that is around 219000 people.

Vivian became a volunteer signature gatherer on Thursday. She is 32 years old and works at an online law firm. She didn’t vote in 2020 having lost faith in American politics when her favorite progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders didn’t become the Democratic nominee. Nor does she plan to vote if Kennedy doesn’t make the ballot. “I’m not willing to choose between the lesser of two evils” she says. That night she attended her first political rally and brought a friend with her. Both were impressed by the range of issues and how he stood up to giants like Monsanto and BlackRock. “I think he can defend us from everything they want to take away from us” she says.

While there is optimism in the RFK Jr. campaign election experts remain skeptical. A reputable group of political scientists at the University of Virginia doubts that the independent will maintain his popularity once the election date approaches. “Third-party candidates have more strength in the polls than in their performance. Voter antipathy toward the two major candidates can artificially boost numbers on paper” writes Kyle Kondik. As an example he cites Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Jill Stein. In the polls heading into the 2016 election they had 9% and 3% of the vote respectively. Then they received only 3.3% and 1.1%. But Kondik issues a warning: “Kennedy’s true support will only be revealed very late in the campaign which makes the polls very difficult to decipher.”

ROK,Rockwell Automation,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy90aGluay1idXlpbmctcm9ja3dlbGwtYXV0b21hdGlvbi1pbmMtMTQzOTM2NzI0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Should You Think About Buying Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK) Now?,"Let's talk about the popular Rockwell Automation Inc. (NYSE:ROK). The company's shares saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE rising to highs of US$317 and falling to the lows of US$257. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Rockwell Automation's current trading price of US$281 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Rockwell Automation’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.

See our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation

What Is Rockwell Automation Worth?

The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 18.89% above my intrinsic value which means if you buy Rockwell Automation today you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $236.75 then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Rockwell Automation’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta which is a good indicator for share price volatility.

Can we expect growth from Rockwell Automation?

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Rockwell Automation's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 33% indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows feeding into a higher share value.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in ROK’s positive outlook with shares trading around its fair value. However there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ROK now may not be the most optimal time to buy given it is trading around its fair value. However the positive outlook is encouraging for the company which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

With this in mind we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks. Every company has risks and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Rockwell Automation you should know about.

Tracee's mother music legend Diana Ross encouraged her children to lean on each other though she always made sure to prioritize her kids amid her busy career.

“It was very clear to me that I was wanted before I got here. To my siblings too — and we’re a very bonded group still"" the black-ish star told The Standard in 2021.

""That there was a space made in the world that she sort of cleaned off"" she continued referencing Diana. ""Her intention was always for us to live our lives from her shoulders. My mom’s career was never more important than her children.""

When Tracee was born in 1972 her mother had already welcomed her eldest daughter Rhonda the year prior. At the time Diana was married to her first husband music executive Robert Ellis Silberstein although Motown legend Berry Gordy was Rhonda’s biological father. Silberstein stepped in to raise Rhonda as his own and after Tracee was born Diana and Silberstein had one more child — Tracee's younger sister Chudney.

After Diana and Silberstein divorced in 1977 she married Norwegian businessman Arne Naess Jr. The couple welcomed two kids less than a year apart making Tracee a big sister to brothers Ross and Evan. Tracee also gained three step-siblings: Naess’ children from a previous relationship Katinka Christoffer and Leona.

The Candy Cane Lane actress credits her famous mother with fostering a tight-knight bond between her and her brothers and sisters which is still apparent to this day. The siblings often spend holidays together and Tracee has thrived in her role as an aunt to her nieces and nephews.

Here’s everything to know about Tracee Ellis Ross’ siblings and their relationship with their actress sister.

While all of Tracee’s siblings share Diana as their mother they have different fathers. Tracee’s eldest sister Rhonda was born on Aug. 14 1971 following Diana’s relationship with Gordy. By the time Rhonda was born Diana and Gordy went their separate ways and her mother married Silberstein.

Despite Rhonda being Gordy’s daughter Silberstein raised her as his own. Diana and Silberstein welcomed two children together — Tracee on Oct. 29 1972 and Chudney on Nov. 4 1975.

After Diana’s split from Silberstein in 1977 a decade passed before she wed again. She tied the knot with Norwegian businessman Naess in 1986 and the pair became parents shortly after. Their son Ross was born on Oct. 7 1987 and Evan arrived less than a year later on Aug. 26 1988.

Diana and Naess ultimately divorced in 2000.

She also has three step-siblings from her mother's previous marriage

When Diana married Naess she became stepmom to his three children from a previous relationship — Katinka Christoffer and Leona.

Although Diana and Naess eventually divorced Tracee is still close with her step-siblings. In 2022 she shared a TikTok in honor of National Sisters Day which included photos of Katinka and Leona as well as Rhonda and Chudney calling the group of women her “first best friends.”

Rhonda found out about her biological father when she was almost 13

Although Silberstein raised Rhonda Gordy is her biological father. As a preteen she says she started having questions about her family after she realized she didn’t look much like Silberstein. Up until that point Rhonda had only considered Gordy a “friend of the family” and her mother’s mentor.

“I had started to ask my mother some questions about ‘Why am I not growing?’ because Bob who raised me is 6 foot something and Berry is 5’7” she shared in an interview with Fuse TV. “So I was wondering why I wasn’t getting taller. I just had preteen questions about myself and my relationship to the world and that sort of thing.”

Rhonda revealed that Diana eventually sat her down and told her the truth. Since Gordy had already been a part of her life and someone she considered an uncle it came as a relief to discover who she was.

“I went to Barry and we restarted a different kind of relationship and it was wonderful because all of these things I knew about him sort of in the third person in some ways he was able to talk to me about one to one. We figured it out"" she said. “We love each other and we’ve always loved each other.""

Tracee and her siblings were raised in New York and Connecticut

While Rhonda Tracee and Chudney were born in Los Angeles most of their childhood was spent in New York City. Amid their mother’s split with Silberstein Diana chose to relocate to the East Coast — and after officially filing for divorce her children joined her there.

While Diana shared in Secrets of a Sparrow that it was a tumultuous time for her her children helped her decide to stay in New York. The ""Chain Reaction"" vocalist was excited to see her kids making ""incredible progress"" at their new school.

“I think it was due to the fact that they were feeling more secure and had more of me than they had had in California."" she wrote. ""That was important for them and for me too. In truth we all needed each other.""

Diana also attributed their ""very small"" Manhattan apartment to helping them create a closer ""bond"" with one another. ""They always knew where I was and they always knew that when they came home from school I would be there for them” she added.

After living in New York for a short time Diana concluded it was a “frightening” place to raise a family. She began searching for her dream home in a suburb just outside the city eventually finding a small farm she loved in Greenwich Connecticut. The family once again relocated and the farm would be where she raised the rest of her growing family.

Diana tried to give her children a normal upbringing

Despite her fame Diana wanted her children to have as normal of an upbringing as possible. Instead of hiring nannies to raise her five kids Rhonda says her mother was involved in their lives.

“She’d do a gig in Atlantic City and helicopter back and forth to be there in the mornings to get us off to school” she told the New York Post in 2015. “My grandmother was around till I was 13 so we had that support but my mother didn’t work on Christmas New Year’s or any of our birthdays.”

Tracee has echoed similar sentiments about her childhood explaining that her mother instilled in her siblings that they had to work for the things they wanted.

“My mom always joked: ‘I’m not leaving you guys any of this money. I made this money for me! I’ll make sure there’s a roof over your head. You can have health insurance and food. But other than that ... ’ ” Tracee shared with The Guardian in 2020.

The Candy Cane Land star revealed she worked as a salesperson at Ralph Lauren in high school. ""There was a commitment on her part to a normalcy that I have taken into my adult life” she added.

Rhonda and Evan are also entertainers

Like Tracee both Rhonda and Evan have pursued careers in the entertainment industry. Rhonda started as a teenager in the '80s first appearing in The Last Dragon. She also starred in several other films and TV shows including the soap opera Another World — for which she was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in 1998.

Rhonda then followed in her mother’s footsteps as a talented singer and songwriter using her music to question the “constructions of race gender sexuality and spirituality” per a bio. In 2004 she released a live album with her husband pianist Rodney Kendrick and in 2016 she unveiled her debut studio album In Case You Didn't Know.

Apart from collaborating with Diana on the song “All Is Well” she was tapped as an opening act for her on tour. Speaking with the Sarasota Herald-Tribune Rhonda said she was ""very moved"" by her mom's request because it meant that ""she respects [my skills] and she feels that it's a good companion to what she is doing and I agree.”

Evan has also pursued his own music career releasing several solo singles throughout the years as well as a collaborative 2018 EP with his wife Ashlee Simpson under the duo name Ashlee + Evan. He has also succeeded as an actor with credits in shows and movies including ATL Girlfriends The CW’s 90210 The Hunger Games and The United States vs. Billie Holiday.

Chudney owns a bookstore in California

While her siblings have launched careers in the entertainment industry Chudney has forged her own path. After graduating from Georgetown University in 1997 she became an elementary school teacher as a part of AmeriCorps’ Teach For America program per her LinkedIn. Chudney worked as an educator for three in Washington D.C. and L.A. before retiring to pursue writing.

Around this time she also got the chance to model on runways in L.A. and N.Y.C. and although she didn't have significant success she told Gazette Du Bon Ton ""It gave me the opportunity to find confidence in my beauty to walk a little taller and strut more gracefully.""

After predicting that her life ""would steer back to working with children"" she opened Books and Cookies in 2011 a kids' book store in L.A. to share a love of reading with children and their families.

While the Books and Cookies storefront in Santa Monica California has since closed the business continues to operate online. Chudney also published her own children’s book titled Lone Bean in 2012.

Tracee’s brothers Ross and Evan have partnered up on several occasions to open restaurants in Los Angeles. The duo who are also co-owners of Warwick nightclub most recently helped open The Hideaway in Beverly Hills.

Evan also recently became involved with a second restaurant Leona’s Sushi House when his wife introduced him to restaurateur Frank Leon.

“I don’t know if I would call myself a restaurateur or even if I am inspired to become one. I love being around people in a social environment. Even when I was young I loved getting dressed up and going out especially to dinner” Evan told Food & Beverage Magazine. “I embrace the energy and when I was young I got involved with clubs [Warwick]. I am enjoying being a part of these two restaurants.”

In addition to co-owning restaurants Ross is also an artist and occasionally posts photos of his work on Instagram.

Although their mom Diana is a celebrated singer and Oscar-nominated actress Tracee and her siblings say that they felt that she encouraged them to be individuals. The ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" artist always pushed them to pursue their goals and aspirations outside her spotlight.

“My mom made it very easy for us to express ourselves” Evan shared on the Not So Hollywood podcast in 2023. “There was no bad ideas. She wanted us to be creative and always gave us that confidence.”

Tracee does not have children of her own but she's a proud aunt to her four siblings' kids.

Rhonda who married her husband Kendrick in 1996 is the mom of a son named Raif-Henok Emmanuel. Meanwhile Chudney and her husband Joshua Faulkner have two daughters — Callaway Lane and Everlee Ernestine.

Tracee’s brothers also have children. Ross and his wife Kimberly are parents to Leif and Indigo while Evan and Simpson have a daughter named Jagger Snow and a son named Ziggy Blu. Evan is also stepdad to Simpson’s son Bronx Mowgli Wentz whom she shares with ex-husband Pete Wentz.

“I love being an aunt. I am an aunt to my nieces and nephews"" Tracee said on NPR’s It’s Been A Minute. ""It is a role that I love that I just cherish that allows for deep connection and also a real sort of playfulness.""

The actress spoke to PEOPLE in November 2023 about celebrating the holidays with her nieces and nephews.

“For my family the kids are the priority” she said. “So I mean it might as well be FAO Schwarz for Christmas morning. It's insane.”

""But gift-giving I feel like the adults have just become chopped liver.

From the start they’ve paired a celebration of the Christmas spirit in all its enveloping toastiness with a theme of raw economic desperation. You can trace this right back to the original Christmas movie — “A Christmas Carol” and by that I don’t even mean the assorted film versions (though I grew up with them and especially loved the 1951 version with Alastair Sim) but the Charles Dickens novella published in 1843 which essentially invented the modern Christmas.

It was a tale built around money and the fear of poverty as embodied in Bob Cratchit. A century later “It’s a Wonderful Life” was essentially a remake of “A Christmas Carol” albeit it with a small-town American mensch at the center and Scrooge displaced onto the figure of Mr. Potter. James Stewart’s George Bailey ultimately faces financial ruin and you could say that what saves him from it is the Christmas spirit: the love the community the faith in something higher.

This year I’ve been seeing made-for-streaming Christmas movies rooted in the financial hardship of the new precarious America. And that’s the taking-off point for “Candy Cane Lane” though be warned: The movie interfaces with the real world…until it doesn’t. It’s cozy…and loony tunes.

Popular on Variety

At first it seems to offer a variation on the Christmas-lights competition premise of the 2006 holiday comedy “Deck the Halls.” In the El Segundo enclave of Los Angeles County a prosperous suburban street known during the Yuletide season as Candy Cane Lane is lined with houses whose residents enter a contest to see who has the best decorated home. One of them Chris Carver (Eddie Murphy) is a man who loves Christmas so much that he has named each of his children after the holiday — Joy (Genneya Walton) Nick (Thaddeus J. Mixson) and Holly (Madison Thomas). True to his name he also insists on hand-carving the decorations on his front lawn: the oversize nutcrackers and lovingly painted candy canes. Yet the nitwits across the street who clutter their lawn with Christmas blow-up dolls have won the contest four years in a row.

The stakes are heightened when Chris who works in the sales department of a plastics company learns three days before the holiday that he is being laid off. Murphy plays this cataclysm with an all-too-genuine rue and fear. Yet there is hope. The Candy Cane Lane contest has a sponsor this year (and will be televised on the local news) which means that the winner will receive $100000. Which is just the cushion Chris now needs.

So far so sane. But the movie directed by Reginald Hudlin take a turn for the fantasy/bizarre when Chris out hunting for Christmas bric-a-brac comes across an eccentric pop-up shop called Kringle’s that’s nestled under a concrete tangle of highway. The store looks small on the outside gagantic on the inside. It’s brimming with delectable decorations. And it’s run by Pepper the aforementioned elf who is played by Jillian Bell with a hostile spark that could hardly be less elfin. Chris decides to buy the largest decoration there: a grand carousel tree that features on each of a dozen levels the Twelve Days of Christmas.

Once he sets up the tree on his front lawn something magical happens. The creatures and characters from “The Twelve Days of Christmas” vanish from the tree and start showing up in real life. When Chris’s wife Carol (Tracee Ellis Ross) walks into the backyard and sees seven swans a-swimming in their pool your thought may be less “O come all ye faithful” than “Oh Christ.” Is this what the movie is going to be? In a parking lot Carol gets pelted by six geese a-laying. The four calling birds call Chris on his cell. The 10 lords a-leaping interrupt his daughter’s track meet.

But this in fact turns out to be a mere sideshow to the loopiest aspect of “Candy Cane Lane.” That would be the fact that inside the Kringle’s store Chris meets a collection of six-inch-high gleaming porcelain Yuletide figurines who are very much alive. They’re led by the Dickensian Pip (Nick Offerman) and the Martin Lawrencian Gary (Chris Redd) and they’re a fractious crew literally and figuratively animated who lapse at key moments into compulsive caroling. It turns out that when Chris signed his credit-card slip at Kringle’s to buy the carousel tree he was also signing a fine-print contract. And what that comes down is: If he doesn’t find the five golden rings he’s going to become one of those figurines.

One of the things that’s painful about Eddie Murphy’s bad comedies is that his persona can be so forced. He’s putting on a funny face and you feel the effort. I wouldn’t call “Candy Cane Lane” one of Murphy’s good comedies; it’s too long too jammed together and beneath it all too Christmas cookie cutter. Yet Murphy inhabits the role of a doting dad who lives for Christmas with reassuring ease. And the movie as ramshackle a piece of holiday fruitcake as it is kept making me grin — at the two newscasters (Danielle Pinnock and Timothy Simons) who are like mainstream versions of Christopher Guest characters at David Alan Grier’s prickly Santa Claus and at those antic figurines. “Candy Cane Lane” shows you that the Christmas movie as we’ve known it may be all used up and that it has now entered its anything-goes surrealist phrase. ‘Tis the season to be batty.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vdXMxMDMzLmNvbS9yZW1lbWJlcmluZy1zdG9yZXMtZnJvbS15ZWFycy1nb25lLWJ5LWF0LWtpcmt3b29kLXBsYXphLW1hbGwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Remembering Stores From Years Gone By At Kirkwood Plaza (Mall),"It's officially the Christmas season and I thought it was time for a little nostalgia.

Let's look back at some snapshots from Kirkwood Plaza (Mall) from the ghosts of Christmas past.

Kirkwood Mall is the 2nd biggest mall in the state.

Kirkwood Mall is the 2nd largest Mall in North Dakota with over 850000 square feet of shopping paradise. Originally known as Kirkwood Plaza the mall opened all the way back in 1970. The mall was developed and built by a very familiar name in Bismarck the Wachter family. They later sold the mall for $40 million dollars.

The mall has had several different anchor stores over the years including Montgomery Ward Herberger's Dayton's and Marshall Field's.

Kirkwood Mall has a rich history.

I got a chance to sit down with Kirkwood Mall's General Manager Jennifer Wilson to go over the history of Kirkwood Plaza and eventually the transition to Kirkwood Mall. Do you remember when Virgil Hill fought at Kirkwood? I know growing up in Grand Forks every trip to Bismarck meant a stop at Kirkwood Mall. To be honest it was such a better mall than what we had in Grand Forks. I was always amazed at the traffic compared to my hometown mall.

Jennifer was kind enough to share some old pictures of the mall from the '80s and '90s and I thought I would share them with you. Most of these stores are long gone but a few remain today. As you hit the mall again this holiday shopping season I thought it might bring back some deja vu or fun memories. Nostalgia you got to love it. Enjoy.

As more people than ever are choosing to travel around the world some popular destinations are pushing back on encouraging more tourists.

Whether it's limiting the amount of cruise ships that can visit in a day or banning ships from city centers anti-tourism is one of the top concerns for Royal Caribbean Group CEO Jason Liberty.

While speaking aboard Celebrity Ascent Mr. Liberty was asked what he thought was the biggest threat to the cruise industry.

""There are parts of the world that the volume of passengers going to those locations create a local sentiment of anti tourism movement"" is what he responded with first.

He was also quick to point out that it's not necessarily cruise ships that evoke that reaction. He mentioned Airbnb as an example of something else causing elevated tourist numbers.

European cities such as Amsterdam Barcelona and Venice have recently moved to get rid of cruise ships from their city centers.

Venice banned cruise ships in 2021 and has went as far as to introduce an entrance fee of €3 to €10 to access the city and its islands to reduce the number of visitors.

In Amsterdam they voted to ban cruise ships from coming into the city after instituting a ""discouragement campaign"" that did things such as ban outdoor marijuana smoking in the red-light district and put posters around the city that told young British men to ""stay away.""

Regarding cruise ships Amsterdam officials argued cruise ships in the city ""do not fit in with the task of combating mass tourism and are not in line with the sustainable ambitions of the city.""

A prediction by the World Tourism Organization is by the end of this decade the flow of international tourists will exceed two billion.

To address it Mr. Liberty sees a changing gameplan ""we need to be sensitive to make sure that we continue to diversify our destinations. We need to continue to build incredible concepts like the Perfect Days and beach clubs et cetera across our brands.""

He also said the company needs to keep its ear to the ground ""make sure that we're really good listeners in our community and we build up our communities that support us.""

Reducing their carbon footprint

The other threat that Mr. Liberty sees is an environmental one.

""The second thing which I think is just we all you know we're all trying to figure it out which is how do we decarbonize or how do we get to a net zero emissions basis"" he went on to say in his response to the initial question.

Companies around the world are looking for solutions to getting to carbon neutral and Royal Caribbean Group is no stranger to this task ""we spend hours around the clock trying to figure out how do we solution that. And so we need to make sure that we're set on a path to prepare ourselves to take on alternative fuels as they become available.""

The company already has a plan in place to be carbon neutral by 2050 known as ""Destination Net Zero"".

Announced in 2021 it has two primary goals: get to net zero emissions by 2050 and take delivery of a net zero emissions cruise ship by 2035.

To achieve this there isn't one thing to do but a series of steps. As an example the company has experimented with using biofuels on some of its ships.

Royal Caribbean Group said it plans to continue to use alternative lower carbon fuel as part of its overall plan.

In addition to biofuels Royal Caribbean Group is building ships that can leverage liquefied natural gas or LNG to reduce emissions.

Incredible tailwinds

While those issues that Mr. Liberty brought up are challenges he sees a very positive outlook for cruising.

He sees a lot of demand for a cruise vacation ""the tailwinds for cruise on the demographic standpoint secular trend standpoint population standpoint is really exceptional compared to other forms of travel and other and other forms of where people spend their consumer discretionary dollars.""

""The propensity to cruise is at all time highs"" he explained.

""As the younger generations come in as people started having more and more families and multigenerational families as people have more time whether that's through retirement more discretionary funds and most of all as we kind of came through Covid we all really appreciated what we have.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJveWFsY2FyaWJiZWFuYmxvZy5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8wMy9yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4tbmV3cy1yb3VuZC1kZWNlbWJlci0zLTIwMjPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Royal Caribbean News Round-up December 3 2023,"Happy December!

Please enter a valid email address.

Two generations of boxing are coming face-to-face in Arlington Texas in just about two months and neither Mike Tyson nor Jake Paul Is hiding their age.

Tyson 57 and Paul 27 began their press tour for their much-anticipated fight on Monday at the legendary Apollo Theater in Harlem New York. And despite just being miles from where Tyson grew up the crowd seemed pretty split between the two.

The July 20 bout will mark Tyson’s first fight in over four years when he fought Roy Jones Jr. in an exhibition (Paul was on that undercard against Nate Robinson). It will be a sanctioned professional fight which Tyson hasn’t participated in since June 11 2005 against Kevin McBride.

Formerly known as the ""Baddest Man on the Planet"" Tyson has been posting clips of his training and make no mistake his power is still there.

But he’s no spring chicken.

Of course there are doubts whether at his age he can last the eight rounds each of which will be two minutes.

DEONTAY WILDER SCARED FOR MIKE TYSON'S WELL-BEING IN JAKE PAUL FIGHT: HE'S TOO OLD FOR THIS'

Once a man who exuded more confidence than anyone Tyson obviously knows that Father Time is undefeated and he was brutally honest about how he feels physically.

""My body is s--- right now"" he admitted on Monday. ""I’m really sore.""

That confidence Tyson once had Paul has it all if not more.

The YouTuber-turned-boxer has made the sport the most popular it has been since Tyson’s heyday. He’s done it in a much different way but it’s not hyperbole when one says this may be the biggest fight in modern history.

It’s almost ironic that Paul is going from boxers hardly anyone ever heard of in his last two fights (Andre August and Ryan Bourland each of whom were first-round knockouts) to arguably the best ever.

So when a fan asked Paul if he could ""take a hit"" from Tyson that confidence was on full display.

""They call him Iron Mike Tyson but I’m Titanium Jake Paul.""

Prior he said ""I'm going to show the world that I can outbox Mike Tyson prove everyone wrong and show that I will be the one doing the killing.""

Despite how his body feels though Tyson gave Paul a fair warning.

""Once he’s in that ring"" Tyson said ""he has to fight like his life depends on it because it will be.""

Paul is 9-1 in his career with his lone loss being via decision to Tommy Fury.

Muse,"CAPE ELIZABETH – Chadwick S. Muse 92 of Cape Elizabeth passed away on May 10 2024 with his loving wife of 68 years by his side and holding his hand.

Chad was born in 1931 and raised in Connecticut. It was a hard upbringing with many challenges. As the only boy and a father incapacitated by multiple sclerosis he learned about hard work and responsibility. As a youth he spent two years at the St. Thomas Church in NYC. These years as a choirboy would impact him profoundly instilling a strong moral character that would serve him well in business and at home.

Despite the trials of his upbringing Chad would go on to live an extremely adventurous and rich life. In the 1950’s he served four years in the United States Air Force. During his service he was stationed in Germany where he became a weatherman – a skill he would use for the rest of his life as he looked to the sky.

Upon discharge Chad took advantage of the GI Bill and left for Boston where he would attend university in the day and drive a cab at night. It was in Boston that he and his wife Jackie first settled and where he would begin his 30-year career with IBM. His work with the company led him to many interesting assignments including four years in Paris and four in Hong Kong but ultimately the biggest gift was his move to Maine in 1974 where he would maintain a residence for the rest of his life.

While Maine was home his love for France was deep. Prior to his assignment ending in Paris Chad made the bold decision to buy an 800-year-old home in a charming village called Lorgues in the South of France. Here he and Jackie would spend time each year hosting friends and family and showing them the wonders of Provence. Beyond France and Hong Kong Chad travelled the world visiting every continent but Antarctica.

Chad also loved the ocean and in the late 1960’s true to his adventurous spirit he purchased an old wooden sailboat a yawl called Tradewinds. For a number of years he would take his family on weeks long trips visiting Block Island Nantucket Martha’s Vineyard and cruising Long Island sound.

In the winter months Chad took to the mountains to ski where he would navigate the slopes into his 80’s. Many memories were made in the beautiful mountains of New England and Colorado.

Upon retirement Chad purchased a small home in Morehead City North Carolina where he and Jackie would spend winter months before returning for another glorious summer in Maine. It was only in the last few years that the long drive between the two states became too much and he took up permanent residence in Cape Elizabeth. Looking out over the everchanging beauty of Kettle Cove and Richmond Island he was at peace to live his final years playing weekly bridge golfing marveling at and feeding the birds and hosting family and friends.

Chad was a selfless man devoted to his family and found deep contentment in the happiness of others. He was a loving kind humble man who we will miss dearly. On the evening of his passing two Canada geese flew by his window and the Aurora Borealis made a rare appearance. We were blessed to have him in our lives.

He is survived by his wife Jackie sons Calvin and partner Angela Rodney and wife Saerah and Brier and a large extended family of loving grandchildren.

The family is forever grateful for the support of our wonderful friends neighbors and caregivers.

A celebration of life will be held on Saturday May 18 from 4 to 6 p.m. at the Muse Family residence in Cape Elizabeth.

On November 30 2023 the insider executed a sale of 94980 shares of the enterprise software giant. This transaction has caught the attention of investors and market analysts as insider activity particularly sales can provide valuable insights into a company's financial health and future prospects.

Who is Amy Weaver of Salesforce Inc?

Amy Weaver has been a key figure at Salesforce Inc serving as the company's President and CFO. Her role involves overseeing the global finance organization leading the company's financial operations including accounting tax treasury and investor relations. Weaver's extensive experience in the financial sector and her position within Salesforce give her a unique perspective on the company's performance and strategic direction. Her recent decision to sell shares has thus prompted a closer examination of the potential implications for Salesforce and its stakeholders.

Salesforce Inc's Business Description

Salesforce Inc is a leading provider of customer relationship management (NYSE:CRM) software and enterprise cloud computing solutions. The company's services enable businesses to connect with their customers in new ways through a suite of applications focused on sales customer service marketing automation analytics and application development. Salesforce's innovative platform is designed to help businesses grow and manage their operations more effectively leveraging the power of cloud social mobile artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.

Analysis of Insider Buy/Sell and the Relationship with the Stock Price

Insider transactions particularly sales can be a double-edged sword when it comes to stock price implications. On one hand insiders may sell shares for various personal reasons that do not necessarily reflect their outlook on the company's future such as diversifying their investment portfolio or financing personal expenditures. On the other hand a sale by a high-ranking executive like Amy Weaver can sometimes be interpreted as a lack of confidence in the company's future growth or valuation.

Looking at the broader picture of insider activity at Salesforce Inc there have been no insider buys over the past year while there have been 294 insider sells in the same timeframe. This trend could suggest that insiders on balance see the current stock price as an opportune time to realize gains on their investments.

Story continues

On the day of Weaver's recent sale Salesforce Inc shares were trading at $250 giving the company a substantial market cap of $251.68 billion. The price-earnings ratio of 98.86 is higher than the industry median of 26.85 indicating that Salesforce's shares are trading at a premium compared to its industry peers. However it is lower than the company's historical median price-earnings ratio which could imply that the stock is not as overvalued as it has been in the past.

When considering the GuruFocus Value Salesforce Inc's stock appears to be Fairly Valued with a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.05. This assessment is based on historical trading multiples an adjustment factor for past returns and growth and future business performance estimates from analysts.

The GF Value is a proprietary metric developed by GuruFocus to estimate the intrinsic value of a stock. Salesforce's GF Value of $238.23 when compared to its trading price of $250 suggests that the stock is trading at a level consistent with its estimated fair value.

Insider Sell: Salesforce Inc's President and CFO Amy Weaver Offloads 94980 Shares

The insider trend image above provides a visual representation of the selling pattern among Salesforce insiders. The concentration of sales over purchases could be a signal to investors that those with the most intimate knowledge of the company's workings are choosing to cash in on their holdings rather than invest more at current prices.

Insider Sell: Salesforce Inc's President and CFO Amy Weaver Offloads 94980 Shares

The GF Value image further illustrates the relationship between Salesforce's stock price and its intrinsic value. While the stock is currently deemed Fairly Valued any significant divergence from this ratio in the future could indicate a potential overvaluation or undervaluation providing investors with a potential signal for investment decisions.

Conclusion

Amy Weaver's sale of 94980 shares of Salesforce Inc is a notable event that warrants attention from the investment community. While the insider's actions may not necessarily predict future stock movement they do contribute to the broader narrative of insider sentiment at the company. With Salesforce's stock currently trading around its estimated fair value and the company maintaining a strong market cap investors should continue to monitor insider trends and valuation metrics to inform their investment strategies.

As always it is important for investors to consider the context of insider transactions and to use them as one of many tools in their investment decision-making process. Salesforce Inc's position as a leader in the CRM and enterprise cloud computing space combined with its current valuation presents a complex picture that requires careful analysis beyond insider activity alone.

As part of the announcement the Governments of Chile the Dominican Republic Nigeria and the Philippines expressed interest in participating in the ETA. Amazon Bank of America Boston Consulting Group Mastercard McDonald’s Morgan Stanley PepsiCo Salesforce Schneider Electric Standard Chartered Bank Trane Technologies and Walmart have expressed interest in continuing to engage with the ETA partners as the initiative moves towards its formal launch.

According to the International Energy Agency clean energy investment in developing and emerging economies excluding China must increase seven-fold to $1.9 trillion a year by the early 2030s to keep a 1.5°C limit on warming within reach.

During today’s announcement at the U.S. Center at COP28 the three ETA partners announced several major achievements since their partnership’s creation at COP27 one year ago and their aim to formally establish the ETA as an independent initiative by Earth Day 2024.

The ETA will bring together governments and private sector stakeholders employing high-integrity carbon crediting to deliver faster deeper greenhouse gas reductions and improve the lives of vulnerable people by accelerating the transition from fossil fuels to clean power in developing and emerging economies. Based on preliminary estimates the ETA could mobilize anywhere from $72 billion to $207 billion in transition finance by 2035.

After a year of extensive consultations with government business and civil society stakeholders the partners released the core ETA framework which will serve as a foundation for the creation of the ETA Coalition. The framework describes the Coalition and its objectives and provides an overview of key elements of the ETA: its approach to carbon crediting including the development of an independent sectoral-scale crediting standard for emissions reductions from electricity generation; criteria for participating companies and information on how they would use ETA carbon credits to help meet their voluntary climate commitments; just transition provisions to address worker and community needs; plans to dedicate a portion of the finance generated to address adaptation and resilience in vulnerable countries; and options for innovative financial structures to mobilize investment into energy transition strategies.

The partners were joined by countries and leading companies declaring their interest in engaging with the ETA partners in the continued development of the groundbreaking initiative. The governments of Chile the Dominican Republic and Nigeria announced they would be joining the ETA as pilot countries.

Ten leading companies signed a letter of interest welcoming the ETA as an opportunity to support large-scale power sector transformation while accelerating progress towards their ambitious climate goals: Amazon Bank of America Boston Consulting Group Mastercard McDonald’s Morgan Stanley PepsiCo Salesforce Schneider Electric and Standard Chartered Bank.

“I am absolutely convinced we can meet our climate goals – the question is will we do it in time to avoid the worst consequences of the crisis” said John Kerry U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate. “We all know the challenges we face and that no government can solve this alone. We must all come together with the innovative solutions to catalyze the financing at the scale and speed required to transition off of dirty power and accelerate the clean energy future.”

“We know how to solve the climate crisis. Now we need innovative ways to finance it” said Dr. Andrew Steer President and CEO of the Bezos Earth Fund. “The Energy Transition Accelerator brings a market-based solution to the table in turn unlocking billions of dollars for clean energy. Countries and companies joining us will be guided by high-integrity methodologies and just transition safeguards that center environmental and social impact.”

“If we invest in the climate response correctly it can become a vehicle for human progress. The Energy Transition Accelerator’s framework begins to answer the essential question of how we can help emerging and developing economies achieve their climate goals while simultaneously creating economic opportunities for vulnerable people in developing economies” said Dr. Rajiv J. Shah President The Rockefeller Foundation.

In parallel Winrock International released draft elements of the sectoral-scale carbon crediting standard it is developing for use by the ETA as part of the broader ETA Framework.

In September the ETA announced a strategic collaboration with the World Bank’s Scaling Climate Action by Lowering Emissions (SCALE) partnership the aims of which is to catalyze climate action by mobilizing finance for effective energy transitions enabling developing countries to be directly rewarded for verified emissions reductions from a pool of payments committed by public and private sector contributors.

“At the global level the Bank through initiatives like Scaling Climate Action by Lowering Emissions is partnering with the Energy Transition Accelerator to remove the most critical impediments for carbon market expansion including setting standards and supporting countries access more affordable finance by helping them set up the necessary infrastructure to connect to a global market” said Ajay Banga President World Bank Group who joined the ETA partners on stage from COP28.

The sectoral-scale crediting approach being pioneered by the ETA will incentivize participating countries to intensify their near-term activities contributing to power sector decarbonization including to deploy and utilize clean power and retire fossil fuel assets to enhance storage capacity transmission and distribution and for any needed policy shifts.

The ETA partners received extensive input from a High-Level Consultative Group of more than 30 experts and intergovernmental private sector and civil society leaders from all regions of the world. They have been supported in the design effort by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES) the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ).

“The math is clear: we are falling short of the finance we need to drive a global just transition” said Fred Krupp President Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). “To fill this gap we need innovative financing—including through leveraging carbon markets—that can mobilize the resources that developing countries need to secure a cleaner energy future. The energy transition isn’t just about climate action it must also be focused on improving health expanding affordable energy access and creating economic opportunity along the way. EDF is proud to have developed the Just Transition Framework for the Energy Transition Accelerator guiding it toward a holistic approach with justice and equity at its core.”

“We cannot tackle the climate crisis without urgently phasing out unabated fossil-fired electricity generation and replacing it with zero-carbon energy around the world. And as developing countries continue to face the worst impacts of the climate crisis the rapid transition to clean energy is vital to strengthening their resilience and boosting economic growth” said Nat Keohane President C2ES. “The Energy Transition Accelerator can make a vital contribution to this transition by mobilizing a new source of climate finance serving to bring together companies and others seeking to buy high-quality carbon credits with developing countries that are poised to invest. The ETA’s innovative sectoral-scale crediting approach and its emphasis on ensuring a just transition in participating countries will help developing economies move to clean energy at the scale and speed needed while providing companies with an additional high-integrity means of reducing emissions as part of their corporate climate strategies. C2ES looks forward to continuing to work with the partners and stakeholders involved in the ETA to continue to refine the ETA framework and bring it to fruition.”

The Department of State the Bezos Earth Fund and The Rockefeller Foundation are collaborating for the purpose of developing the Energy Transition Accelerator as an independent initiative.

Sluggish global manufacturing activity is weighing on oil demand and consequently prices. However analysts are looking beyond the near-term weakness and are bullish on several oil stocks based on their long-term growth potential and ability to offer attractive returns via price appreciation and dividends. Using TipRanks’ Stock Comparison Tool we placed Exxon (NYSE:XOM) ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and SLB (NYSE:SLB) against each other to find the oil stock that has the best upside potential as per Wall Street analysts.

Exxon Mobil Stock (NYSE:XOM)

Exxon Mobil generated phenomenal profits last year driven by the spike in oil and gas prices due to the Russia-Ukraine war. However energy prices have cooled down compared to the last year resulting in a decline in the company’s third-quarter results and an earnings miss. Nonetheless it is worth noting the company’s Q3 2023 earnings were higher than the second quarter fueled by strong refining throughput and increased crude prices.

Looking ahead Exxon is optimistic about its recently announced $59.5 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources. The deal will expand the company’s presence in the lucrative Permian Basin.

What is the Prediction for Exxon Stock?

On November 14 Mizuho analyst Nitin Kumar reiterated a Buy rating but lowered his price target for Exxon stock to $133 from $139 to reflect the outlook update. The analyst reduced his downstream (Refining and Chemicals business) estimates for 2024 to 2026.

That said Kumar maintained his long-term forecasts based on the assumption that XOM would increase activity and capital expenditure to achieve the 2mmboe/d (million barrels of oil equivalent per day) volume outlook from the Permian until he has “better visibility into promised synergies” from the Pioneer acquisition.

Including Kumar 14 analysts have a Strong Buy consensus rating on Exxon stock while four have a Hold recommendation. The average price target of $130.56 implies 27% upside potential. XOM shares have declined about 7% year-to-date.

Exxon recently raised its quarterly dividend by 4.4% to $0.95 per share. XOM stock offers a dividend yield of 3.7%.

ConocoPhillips Stock (NYSE:COP)

Last month integrated oil and gas company ConocoPhillips impressed investors with better-than-expected third-quarter earnings even as the bottom line declined compared to the year-ago quarter due to lower prices in contrast to the elevated levels seen last year.

Investors also cheered a 14% hike in COP’s quarterly dividend to $0.58 per share. ConocoPhillips also paid a variable return of cash (VROC) of $0.60 per share on October 16. Including the variable component COP’s dividend yield stands at about 4%.

ConocoPhillips raised its full-year production guidance to about 1.82 mmboe/d from the prior guidance of 1.80 to 1.81 mmboe/d due to the purchase of the remaining 50% interest in Surmont. The company is positive about its growth potential given that several international projects reached the first production stage in October positioning it for strong performance in 2024 and beyond.

Is COP Stock a Good Buy Now?

On November 14 RBC Capital analyst Scott Hanold reiterated a Buy rating on ConocoPhillips stock and increased his price target to $135 from $130. Hanold thinks that the breadth of strong operational performance differentiates ConocoPhillips from its peers into 2024.

Wall Street’s Strong Buy consensus rating on COP stock is based on 17 Buys and three Holds. At $142.05 the average price target implies 23.3% upside potential. Shares are down 2.4% so far in 2023.

Schlumberger Stock (NYSE:SLB)

Oilfield services company SLB previously known as Schlumberger delivered mixed results for the third quarter. The company’s adjusted EPS grew 24% year-over-year to $0.78 and exceeded analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 11% to $8.3 billion but marginally lagged the Street’s estimates.

The company attributed the year-over-year growth in its third-quarter revenue to the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in revenue from international markets. Notably the growth in its international markets’ revenue is outpacing the growth in its North America segment’s revenue.

In the international markets SLB is seeing solid demand for its services in the Middle East and Asia. Also it is benefiting from the resilient performance of its offshore business.

Is SLB Stock a Buy?

On October 24 Barclays analyst David Anderson raised his price target for SLB stock to $77 from $75 and maintained a Buy rating. The analyst stated that the company once again delivered solid quarterly results. He believes that SLB is best positioned as the cycle expands in international markets and offshore. However Anderson thinks that the company still needs to prove to Wall Street that it can deliver sector outperformance.

With 13 Buys and one Hold SLB stock earns a Strong Buy consensus rating. The average price target of $70.92 implies 35.4% upside potential. Shares are down 2% year-to-date. SLB offers a dividend yield of 1.8%.

Conclusion

Wall Street is bullish on all the three oil stocks discussed above. That said they see higher upside potential in SLB than Exxon and ConocoPhillips. Mainly SLB is expected to benefit from the robust demand for its offerings in the international and offshore markets.

Déjà Leonard is a copywriter and freelance journalist based in Calgary.

Consulting firm McKinsey estimates “generative AI’s impact on productivity could add trillions of dollars in value to the global economy” but getting there will require significant training. Which begs the question: Who is responsible for getting employees trained on artificial intelligence – companies or the people that work for them?

Almost half (49 per cent) of Canadians plan to pursue their own AI training while 57 per cent anticipate getting additional training at work according to data from ServiceNow’s recent World of Work study.

Employees are anxiously taking action

Amy Regan Morehouse senior vice-president of global education and RiseUp at ServiceNow a firm that helps companies manage digital workflows says one of the reasons employees may be taking AI training into their own hands is because they are anxious about how it will affect their jobs as many companies haven’t shared in-depth details yet.

“It’s really early days for some organizations in their thinking about how they’re going to use AI” she says.

She says employees are also looking to “future-proof” their skills because they know that understanding how to use AI can help them progress their careers or at a minimum help them stay on top of the technology when their company introduces more AI at work.

Ms. Regan Morehouse says there could be risks associated with having employees lead their own AI learning journey.

She says that depending on the employee and their role they could be learning AI tools or tactics that won’t be relevant in your workplace.

“In that regard it might just be a loss of productive time for that employee” she says.

Along with that there could be issues around privacy security and ethics that employees might not be learning about outside of a company setting.

However Ms. Regan Morehouse says there is a place for both employees and companies in AI training.

“I think it’s on all of us. Employers certainly have their part to play on how they’re going to use AI how they’re going to make sure that they communicate how they’re going to use AI for their teams and identifying the skills they’re going to need and provide that training” she says. “But I think as humans and as AI develops so quickly we also want to be constantly seeking out other information on it.”

Training on AI responsibly

Krish Banerjee managing director and Canada lead in data and AI at consulting company Accenture says companies that are looking to partner with other organizations to provide AI training should look to work with a team that takes the time to understand your business needs and objectives.

Training can look different across companies and even across teams within a business he says.

“It’s equally important that the training is developed and delivered with an ethical framework” says Mr. Banerjee who leads a team of AI practitioners who help companies develop tailored AI training solutions for employees.

For example you want to be conscious of where any company data you’re using is coming from how it will be used and how to do so safely.

Mr. Banerjee says using AI in business comes with risk but training people appropriately can help mitigate it.

He also says companies need to help employees stay on top of advancements in AI and ensure they are using it responsibly.

As for the future of AI training and how it’s prioritized “You will see that businesses and companies will need to invest as much in evolving operations and training people as they are in AI technology” he says.

According to Accenture’s recent Pulse of Change survey 65 per cent of the Canadian C-suite plan to hire more workers and reskill current workers for AI roles.

“We need a skilled work force and that’s not just one organization or one industry – it’s important for the Canadian community and society as a whole” Mr. Banerjee says.

More than half of those surveyed feel that AI is the biggest opportunity for the future of the workforce. Image: Getty

Some 83pc of Irish workers over 40 say they are considering retraining as the artificial intelligence (AI) boom – accelerated by the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT – heightens the threat that workers could be displaced by generative AI.

Almost half of 500 office workers in Ireland polled by ServiceNow a US tech firm that manages digital workflows feel that AI is the biggest opportunity for the future of the workforce with 53pc seeing its potential to boost productivity.

However 45pc said they lacked the technical abilities required to use AI systems or to work alongside them.

More than two-fifths of those surveyed still don’t understand how generative AI tools – such as drafting emails reviewing documents or transcribing meeting notes – can support their role today.

Some 37pc say they don’t know where to start developing their AI skills and more than a third feel intimidated by new technologies and often avoid learning how to work with them.

“Tech innovation is moving at an incredibly fast pace and as the business need increases many of today’s workers are struggling to keep up” says Cathy Mauzaize president of the Europe Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region at ServiceNow.

“We cannot ignore this pace and need to address new solutions for education to help workers embrace the new digital mindset.”",,,,,,,,,

The Lake County commissioners had appointed the Willoughby Hills resident who serves as the director of data architecture with Sherwin Williams in Cleveland and he was sworn in last week the transit agency confirmed.

Officials noted Pizmoht’s dedicated use of Laketran’s Park-n-Ride service for his daily commute throughout his 16-year career and his experience which “uniquely positions him to understand the importance of efficient and sustainable transportation solutions aligning with the goals of the Laketran.”

Pizmoht fills the term — which runs through May 2025 — of his late wife Laura who died in October at age 48 after a battle with cancer.

“I have always had an interest in public transportation and understand how important it is that Lake County residents have access to affordable transportation to get to work or other important places” he said. “It is an honor to serve the community and continue the work my wife started here.”

Laketran President Brian Falkowski added that the agency is fortunate to have someone of Pizmoht’s caliber joining the board.

“His commitment to our organization and his wealth of experience will undoubtedly contribute to the continued success of Laketran” Falkowski added. “We extend our deepest condolences for the loss of Laura and are honored to have Michael continue her work.”

The volunteer nine-member governing board provides fiduciary oversight and establishes policies to ensure services that best fit the needs of the community.

“Lake County is eternally grateful to Laura Pizmoht for her service to Laketran and we are so blessed to have her husband continue her great work” said county Commissioner John Plecnik. “I was honored and humbled to nominate Michael for this very important role in our local community.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvdW50cnlsaXZpbmcuY29tL2hvbWUtZGVzaWduL2hvdXNlLXRvdXJzL2c0NTUzOTI2NS9zdGVmLXR1cm5lci1taWNoaWdhbi1mYXJtaG91c2UtY2hyaXN0bWFzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michigan Farmhouse Christmas - Stef Turner's Farmhouse,"Stefanie and Scott Turner’s Michigan farmhouse might look plucked out of a snow globe now but it hasn’t always been so picturesque. After decades of decline as an on-and-off rental home the century-old structure was in need of a vigorous shake-up. “Nobody had cared to make this their forever home” Stefanie (@stefmturner) says.

Situated on family farmland about 20 minutes east of Lansing the porch-wrapped property which overlooks fields of corn and soybeans is often dusted in snow around the holidays. But inside much of the Craftsman’s character had been blanketed with blah—think dated upgrades and lackluster finishes. Fortunately the Turners were up for putting in the hard work required including a series of four extensive renovations that overlapped with five literal labors of love ranging from 10 years to 10 months. Somehow after the new bones (a more open floor plan!) and new babies (Violet June Rosie Dottie and Ray) were all sorted out Stefanie still had ample energy to layer on warm and welcoming touches befitting of a friendly farmhouse in America’s heartland. (As the saying goes: There’s nice and then there’s Midwestern nice.) “Our home is never quiet but it’s especially lively around Christmastime” says Stefanie. “It’s where all our extended family gathers and there are always people stopping by for a quick visit—then most of the time they end up staying for dinner.” The ever-hospitable Turners even keep a seasonal beer on tap. (Now pouring: .)

To bring that “Midwestern nice” feeling to life in a less sudsy sense Stefanie complemented the home’s warm wood tones with saturated blues and greens “to give the house an earthy country vibe” she says. Patterned wallcoverings add period-appropriate character as do vintage pieces—a reclaimed pantry door an antique gumball dispenser—that offer up one-of-a-kind charm. (Stefanie cites the Antiques Market of Williamston as a favorite resource.) The end result is a perfect combination of a storied old house that functions beautifully for a new story-making young family. “We weren’t planning to make this our forever home but now it feels like us” says Stefanie who enjoys watching storms and sunsets from the new front porch. Besides life’s pretty good inside a snow globe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxpdmluZ2V0Yy5jb20vaWRlYXMvOC1vZi10aGUtYmVzdC1uZXV0cmFsLWtpdGNoZW4tY2FiaW5ldC1jb2xvcnMtcmVhbC1zcGFjZXMtdGhhdC1wcm92ZS10aGVzZS1zaGFkZXMtYXJlLXRpbWVsZXNz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Neutral Kitchen Cabinet Colors - 8 Timeless Shades to Try,"It feels like strong saturated palettes are everywhere at the moment with ever-braver color combinations permeating every space in the house. If you feel more at home decorating with neutrals then current color trends might have you questioning your preference for these stalwart shades.

But whether pale and peaceful or in earthier tones neutral colors have a timeless appeal that makes them an ideal choice for spaces that you spend a lot of time in. They're also a smart pick for areas that can be costly to redecorate such as kitchens and bathrooms.

If you're embarking on a refresh or remodel and deliberating over what kitchen colors to choose then it's certainly worth exploring the breadth and variety of the neutral spectrum. You could opt for something classic such as a white-and-wood scheme; alternatively look to desaturated versions of stronger colors like a creamy beige with mustard undertones or a grey that's tinged with the subtlest hint of green.

Versatile and multi-faceted neutrals can be as transformative as bold color just in a more understated and livable way. Lighter shades work well in bright lofty spaces such as the Plain English kitchen featured above while dark browns charcoal khaki and off-black can help to create atmosphere in smaller cozier homes as well as in kitchens that are lacking in natural light. In search of more inspiration? We've compiled 8 of our favorite neutral kitchens below.

1. DARK KHAKI

(Image credit: deVOL)

Neutral paint colors for kitchens don't have to be pale or washed out: this deVOL kitchen features a deep shade of khaki on the base units which provides a visual bridge between darker elements – such as the worktop – and the off-white used on the walls. This strong neutral complements the warmth of the wooden floors and furniture perfectly.

'Muddy greenish-brown is a color that has come to our attention recently it works really nicely with soft-white walls says Helen Parker creative director at deVOL. 'The overall effect creates a brighter interior than it would if you choose darker colors for the cupboards and walls.’

2. CLEAN WHITE

(Image credit: Nordiska Kök)

When Pella Hedeby redesigned the kitchen of her apartment she chose a serene scheme with subtle texture for a modern yet timeless take on a classic white kitchen. The interior designer and stylist worked with Swedish brand Nordiska Kök on the design.

'Pella's version of Scandinavian minimalism is warm and inviting. It's a style that can also be found in the kitchen we created for her' shares Johan Lundkvist the company's creative director and founder. 'The white minimalist doors create a calm and harmonious feel particularly as the upper cabinets are all the same width. Their sleek design works well with the handmade Zellige tiles from Stiltje and the textural limestone worktop.'

3. EARTHY TAUPE

We love the rich tones of this modern kitchen which was refreshed with a new paint scheme by Avenue Design Studio. The waterfront home had been stripped and renovated for the rental market before the studio was enlisted to inject some soul back into the property for its new owners.

'What was needed was a delicate reintroduction of the character that was lost along the way' explains the studio's principal Holly Marder. 'Now lime-plaster walls and applied exposed brick form a textural foundation while a fresh color scheme has reinvigorated the existing kitchen. We went with Mouse’s Back by Farrow and Ball for this space: our favorite dark neutral.'

4. PALE GREY

If white feels too harsh for your kitchen interior but you love the idea of a bright airy space then a restful shade of light grey could be the solution. In this 1930s San Francisco home Californian interior designer Katie Monkhouse combined powdery grey kitchen cabinets with warm dark wood for contrast.

'We wanted to do a play on the classic white-and-wood kitchen' Katie states. 'The clients had the idea for the walnut island which we elevated to form the centerpiece of the open-plan home. We went with a pale grey on the cabinets to bridge the gap between the white walls and the dark timber.'

5. COMFORTING CREAM

This painstakingly restored 1760s captain's cottage in Cutler Maine is an ode to the dramatic coastline it sits upon. The house has been in interior designer Blair Moore's family for over 30 years and has recently undergone a full-scale renovation project that honors its history while imparting a more contemporary air.

'The original kitchen in this cottage was painted a cheery mustard color that's not dissimilar to Nankeen by Sherwin Williams' Blair recalls. 'When we were pulling the colors for the rest of the cottage we decided on a slightly less saturated version of the shade' she says referencing the custom hue that offers a richer and more original take on a classic cream kitchen.

6. TIMELESS PUTTY

(Image credit: Kennedy Nolan / Laminex)

This collaboration between Kennedy Nolan and Australian laminate brand Laminex is an exemplary demonstration of how to combine neutral shades. 'We wanted to be able to show the product in ways that it’s not typically used. And then we came back to the colors that look great together' says Rachel Nolan principal at Kennedy Nolan.

The firm selected Paper Bark for much of the kitchen a mid-grey in a putty-like shade that pairs well with the warmer paler French Cream. The scheme feels both nostalgic yet different with curved forms that are inherently welcoming. 'We don’t do kitchens that are like each other' says Rachel. 'We’re more interested in how we can get a little bit of magic or some kind of sculptural element out of something that’s a necessity.'

7. SOFT BLACK

'Our client wanted the apartment to have a clean modern design without looking too sleek. It was important for the space to feel comfortable and livable' says Andrea Fisk of Shapeless Studio the firm behind the interior of this New York apartment. 'We wanted the kitchen to be an impactful statement without being too obvious. The dark blue-black kitchen cabinets work really well here.'

'The kitchen is quite far from the windows and we often recommend using dark paint tones in areas of the home that are naturally darker so the shadows in the corners are less obvious' she shares. 'There are no upper cabinets on that wall so the dark cabinets really ground the kitchen and the workspace feels light and uncluttered.'

8. GREENISH GREY

A new addition to a Victorian salt shed houses an impressive double-height kitchen in this coastal home. New internal structures and wall paneling were designed to enhance the effect of the lofty top-lit space while a glazed screen allows light to flow into into the rear of the existing building.

The kitchen features the Osea and Longhouse ranges by Plain English alongside simple paneled doors and iron handles. 'Joinery in French Gray by Farrow & Ball complements the faded tones of the reclaimed timber and fittings used for much of the project' says Katie Fontana creative director at Plain English.",,,

After practice coach Steve Sarkisian called Jonathon Brooks over to his side. The running back had been out of commission since he tore his ACL in the Longhorns' win over TCU. He carried the rock and the offense throughout the year but in the teams' final games of the season Brooks couldn't do anything but watch and support his team on the sideline.

He went on to declare that despite his injury Brooks would be a part of their Big 12 Championship win over the Cowboys.

""I had everybody on the sideline and we took a knee and I put Jonathon out there when we took the knee. And I think everyone's like what is he doing? And when I was done I said when we win Saturday Jonathon's going out there to be part of this victory with us. And he's going to register a snap that he was part of a Big 12 championship game"" Sarkisian said.

More:Our three biggest takeaways from Texas' runaway win in the Big 12 Championship Game

And so that's what happened on Saturday. With third-string quarterback Arch Manning in the game Brooks wearing a heavy brace lined up five yards behind him. The ball was snapped Manning kneeled and proceeded to toss the ball to his running back who stood still soaking it in.

He may not have played for the past few weeks but Sarkisian knows that doesn't matter. Texas' 12-1 record was largely due to their strong running attack that was kickstarted by Brooks and his 1139 yards and 10 touchdowns.

""We would not be here today without Jonathon Brooks and what he did for us in a good portion of this season"" Sarkisian said.

It was bold reckless even of Sarkisian to predict a win on Thursday. Doing so not only showed his determination to win but also his team's dedication to a teammate who had his season taken away from him.

""The guys they love that stuff and so we had to follow through"" Sarkisian said.

""I'm glad he was able to have that moment.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvZG9kaXNjYS5jb20vZW4vc25hcC1mb29kLXN0YW1wcy1mdWxsLWxpc3QtZGVjZW1iZXItcGF5bWVudHMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SNAP Food Stamps: Full list of next December payments,"SNAP Food Stamps checks are a basic payment for millions of United States citizens. This check is designed so that those most in need can have access to fresh food purchases every month. That is why it is so important to know on what day we will get each of these payments.

Unlike Social Security benefits which follow a federal calendar SNAP Food Stamps checks are sent out on different days depending on the state in which we live. If we live in Alabama for example we will not get a check on the same day as if we live in Colorado.

In addition to that you also have to keep in mind that each State handles these payments differently. There are some States that pay SNAP on the same day to all beneficiaries but there are others that send checks on different days depending on the name for example.

So pay attention to the payment schedule because you will be able to find out on which day in December you might get your payment. In fact some of the States have already sent the checks so you may already have it in your pocket.

SNAP FOOD STAMPS PAYMENT SCHEDULE FOR DECEMBER 2023

The last month of 2023 comes with a new payment schedule for SNAP Food Stamps. Remember that each State is totally separate for these checks so check your payment day carefully.

Eli Manning needs no introduction to the world of sports. The legendary QB comes from a family of sportspersons. He and his brother dominated the NFL during their stint in the league back in the day. But his cute-looking daughter’s adorable snap with Serena Williams has made fans wonder how time flies by.

Ava Manning lives for sports like most of the Manning family and is a cheerleader in school. And she is meeting the legends of the sports world already won’t be long till she becomes one herself.

Ava Manning had a cute little run-in with tennis legend Serena Williams amid the Super Bowl fever. Her father the former New York Giants QB Eli Manning shared a photo on Twitter of Eva standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the 23-time Grand Slam champion.

It was all heartwarming.

But the photo reminded the NFL world of how time flies by. Fans remembered that Ava was a little girl when his father won the Super Bowl back in 2012. It has been more than a decade since that event and this fact is hitting the fans hard.

Serena’s husband Alex Ohanian loves to see this sight.

This fan is very happy that Ava got to meet a great role model.

Another fan remembers Ava as the little girl from Super Bowl in 2012.

This fan has a compliment for the legend Eli Manning.

Another fan knows the future of Ava Manning.

This fan knows their tennis pretty well it seems.

Eva is cheerleading in football and is taking the Manning sports tradition to the next level. Maybe soon the fans will see her dominate the rink the same way her father dominated the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl meetups.

The Super Bowl love affair

The Manning brothers had a love affair with the Super Bowl games. Between them Eli and Peyton Manning won four Super Bowl titles in their careers. But it was Eli who fared better in the summit clash with a 2-0 record that too against the best NFL dynasty of the 21st century.

The younger Manning dominated Tom Brady and the Patriots in both the Super Bowl games he appeared in. He and the Giants beat the Patriots 17-14 in Super Bowl XLII in 2008. They met again in Super Bowl XLVI in 2012 and again Manning prevailed over Brady. Eli cemented his legacy as one of the best QBs of his generation. He is living a retired life with family now and watching his kids grow up. They will surely take the Manning family’s sporting legacy ahead.

University of Georgia graduate Amanda Wilbanks is well on her way to building a baking empire. What began as a home-grown operation in her own kitchen Amanda’s Southern Baked Pie Company has expanded into a booming retail business with one cookbook in print and another on the way. We caught up with Amanda to hear all about her inspirations essential pie-baking tips and what’s next for Southern Baked Pie. Get to know our newest FACE of the South!

When did you first discover your love of baking?

I fell in love with baking as a little girl. I grew up cooking in my mother’s and grandmother’s kitchens. The kitchen was always the heart of my mom and grandmother’s homes.

Tell us about Southern Baked Pie Company’s journey from a baking hobby to a booming online business with four retail locations.

I started baking pies out of my home kitchen and selling them at festivals and events in the fall of 2012. I’ve been in business for 11 years now. It’s hard to believe where I started and how Southern Baked has grown. I started with less than 400 dollars to my name and I’ve now opened four retail pie shops in the Atlanta area — in Buckhead Vinings Alpharetta and Gainesville.

I started shipping pies all over the country while managing my retail stores. The pie shipment side of the business skyrocketed during COVID and has continued to grow by leaps and bounds ever since. I ship more pies across the country each day than we sell in all four of our retail stores combined. I dipped my toes into the corporate gifting market a few years ago and now corporate companies ship our pies to clients and employees all over the U.S. for celebrations promotions and gifts.

Growing Southern Baked has come with challenges but I’ve overcome most by setting up good processes to ensure if a mistake happens we don’t let it happen again. I’m a firm believer that you’re never a failure if you learn from your failures make changes and create processes that keep them from happening again.

It’s challenging to scale any business but since our product is perishable and made by hand it’s been extra challenging. Consistency and quality is what makes our product unique. I work hard to ensure as we grow we never waver on our commitment to quality so that every time you get an apple pie or chicken pot pie from Southern Baked Pie it tastes the same as the one you got before.

What is your personal favorite pie on offer at Southern Baked Pie Company?

Chocolate Chess and Chicken Pot Pie

For our hobby bakers can you share your essential rules for pie baking?

Always use cold butter and ice-cold water if you’re making pie dough.

How did you come to collaborate with major brands like Williams-Sonoma?

I had tried to get into Williams-Sonoma for years with no success. Finally a team member mentioned they were flying to Cali and I asked them if they would take pies to the Williams-Sonoma headquarters. They did. They walked right in with a bag of pies and asked for a meeting.

They waited a couple hours and finally someone came out and took the pies and promised the buying team would try them. When I got the call that they hadn’t actually gotten a meeting in their office I was discouraged. A few days later I got an email from Williams-Sonoma saying they admired our persistence and loved the pies! They started carrying them shortly after.

Who or what is inspiring you right now?

Travel always inspires me. I recently went to Miraval in the Berkshires and returned with a renewed sense of purpose and drive.

What is the greatest challenge you’ve faced as a business owner?

All the noise. There are so many distractions today that I didn’t have back in 2012. Life seemed simpler then. There weren’t constant alerts notifications group apps and group texts going off at your fingertips. There was time to clear your mind and focus on the daily monthly and annual goals you wanted to achieve. There was more quiet space. It was easier to stay focused on the main goal of the business back then because there were simply fewer distractions.

What’s the best advice you’ve ever received?

Set the goal but don’t focus on it. Instead focus on the processes you need to put in place to achieve the goal.

And my favorite piece of advice or wise words that have been shared with me over the years is: The fortune is in the follow-up.

What’s next for Southern Baked Pie Company?

Franchising! We look forward to growing the Southern Baked Pie family of pie shops in 2024.

Lightning Round!

Most memorable meal:

My third date with my husband Alex. He invited me over for dinner and cooked the most amazing French chicken tarragon and a chocolate wafer cake with homemade whipped cream. I had never experienced something so heavenly and so thoughtful. It’s not always the food that makes a meal memorable though — it’s the people you share the food with and the connection the food brings. I’ll never forget that meal for the rest of my life.

Nearly 17 inches fell in some parts of the Munich area according to the German Weather Service.

Officials at the Munich Airport stated Saturday that air traffic had been halted until at least Sunday as the heavy snowfall was expected to continue into the night.

Images of a frozen Munich Airport showed airplanes covered in snow and ice on the tarmac.

Munich Airport resumed flight operations Sunday at 6 a.m. local time but noted restrictions were still in place.

""If you are flying today please check the status of your flight with your airline before traveling to the airport"" the airport wrote on X formerly Twitter.

Ground travel was also affected by the snowstorm. Images shot at a train station in Munich show snow-covered trains stuck on the rails.

WHY IS IT QUIETER AFTER A SNOWSTORM?

German train company Deutsche Bahn said in a statement that restrictions have been placed on rail travel in southern Germany for Saturday and Sunday. The company recommended people postpone travel to and from Munich.

The image below shows a Deutsche Bahn train stuck on the snow-covered rails.

Road travelers didn't fare much better as snow blanketed roadways street signs and stoplights.

In the photo below vehicles nearly disappeared under the thick layer of snow.

TRAVELING THIS WINTER? HERE'S WHAT TO KEEP IN YOUR CAR IN CASE YOU GET STUCK

Trucks and tractors were being used to remove snow from the road and make routes somewhat clear for use such as the road in front of St. Ludwig Church in Munich.

While the snowstorm created headaches for some it produced a winter wonderland for others.

Around 760 flights were canceled at Munich Airport on Saturday due to heavy snowfall an airport spokesperson told CNN.

Buses trams and some train services in Munich were also suspended due to the snow according to Munich’s public transport company.

Munich’s central train station was closed for arrivals while long-distance services have been suspended entirely according to Germany’s national railway company Deutsche Bahn.

Deutsche Bahn warned that rail traffic would be “impacted severely” until Monday.

Germany’s regional Süddeutsche Zeitung reported that huge numbers of travellers have been left stranded at Munich’s main station.

“I’ve been sitting here in this place since one o’clock in the morning” one passenger told the publication while another said: “We just want to know if there’s still a chance of getting out of here.”

Police on Saturday asked people in Munich not to use their cars unless absolutely necessary while residents of some parts of southern Bavaria were told not to leave their homes at all a spokesperson for Munich police told CNN.

A football match between Bayern Munich and Union Berlin which was set to take place on Saturday was also postponed with “safety risks and the traffic situation [making] cancellation” unavoidable according to a statement by Bayern Munich.

Bavarian public broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk on Saturday reported that the 44 centimetres of snow in Munich was the most snowfall ever recorded in December in the Bavarian state capital since records began in 1933."

Tomás Del Coro / Wikimedia Commons

Southwest Airlines and its pilots’ union were nearing a new labor deal ahead of the holiday season a person familiar with the negotiations said on Friday.

Shares of the carrier were up 3.4% in afternoon trade.

The agreement could take a couple of weeks to sort out some of the outstanding issues the person said without providing any details on the terms of the deal.

Southwest in an emailed statement to Reuters said “Both negotiating teams are working hard to close out the few remaining items.” The company remains committed to reaching a deal that rewards its pilots and places them competitively in the industry it added.

North American pilots and flight attendants have been pushing for better pay and working conditions during their talks over new job contracts with the company management.

The carrier in October had reached a tentative agreement with the Transport Workers Union Local 556 representing nearly 19000 flight attendants.

Earlier this year major carriers American Airlines Delta and United Airlines successfully reached agreements with their respective pilot unions.

CNBC first reported that Southwest was nearing a new contract with the union.

INDIANAPOLIS — It was a scary morning for passengers onboard a Southwest Airlines flight from Indianapolis to Las Vegas Friday morning.

Brian Koning spoke to 13News after his flight had to turn around and land back in Indy.

""The left engine blew. So there was an explosion and a big flash. My wife and I were sitting right behind the wing. So we saw it and it was pretty scary. Everybody started panicking a little bit. We circled Indianapolis for probably about a half an hour or so"" Koning said. ""Because we had so much fuel we burnt the brakes out on landing.""

Koning was boarding a flight to Las Vegas to celebrate his birthday as well as his son's 21st birthday.

""I didn't know whether to text people and let them know what was going on. You didn't know if it was going to go down or what was going on"" Koning said.

Koning said emergency vehicles met the plane on the tarmac after it landed.

Southwest tells 13News there was a mechanical issue to its number one engine. The aircraft has been taken out of service for inspection.

Southwest released the following statement:",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtcGlsb3RzLXBvdGVudGlhbC1jb250cmFjdC1kZWNlbWJlci0yMDIzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest Airlines Pilots May Finally Be Nearing A New Contract,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vc2ltcGxlZmx5aW5nLmNvbS9zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtcGlsb3RzLXBvdGVudGlhbC1jb250cmFjdC1kZWNlbWJlci0yMDIzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9wcmlvcml0eS1ib2FyZGluZy1zY2FuZGFsLWlzLXNvdXRod2VzdC1haXJsaW5lcy1kZWFsaW5nLXdpdGgtd2hlZWxjaGFpci1taXN1c2Uv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Priority Boarding Scandal: Is Southwest Airlines Dealing with Wheelchair Misuse?,"Southwest Airlines lets passengers pick their own seats once they’re on board the aircraft. The earlier you board the better choice of seats you have.

And Southwest allows passengers with disabilities to preboard before those paying for business select (“A1 – A15” boarding positions) and elite frequent flyers. This is largely on the honor system and as we know most people lack honor.

This passenger complains that Southwest Airlines passengers are using wheelchairs to get priority boarding and don’t even seat in them instead using the wheelchair as a luggage cart to push their carry on bags.

@SouthwestAir you need to control this peaple using wheelchairs to skip to front of line and using it as a baggage truck @MCO to PR pic.twitter.com/Ej33nJyrjr — Milton M. Casiano (@liymil) December 3 2023

It’s a Puerto Rico flight and these are notorious for passengers in wheelchairs that do not need them (and yes I know that not all disabilities are visually obvious but the situation is clear when dozens of passengers walk off the plane but use the wheelchair to board early).

A friend shares a not-uncommon sight from Puerto Rico: 55 ""handicapped"" during pre-boarding including 25 wheel chairs On his return flight 15 used wheelchairs to board only 1 to deboard pic.twitter.com/gHgIsnzsq7 — Bachman (@ElonBachman) February 19 2023

Some unscrupulous people request wheelchair assistance at the airport when they don’t need it using their ‘injury’ for a whole bunch of benefits:

Early boarding gets them access to overhead bin space before other passengers and avoids being forced to gate check bags.



It also gets around basic economy restrictions at United which are enforced by boarding group netting a free carry on bag.



On Southwest they’d have their choice of seats on board.



Plus help skipping security lines.

The phenomenon of “miracle” or “Jetbridge Jesus” flights – where 50 people in wheelchairs board and not a single one of them needs wheelchair assistance when they arrive since a miracle occurred and they can all walk fine on arrival – is most common on Southwest Airlines because it doesn’t just mean assistance through the airport it also means a better seat on board. So when we see a large lineup of wheelchairs it’s more likely to be for a Southwest Airlines flight than for another carrier.

Since many disabilities aren't visible we're unable to question the validity of preboarding requests. We're sorry for any frustration caused today. (2/2) -Anthony — Southwest Airlines (@SouthwestAir) October 15 2023

Southwest could solve this by asking those who are able not to take aisle seats because someone with mobility issues won’t want to have to get up to let people into the window or middle seats and also not to take the first several rows of the aircraft. In other words maybe they can board early but not take the best seats?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL2ZyZXF1ZW50bWlsZXIuY29tL3NvdXRod2VzdC1mbGlnaHQtYXR0ZW5kYW50LXRlYXJqZXJrZXItYWEtbWlzdGFrZXMtd2hlZWxjaGFpcnMtZm9yLWRlbW9saXRpb24tZGVyYnktYW5kLWNsZWFyLXdhbnRzLXRvLW1lbW9yaXplLXlvdXItZmFjZS1zYXR1cmRheS1zZWxlY3Rpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest flight attendant rescues mom AA mistakes wheelchairs for demolition derby and CLEAR wants to memorize ...,"American Airlines plays demolition derby with passengers’ wheelchairs CLEAR is “upgrading” to facial recognition and a Southwest flight attendant rescues mother from screaming baby. All that and more in this week’s Saturday Selection our weekly round-up of interesting tidbits from around the interwebs (links to each article are embedded in the titles).

I have a tremendous amount of admiration (and empathy) for folks who travel with infants and small children. Whether it’s discovering a new place with a toddler or taking a new baby to meet relatives traveling with kids can be magical…and exhausting. I especially feel for folks that have a baby with the dreaded “won’t stop crying syndrome.” While nobody enjoys the sound of babies crying in a closed space (and some completely melt down) the person who I think usually feels it the most is the parent that’s trying everything they can to calm it but to no avail. It’s a helpless position to be in. Right before Thanksgiving there was a woman flying alone with two small children between Las Vegas and Salt Lake City on Southwest Airlines. She was prepared for a short flight but there were two ground delays that kept everyone stuck in the plane on the tarmac…and she had a crying baby. After a couple hours she was at her wits end when one of the flight attendants offered to help and took the baby for a walk up and down the aisle in an attempt to soothe him…and it worked. She was able to rock the baby to sleep. Her response to the mother was “any chance a mama can rest her arms we take it.” I’m regularly struck by examples of everyday compassion in our often depersonalized world. And I love this one.

On one hand there’s a terrific story about how an airline employee beautifully sees a passenger as a human and goes above and beyond to be kind to her. On the other hand there’s American Airlines. I’ve known many folks over the years who had to use heavy-duty wheelchairs. They’re very expensive and usually belong to people who need to spend a fair amount of time in them every day in order to be mobile. Given that it was shocking last week to see a video of AA baggage handlers treating wheelchairs like teenagers would a shopping cart in a deserted parking lot pushing them down the baggage chute in an attempt to get them to hurdle over the barrier. They evidently did this laughing to two different wheelchairs before a passersby recorded them repeating it on a third. The CNN article states that “according to the Paralyzed Veterans of America nonprofit more than 31 wheelchairs were damaged delayed or lost each day by airline workers between 2019 and 2022.” I’ve never been a big fan of AA’s customer service at any level but this kind of disregard is astounding.

CLEAR is a pre-clearance service that uses iris scans and fingerprints to pair you with your ID making it one of several methods for getting a fast pass through the purgatory that is airport security. Several credit cards now provide credits for CLEAR membership allowing folks to join at little to no cost. There are CLEAR skeptics however. Not everyone is convinced that giving a private company biometric data is a good or sane idea. For those folks CLEAR is about to get a little scarier. Back in June the company ran afoul of the TSA following a series of well-publicized security breaches. These ended up being harmless but were serious enough that the government was threatening to impose ID checks on CLEAR customers…which would defeat the entire purpose of the service to begin with. In response CLEAR is now moving to something it calls “Next Gen Identity Plus.” Although it sounds like a bunch of random techy buzz words it’s actually a system that will use facial recognition instead of iris scans or fingerprints allowing customers to “not even have to break stride” when going through security. This will make the process faster and so they tell the TSA more reliable. I imagine it will do nothing to assuage the doubts of people concerned that the company is just another arm of government/corporate surveillance. Those folks will likely still steer CLEAR.

Many points and miles people have a special affinity for keeping the sordid details of their odd transactions out of their financial reporting. That’s partially because some activity can look similar to the shenanigans of more unseemly characters and also because there’s a fine squishy line between “rebates” (that aren’t taxable) and income (that is). So folks got nervous in 2021 when new reporting requirements on third party payment processors were enacted into law. Instead of having to report payments to the IRS for goods and services (via a 1099-K) that totaled $20000 AND 200 transactions annually the new limit would be $600 regardless of the total amount of transactions. This could affect everyone from massive processors like PayPal to small shopping portals like TopCashBack or Swagbucks provided you received more than $600 from them in a calendar year. It seemed unlikely that all of these small and large companies would be able to accurately distinguish between “rebates” and “goods and services” and likely that there would be a some additional reporting headaches (or worse) with all of these new small 1099-Ks. You sold your old phone on eBay for $625? Now you have a new item to add into your tax reporting at the end of the year. This new threshold was supposed to take effect for the 2022 tax year but the IRS announced a last minute stay of execution that delayed implementation until this year. Now in what might be an annual holiday tradition the IRS has once again delayed applying the new rules instead moving into a series of “transitional years” with a $5000 threshold next year then moving to $600 in 2025. Doctor of Credit has the details."

Winning First Contracts Is Even Harder.,"Last year the independent fledgling union Trader Joe’s United accomplished what had never been done before: It formed the chain’s first unionized store in Massachusetts then its second in Minnesota. Once the celebrations were over workers got down to the less glamorous business of negotiating a first contract.

But Trader Joe’s insisted everyone participate in person with no virtual option according to the union. The company’s stance meant grocery store workers from Hadley Massachusetts and Minneapolis Minnesota had to travel to one another’s bargaining sessions if they wanted to take part ― a great expense for a brand-new labor group that was still crowdfunding.

Maeg Yosef a Trader Joe’s worker and union leader in Massachusetts once flew to Minnesota for what she described as two unproductive days of bargaining with the company and its attorneys from Morgan Lewis a firm well known for its legal battles with labor unions.

“I was like ‘I can’t believe I left my kid for this’” said Yosef who has a 12-year-old son.

She said the company dropped its insistence on in-person bargaining several months later.

“They just wanted to stall” Yosef said.

A Trader Joe’s spokesperson didn’t respond to a request for comment.

Over the past two years U.S. workers have notched breakthrough organizing victories at highly recognizable companies including Trader Joe’s Amazon Starbucks Chipotle and the outdoor retailer REI. But in some ways those election victories however improbable they seemed in the face of employer resistance and history were really just the easy part.

Workers are now locked in bitter bargaining fights that can take years to produce first contracts.

The unions at Trader Joe’s Amazon Starbucks and REI have all accused those companies of bargaining in bad faith and have filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board the federal agency that referees labor disputes. None of those companies appear close to agreeing to their first U.S. collective bargaining agreements including Starbucks where the first workers organized nearly two years ago.

Unions have recently delivered big contract gains by striking or threatening to strike at UPS the Hollywood studios and the “Big Three” automakers (Ford General Motors and Jeep parent company Stellantis). But those are legacy unions that have been around for decades squaring off with corporate leaders who generally don’t question the unions’ legitimacy. Even as he criticized the United Auto Workers’ strike Ford Chairman Bill Ford declared himself “pro-union” and called the UAW “vital” to the automaker’s long-term success.

“The union is at its most perilous when it’s first organizing. If you think about what it takes now it just shouldn’t be this hard.” - Sharon Block Harvard Law School

By contrast Starbucks co-founder Howard Schultz has flatly said he could never embrace a union workforce at the coffee chain.

Sharon Block a labor law professor at Harvard University said this year’s successful strikes and organizing campaigns can mask how “broken” the collective bargaining system is particularly for neophyte unions trying to get their first contractual commitments from the employer.

“The union is at its most perilous when it’s first organizing. If you think about what it takes now it just shouldn’t be this hard” Block said. “There’s just nothing in the law that pushes [a company] in getting to a first contract.”

‘Amazon does not want to bargain with us.’

It has been 19 months since the Amazon Labor Union won its historic election on a vote of 2654 to 2131 at a warehouse in New York City and Amazon has yet to bargain at all with the group. The company alleged the union and federal officials acted improperly during the campaign claims that an NLRB official rejected in January. But Amazon has appealed that determination for review in Washington where the case awaits a decision.

Even if the board rules against Amazon the company could extend the legal fight by appealing to federal court – potentially tying the union up in years of litigation before sitting down for a single bargaining session.

“The bottom line is Amazon does not want to bargain with us” Goldstein said. “Amazon thinks they’re more powerful than everybody else and don’t have to obey federal labor law.”

An Amazon spokesperson said in an email that the company still maintains that “both the NLRB and the ALU improperly influenced the outcome” of the election and “we don’t believe it represents what the majority of our team wants.”

Workers at REI’s flagship store in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City formed the retailer’s first union last March voting to join the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union by a count of 88 to 14. They have now been bargaining for more than a year.

“To be perfectly honest it doesn’t feel like we’re close to a contract” said Graham Gale a member of the bargaining committee who has worked for the retailer for four years.

“Amazon thinks they’re more powerful than everybody else and don’t have to obey federal labor law.” - Seth Goldstein attorney for the Amazon Labor Union

Gale said the union seemed to make headway on a contract early on when the law firm Perkins Coie represented REI at the bargaining table and the two sides agreed to several tentative articles. But the union says REI switched to a different firm: Morgan Lewis the same one representing Trader Joe’s. Then progress seemed to stall.

“Since we’ve been negotiating with Morgan Lewis… I don’t think we’ve [tentatively agreed to] a single article. It’s been at a snail’s pace” Gale said. “I think that REI has realized its identity as an anti-union company. So my perception is that they wanted a more aggressive set of tactics than they were getting from Perkins Coie.”

Asked about the switch in lawyers at the table REI said it “retains a variety of firms to advise the co-op on legal matters.”

“We are committed and engaged in good-faith bargaining with stores that have chosen union representation and will continue to participate fully in the negotiating process” the company said.

Employers have strong incentives to slow-walk bargaining once a union gains a toehold since a favorable contract could encourage workers elsewhere to organize. A company might hope to stall the overall union campaign by making the bargaining process look unpleasant or even futile.

“I think that’s absolutely part of their strategy” said Yosef the Trader Joe’s employee. “By dragging their feet bargaining in bad faith and by slowing down the process they make it seem like [workers] aren’t going to have gains by having a union.”

A February study in the Industrial Relations Journal found that only 37% of new bargaining units secure a contract within 12 months of being certified and only 57% within 24 months. The authors cited the “deleterious effect” that companies have on the process by refusing to bargain in good faith or retaliating against union supporters. Employers committed unfair labor practices during the bargaining phase in about one-third of the cases the study examined.

Johnnie Kallas the study’s lead author and a doctoral candidate at Cornell University described the strategy as “litigate litigate litigate delay delay delay.”

“In these [industries] where unions aren’t as strong or have no density at all you can have this deeply entrenched employer opposition to where you almost forget what century you’re in” Kallas said in an interview.

If they can delay progress on a contract for at least a year a company can also hope for a decertification campaign to take root. That’s when a group of workers petitions for a fresh vote to purge the union from the workplace. Last week a group of Trader Joe’s workers went public with a decertification campaign at the company’s Hadley store saying union support was far from unanimous and “our side of the story wasn’t being heard.”

It is illegal for management to assist in such a campaign but not for outside anti-union groups like the National Right to Work Foundation. The Virginia-based group has recently taken credit for helping workers submit decertification petitions at Starbucks as well as at Medieval Times the dinner theater chain that saw two castles unionize last year.

‘Whatever we propose Starbucks will propose the opposite.’

Starbucks workers at more than 350 of the coffee chain’s 9000 corporate-owned U.S. stores have joined the union Workers United since late 2021. In dozens of cases so far labor board judges have ruled that Starbucks illegally fired union activists shuttered stores that were organizing and refused to bargain in good faith. They ordered the company to negotiate with the union in certain cases but Starbucks has appealed those decisions.

One of the biggest obstacles to negotiations has been the company’s insistence that workers bargain exclusively in person as opposed to via Zoom said Dmitri Iglitzin an attorney for the union. He said Starbucks’ position makes it close to impossible for members of the union’s national bargaining committee to participate in far-away talks. The NLRB’s general counsel filed a complaint against Starbucks earlier this year saying it violated workers’ rights by refusing to partake in “hybrid” bargaining. The case has not yet been ruled on.

Starbucks has maintained that a Zoom option would open the talks up to being recorded and disseminated by workers employed at other stores. The company claims it is the union holding things up by insisting on hybrid negotiations. A spokesperson said in an email that the union has “refused to meaningfully engage with the company” on setting bargaining dates.

“We believe that in-person bargaining is not only required by federal law but it will achieve the best outcomes for our partners” the Starbucks spokesperson said adding that “we maintain that our approach to good faith bargaining has been consistent with decades of NLRB precedent.”

Iglitzin said he doesn’t take the company’s arguments at face value.

“They’re just using this as an excuse not to bargain” he said. “Whatever we propose Starbucks will propose the opposite because they don’t want this process to move forward.”

“If we were saying everything should be at the table in person it wouldn’t surprise me if Starbucks said ‘We want our people to participate by Zoom’” he added.

Meanwhile Starbucks has doled out raises to non-union workers while withholding them from those who organized claiming it cannot extend the pay hikes or other new benefits to union stores amid bargaining. The labor board’s general counsel has filed complaints arguing Starbucks is punishing union members in an effort to chill the broader campaign.

“It takes a tremendous personal toll on the workers” Iglitzin said. “But the flipside is they [Starbucks] have destroyed the good will and reputation that most people think Starbucks built up over 50 years of being in business.”

Facing accusations of bad-faith bargaining Starbucks has pointed to its productive negotiations with the Teamsters which unionized a single Starbucks store in western Pennsylvania in June. But the union just filed an unfair labor practice charge against Starbucks according to board records. The claim: refusing to bargain.

The Starbucks spokesperson said the company and the Teamsters continue to schedule bargaining dates despite that charge.

The Teamsters also organized a Chipotle in Michigan last year forming the first union among the burrito chain’s roughly 3000 U.S. stores. Workers on the negotiating committee there say they’ve seen some encouraging signs.

“I think they realized... that there’s always going to be mass support for the union because the conditions are never going to improve by themselves.” - Atulya Dora-Laskey Chipotle employee and Teamster

Employee Harper McNamara described some of the company’s offers as unserious. But he said Chipotle has at least engaged on core issues like workers’ demand that they be guaranteed a minimum number of hours per week. He said both sides have traded proposals on the hours issue that include actual numbers a welcome development.

“That’s not to say they’re where we want them to be” McNamara said. “But when we’re sitting at the table it feels pretty remarkable looking at their proposals because they’re closing in it seems on some of them.”

Employee Atulya Dora-Laskey said the company seems to have “come to terms with the fact that we aren’t going anywhere.” McNamara and Dora-Laskey along with a third worker Sam Smith led the union organizing effort in 2022 and they are all still working at the store and bargaining.

“They were hoping that a turnover situation would erase union support” Dora-Laskey said. “I think they realized or are starting to realize that there’s always going to be mass support for the union because the conditions are never going to improve by themselves.”

The study in the Industrial Relations Journal found that new unions were more likely to succeed if they pressured the employer through public protests and enlisted community groups in their contract fights. Workers at both Starbucks and REI have gone on strike to try to change the companies’ stances. Starbucks employees at more than 200 stores walked out on the chain’s big Red Cup Day promotion in mid-November to call attention to their fight.

He listed off evidence: A Denver holiday parade had banned religious floats; some public schools were no longer permitting the display of Christian Christmas symbols; Macy’s had done away with the greeting “Merry Christmas” in their marketing materials and just down the street from their flagship location then-New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg had unveiled the city’s “holiday tree.”

The argument was laden with evangelical fear mongering that became more and more overt. For instance in his 2005 book “The War on Christmas: How the Liberal Plot to Ban the Sacred Christian Holiday Is Worse Than You Thought” John Gibson put it like this: “The Christians are coming to retake their place in the public square and the most natural battleground in this war is Christmas.”

However the most climactic fight in the War on Christmas wouldn’t take place in the traditional battlegrounds of local politics like municipal parade planning committee meetings or contentious PTA debates. Instead conservatives ultimately took the fight to their nearest Starbucks and in doing so laid the groundwork for the party’s contemporary boycott strategy seen applied most recently to Bud Light.

Since 1997 Starbucks has served coffee in winter-themed disposable cups throughout the holiday season. The first design was composed of jewel-toned swirls dotted with hand-drawn holly sprigs and coffee beans. Two years later the company unveiled cups in an eye-catching Santa suit red and the color became the winter standard moving forward. Throughout the years those red cups were decorated with a number of designs which were seasonal but never overtly religious: snowmen carolers skaters mittens deer doves and snowflakes.

However that didn’t stop conservatives from taking umbrage with the 2015 cup described by the company as featuring a “two-toned ombré design with a bright poppy color on top that morphed into a darker cranberry below.” The minimal design left space for customers to “usher in the holidays with a purity of design that welcomes all of our stories.” This attempt at corporate inclusivity was interpreted by some conservative public figures including internet evangelist by the name of Joshua Feuerstein as an affront to Christianity.

“In a video that quickly goes viral Feuerstein — clad in a Jesus t-shirt and clutching a handgun — rails against the coffee chain for trying ‘to take Christ and Christmas off of their...cups’ and encourages people to ‘prank’ Starbucks by telling baristas their name is ‘Merry Christmas’ so they’ll have to write it on their cup and call it out when the drink is ready” reported Eater’s Whitney Filloon and Brenna Houck.

The way the internet operated in 2015 was vastly different than when Bill O’Reilly had originally declared that Christmas was under attack in 2004; Fuerstein’s message caught fire and it caught fire quickly and with enough intensity that then-presidential hopeful Donald Trump promptly used it as fodder for a campaign speech in Springfield Illinois.

“I have one of the most successful Starbucks in Trump Tower. Maybe we should boycott Starbucks?""

“I have one of the most successful Starbucks in Trump Tower. Maybe we should boycott Starbucks? I don’t know. Seriously I don’t care. That’s the end of that lease but who cares?” Trump told the crowd. “If I become president we’re all going to be saying ‘Merry Christmas’ again that I can tell you. That I can tell you.”

This year’s Bud Light boycott bears some striking similarities to the Starbucks controversy which is perhaps why it feels like the current “culture war” is just the War on Christmas simply repackaged and then waged all year long.

Central to both “wars” is an argument from conservatives that their way of living is under attack and that — despite the fact that many are comfortable advocating for policies that deny the personhood of some truly marginalized populations like immigrants or members of the LGBTQ community — they are at risk of becoming oppressed. Whether this is an argument rooted in genuine fear or is bald-faced political fodder (or both) likely depends on who is giving it at the time which also means that it can be grafted to whatever the hot-button issue of the time is.

In discussing the War on Christmas Bill O’Reilly cast a wide net of social concerns: “Secular progressives realize that America as it is now will never approve of gay marriage partial birth abortion legalized drugs income redistribution through taxation and many other progressive visions because of religious opposition. But if the secularists can destroy religion in the public arena the brave new progressive world is a possibility. That’s what happened in Canada.”

In the case of the Bud Light boycott the issue at play was a bit more specific. After the company partnered with transgender influencer and activist Dylan Mulvaney on a short series of social media posts conservatives accused the company of pandering to liberal customers which is apparently tantamount to delivering a blow in the culture wars. Fox News ran a story that included comments from commentators pushing back against the alleged ""gender propaganda"" including John Cardillo.

""Who the hell at @budlight thought it was a good idea to make a grown man who dresses like little girls their new spokesperson?"" Cardillo asked on X formerly Twitter. ""Brands have to stop listening to their woke creative teams and get in touch with their consumer demographics.""

There’s a certain sense that for conservatives really anything can become evidence of the culture war; it’s interesting to consider for instance how small the scope of Bud Light’s partnership with Mulvaney really was. In addition to posting a sponsored Instagram photo Mulvaney posted on her Instagram story that the company had sent her a single commemorative can with her face on it to celebrate Day 365 of her transition.

As reporter Miles Klee noted in Rolling Stone this was a single can of beer featuring Mulvaney's likeness that ""didn't even appear on the grid."" In fact ""you had to look at her Instagram stories to see it.""

""Apart from stumbling across this online ad your typical Bud drinker would never know of such an endorsement"" Klee added. However as any good Sunday School teacher or politician knows object lessons are an easy way to illustrate a point and thus Bud Light became a symbol of conservative oppression just like Starbucks’ innocuous red coffee cups.

The current “culture war” is just the War on Christmas simply repackaged and then waged all year long.

That said the Bud Light boycott is distinct in a few notable ways. While both controversies benefited from consistent media attention there was more direct political pressure applied to Bud Light as a company like when in mid-May Republican Senators Ted Cruz and Marsha Blackburn opened a Senate investigation into Anheuser-Busch's partnership with Mulvaney. And while the Starbucks controversy had a distinctly seasonal quality the Bud Light boycott stretched out for months and months — even while some of the brand’s most outspoken detractors including singer Kid Rock quietly went back to both drinking and serving the brand.

Part of this can be attributed to the fact that our current social media landscape which thrives in times of potent division continued to help the narrative consistently regenerate. A strengthening “alternative economy” of specifically conservative-facing products like Ultra-Right Beer which was founded with a mission of “fighting the communists” who want to see the Capitol insurrectionists prosecuted was born out of that same political fissure.

This can’t all be attributed to fear of course. So much of these escalating drawn-out boycotts is driven by escalating levels of hate. This is proven out by data that shows that physical attacks on transgender individuals are on the rise.

According to a new report from the Human Rights Campaign 33 transgender and gender-nonconforming people have been killed by violence in the United States since last year's Transgender Day of Remembrance on Nov. 20 2022. Twenty-six of those people were killed in 2023.

""The epidemic of violence against transgender and gender-nonconforming people is a national tragedy and a national embarrassment"" said Kelly Robinson president of the Human Rights Campaign one of the nation’s largest LGBTQ+ civil rights organizations. ""Each of the lives taken is the result of a society that demeans and devalues anyone who dares challenge the gender binary.""

That’s why while seemingly anything — from a coffee cup to a beer can — can become a rallying symbol of the right’s amorphous and largely one-sided culture war it’s still truly marginalized Americans who tend to remain its victims.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vdGhldGFrZW91dC5jb20vdG9wLWZhc3QtZm9vZC1uZXdzLW1jZG9uYWxkcy1jb3NtY3Mtc3Vid2F5LWZvb3Rsb25nLWNvby0xODUxMDY1NzQ30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Week in Fast Food: McDonald's Spin-Off and Starbucks' Slump,"This week the fast food world saw a potential sandwich monopoly a droop in Starbucks’ Red Cup Day giveaway and an odd side project making headway at McDonald’s.

Starbucks as we’ve known for a long time relies on a few key events throughout the year to generate momentary hype and sustained revenues. This year’s release day for the Pumpkin Spice Latte for example saw record foot traffic and the chain’s holiday menu rollout enticed customers with cup designs featuring the all-new addition of magenta (incredible “She’s got a new hat!” energy). But one Starbucks promotion seems to have fallen flat this year: Red Cup Day in which customers receive a free reusable cup with the purchase of a holiday drink saw only a modest boost in foot traffic in 2023 versus the certifiable spikes of previous years.

Division II champ Massillon was the only team to beat St. Edward.

CANTON — Massillon won a state championship but …

The Tigers' conquest of Hoban on Thursday ended their dream season at 16-0 but …

That championship is in Division II the one for schools in the OHSAA's second-largest enrollment division.

Could the Tigers have worn the big-boy pants in Division I? Was Massillon the best team in the state regardless of division?

Head coach Nate Moore hoped to see some ""but"" kicked.

""Nobody will be pulling for St. Ed tomorrow harder than me"" Moore said before the Tigers headed home with their trophy.

On Friday the Eagles got theirs outlasted Springfield 31-21 in the Division I title game.

The outcome gave Massillon reasonable claim to the 2023 title ""best in Ohio regardless.""

That's because the Tigers beat St. Edward 15-13 on Sept. 15 for the Eagles' only loss in a a 15-1 year. Massillon also beat St. Ed's last year.

St. Edward head coach Tom Lombardo had a celebration to conduct and didn't really want to play along. The Massillon game could have gone either way he said.

""Look when you play the schedule we do the odds are you're not going undefeated"" Lombardo said. ""A loss is never good buy you take the positives from it … sometimes you see it better under a microscope.

""We happened to lose.""

The Eagles were 15-0 outside the Massillon game.

St. Ed closed the regular season with wins of 28-21 over Cincinnati Moeller and 14-7 over Hoban and then blew threw the playoffs.

A Springfield win would have allowed the Wildcats to tell Massillon ""BUT you didn't beat us."" Such words went moot when St. Ed survived a legit scare at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium.

Springfield trailed 14-0 out of the gate but was the better team for the rest of the first half in forging a 21-21 tie on three touchdowns by Bay Bay Norman one a 93-yard kickoff return.

St. Edward relied on its incredible offensive line on a rainy night in Canton.

An all-running series starring Brandon White (32 carries 235 yards) led to a 36-yard field goal and 24-21 lead with 6:51 left.

The Eagles got the ball back and rode the line to the winner's circle. Another all-run march ended with White's third touchdown with 1:27 left.

Team of the year? Debatable. Team of the century? St. Edward is that with its seventh Division I championship in 14 years and its third straight via a win over Springfield.

Incidentally …

This isn't the first time St. Edward and Massillon have come up in the same breath. In 1975 St. Ed's gave Gerry Faust's Cincinnati Moeller dynasty a great tussle before losing 14-12 in the Class AAA state finals.

Then-St. Edward head coach Mike Currence jumped to Massillon the next year.

Here’s a look at some of the key things to know about Friday's Division I game:

Players of the Game: St. Edward's offensive line

Commenting on the main factor behind a recent 41-17 playoff loss to St. Edward McKinley head coach Antonio Hall said ""Did you see their line?"" Hall a two-time All-SEC lineman in the 2000s said it is the best high school line he has seen and it was a machine against Springfield. Twin brothers Devontae Armstrong (6-5 305) and Deontae Armstrong (6-7 295) lined up side by side at left tackle and left guard. They are Ohio State commits. Right tackle Ben Roebuck (6-8 320) is headed for Michigan. Junior center Archer Soltis (6-2 305) bulldozed inside run options. Junior right guard Sawyer Prementine (6-3 270) rounded out a group that almost wasn't fair. Springfield had allowed 5.7 points in five playoff wins. St. Edward had 21 points in the first half largely owing to the line.

Play of the Game: Bay Bay Norman's 93-yard kickoff return.

Springfield trailed 21-14 after St. Edward ripped off a too-easy touchdown drive but Norman instantly changed the vibe on the ensuing kickoff. Six-foot-2 Ohio State commit Aaron Scott and the smallish (5-9 170) Norman shared Springfield's running load but Norman made bigger plays and looked more electric especially on the long return. The return didn't win the game but it made it tremendous fun to watch tying it at 21-21. It was followed by an onside kick recovery that nearly led to another TD in the final seconds of the half.

Three stats to an OHSAA football title

7: The number of Division I state titles St. Edward has won in the last 14 seasons. The Eagles won these championships in 2022 (28-14 over Springfield) 2021 (23-13 over Springfield) 2018 (24-10 over Cincinnati Colerain) 2015 (45-25 over Huber Heights Wayne) 2014 (31-21 over Wayne) and 2010 (35-28 over Wayne).

14846 and 5159: The crowd numbers respectively of Thursday night's Massillon-Hoban Division II state final and Friday night's St. Edward-Springfield Division I championship battle. Driving distance was a factor as Springfield is 175 miles from Hall of Fame Stadium; St. Ed is 60 miles away. Massillon (eight miles) and Hoban (22 miles) are much closer. Weather was a factor as Friday's game was played in a steady rain with temperatures in the mid-40s as opposed to Thursday's clear slightly warmer conditions. The biggest factor: Massillon's fan base.

5-5: Springfield's regular-season record which seemed impossible considering how the Wildcats came at two-time defending state champ St. Ed's. The losses were 35-7 to DeMatha (Maryland) 21-20 to Trotwood Madison 27-22 to Huber Heights Wayne 10-7 to Kettering Fairmont and 24-16 to Centerville.

They said it

St. Edward head coach Tom Lombardo on winning a third straight state championship by beating Springfield: “Give them credit. To play a team three times in this game is rare to say the least. It was tough. Most of the playoff games at halftime it's kind of been in hand. Not today.

Springfield head coach Moe Douglass on St. Edward's monster line: ""Our biggest guy is Pierson Baker our nose guard … 235 pounds. Starting now I'm going to recruit our halls and get every big guy I can find who isn't doing something productive to come out for the team.”

St. Edward quarterback Casey Bullock (seven carries 67 yards; 31 passing yards) who missed the game at Massillon: “My knees have been a struggle all year. The training staff has done great job getting me back. I'm really glad I was out there tonight. We knew we could make history.""

Springfield running back/receiver Bay Bay Norman whose three TDs included a 93-yards kick return: “This was our third straight year in the finals. We just kept telling our brothers we've got to get back. We've got to get back to the big game.”

St. Edward's 6-foot-8 right tackle Ben Roebuck on his team's 305-151 advantage in rushing yards and putting the game away on the ground: ""They haven't been able to stop the run all day. Why would they be able to when they're tired?""

This is a liquid-cooled system designed for the densest deployments. Since we have been doing a lot with liquid cooling we figured we would show this off as the team is going through photos from the show.

Supermicro 4U Universal GPU System for Liquid Cooled NVIDIA HGX H100 and HGX H200

At SC23 we took a look at the new Supermicro 4U Universal GPU system. Supermicro has a number of 8U models that are optimized for either air or liquid cooling but this design is specifically designed to take advantage of liquid cooling to dramatically increase density.

The liquid cooling manifold is a horizontal solution as we showed previously on STH. That allows the system’s cooling nozzles to be quickly disconnected from the manifold.

In this system the top tray is the NVIDIA HGX H100 8-GPU with NVSwitch tray. In the future Supermicro says it will support the HGX H200 GPUs.

We could not move the rack but behind the unit there are four power supplies (two installed) and a massive set of full-height and low-profile I/O expansion card slots. We also get the BMC’s out-of-band management port two USB 3 ports and a VGA port.

Pulling the CPU tray out we see a dual Intel Xeon server that is for either Sapphire Rapids (4th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable) or the upcoming 5th Gen Intel Xeon Scalable (Emerald Rapids) CPUs. Each has a full set of 16 DDR5 DIMM slots for 32 total.

The CPUs in the system are liquid-cooled since Intel’s socket is designed for up to 385W TDP and typically higher-end CPUs are used in these GPU servers.

Something our readers will notice is that there are fans in this chassis. The fans allow Supermicro to cool the DIMMs M.2 SSDs 2.5″ SSDs and the rear I/O cards without needing cold plates on all of those devices.

One can see the two cages for 8x 2.5″ NVMe SSDs total on the front of the system here.

Final Words

Overall this new system follows Supermicro’s design philosophy for AI servers except for the fact it is primarily liquid-cooled. A 4U GPU server presents a challenge for cooling as they can use ~10kW of power each. Ten of these in a 45U rack would be 100kW. Using liquid cooling usually removes 10-15% of the power requirement but that is still 80-90kW in the rack before adding switches.

Supermicro has several large-scale GPU customers that can use liquid cooling are building more power and need more density. That is the type of customer this system is built for.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been one of the hottest investing themes on the stock market in 2023 which is not surprising as the rapid adoption of this technology has supercharged the growth of many companies.

Nvidia (NVDA 0.85%) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI 3.91%) are two such companies that have benefited big time from AI proliferation this year and this is reflected in the eye-popping gains both tech stocks have delivered in 2023. Both Nvidia and Super Micro have more than tripled investors' money this year. Nvidia is up 227% as of this writing and Super Micro has delivered gains of 221%.

The good part is that Nvidia and Super Micro are at the beginning of a massive growth curve that could send their shares higher in the long run. So if you have $200000 in investible cash now after paying off your bills clearing your high-interest debt and having saved enough for a rainy day you may consider investing that amount in these two stocks -- either individually or combined -- as they could turn that into a million. Let's see how.

1. Nvidia

Nvidia is one of the pioneers in the field of AI as the company's graphics processing units (GPUs) play a critical role in training large language models (LLMs) which are then used for deploying generative AI models such as ChatGPT among others. The immense computing power of the company's GPUs makes them ideal for training such models and the good part is that Nvidia has raced ahead of its rivals in this niche.

Nvidia's share of the AI chip market reportedly stands at 80% according to third-party estimates. With the AI chip market set to clock a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38% through 2032 when it is expected to generate $384 billion in annual revenue compared to $15 billion in 2022 it is easy to see why Nvidia has been delivering breathtaking growth quarter after quarter.

The company's revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on Oct. 29 2023) was up a whopping 206% year over year to $18 billion. Adjusted earnings increased at a much faster pace of 593% to $4.02 per share. The chipmaker is anticipating $20 billion in revenue in the ongoing quarter which would be a 230% year-over-year increase. This accelerating growth at Nvidia isn't surprising as customers have been lining up to get their hands on the company's H100 data center GPU as well as new offerings such as the GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip.

More importantly Nvidia is focused on maintaining its leading position in the data center GPU market. The company plans to do that by moving toward a more aggressive product roadmap under which it will shorten the launch cycle of new AI chips. This move could help Nvidia sustain its impressive share of the AI chip market in the long run by helping it stay ahead of its rivals who have already been late to the AI game.

Not surprisingly Nvidia is expected to deliver robust top and bottom-line growth over the next few years.

Fiscal year Revenue estimate (in $billion) Year-over-year growth (%) Earnings per share estimate Year-over-year growth (%) 2024 $59 118% $12.30 268% 2025 $89 51% $19.63 60% 2026 $106 19% $23.64 20%

Additionally we saw earlier that the AI chip market could be worth a whopping $384 billion after a decade. If Nvidia manages to sustain its dominant position and controls 80% of this market at that time its annual revenue could hit over $300 billion after a decade. Multiply that with the stock's five-year average sales multiple of 20 points toward a $6 trillion market cap after 10 years which would be more than five times the current level.

So Nvidia has the potential to turn $200000 into a million over the next decade. However Wall Street is anticipating even faster growth from Nvidia with one analyst anticipating that the company could hit the $300 billion annual revenue mark by 2027. All this indicates that investors looking for a growth stock that could help them become millionaires may want to buy Nvidia hand over fist before it flies higher.

2. Super Micro Computer

The AI revolution has also supercharged Super Micro Computer's growth in 2023. The demand for the company's modular server solutions has increased so much this year that it is finding it difficult to fulfill orders. That's not surprising as shipments of AI servers are anticipated to increase 40% this year according to market research firm TrendForce.

The company's revenue was up 36% in fiscal 2023 (which ended on June 30 2023) to $5.2 billion. In fiscal 2024 Super Micro sees its revenue increasing at a faster pace of 48% to $10.5 billion. Even better Super Micro management is confident it could achieve its $20 billion annual revenue target within a couple of years but don't be surprised to see it sustain such a terrific pace of growth for a longer time.

That's because the company is upgrading its capacity to support higher annual revenue in the future by expanding its infrastructure in Malaysia. CEO Charles Liang said on the company's November earnings conference call:

Today with utilization rate at about 60% our U.S. headquarter and Taiwan facility can easily support at least $18 billion in revenue. The new Malaysia facility will serve building blocks with high volume scale and improved cost structure while pushing our total revenue capacity to a much higher scale than $20 billion.

It is worth noting that a 60% utilization rate at the company's current facilities can support $18 billion in annual revenue. So a 100% utilization rate means that Super Micro Computer's existing infrastructure could help generate $30 billion in annual revenue. As a result the company's new facility in Malaysia points toward a stronger top line in the long run once it is online.

The global AI server market is expected to grow fivefold in the next five years to $150 billion in 2027 according to Foxconn which translates into a CAGR of 38%. Super Micro seems on track to substantially multiply its revenue as a result of this tremendous growth opportunity thanks to its focus on capacity improvements and partnerships with the likes of Nvidia which could lead to market share gains according to Barclays analyst George Wang.

Assuming Super Micro Computer does achieve the $30 billion revenue milestone in five years its market cap could hit $75 billion based on the S&P 500 index's sales multiple of 2.5. That would be 5 times the company's current market cap indicating that it is capable of turning $200000 into a million in the future.

As Super Micro is trading at just 2.2 times sales right now now would be a good time for investors to load up on this AI stock considering the healthy gains it could deliver in the long run.",,,,,,,,,

Is Chase the natural successor to take over?

A report Sunday (Dec. 3) by Bloomberg News argues the partnership makes sense as the bank already has a “significant” relationship with Apple.

For example Chase was one of the earliest Apple Pay partners and stores some of the tech giant’s approximately $60 billion cash on hand and is one of the largest credit card partners for transactions at Apple retail outlets both online and in stores.

In addition the report said Chase offers cards that use Mastercard’s network the same system powering the Apple Card.

Finally Bloomberg contends Apple may want to move its Apple Cash debit card over to Chase which already has a network of debit cards that the Apple Cash card could become a part of giving customers benefits such as ATM access.

Last week saw a report by The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) that Apple was ending its partnership with Goldman with plans to pull out of its contract in the next 12 to 15 months marking a speedy turnaround for a program that was initially set to last through 2029.

“While it remains unclear whether Apple has already lined up a new issuer for its credit card Goldman has reportedly discussed the possibility of handing over the program to American Express” PYMNTS wrote. “However Amex has expressed concerns about certain aspects of the program including its loss rates.”

Also in the running that report said is Synchrony Financial a company that is the largest issuer of store credit cards in the U.S. and which has been actively campaigning to secure partnerships with tech companies. Synchrony initially competed against Goldman for the Apple program.

The report also noted that the end of the card partnership represents a setback for Apple’s services business something the company has depended on more and more amid slowing iPhone sales.

Still the Goldman partnership is likely just a small portion of Apple’s overall revenue stream. In the September quarter Apple’s overall sales dipped less than 1% annually while services revenue rose by about 16%.

Meanwhile Goldman is reportedly looking to shed the card business it purchased from GM in 2020 for around $2.5 billion as it shifts away from consumer banking.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZS5jb20vcGVyc29uYWwtZmluYW5jZS9hcnRpY2xlL3doaWNoLWNyZWRpdC1zY29yZS1pcy11c2VkLWZvci1jYXItbG9hbnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Which Credit Score Is Used for Car Loans?,"Our evaluations and opinions are not influenced by our advertising relationships but we may earn a commission from our partners’ links.

A car is a major purchase and most Americans don’t have the cash on hand to buy one outright. That’s why so many people use an auto loan. In fact according to Experian’s State of the Automotive Finance Market report buyers used auto loans for almost 80% of new vehicle purchases and just over 40% of used vehicle purchases in Q1 2023.

When you apply for a car loan the lender will run a credit check to determine whether or not to approve the loan. But which credit score is used for car loans? The answer is complicated and can vary from lender to lender.

What is the difference in credit scores?

There are two main credit-scoring models that lenders use: FICO score and VantageScore. When it comes to car loans it’s up to the lender’s discretion which one they choose—and in some cases the lender might check your credit using both scoring models.

Both models use information from one of the three major credit bureaus (Equifax Experian and Transunion) to come up with their scores which typically range from 300 to 850. However FICO also has some industry-specific scores including one for auto lenders. These lenders may choose to use the FICO auto score when considering a loan application.

What is a FICO auto score?

A FICO auto score is a credit score calculated specifically to determine the likelihood that a borrower will repay a car loan as promised. FICO auto scores can range from 250 to 900.

The score is based on a generic FICO score but there’s a little more emphasis placed on your past history with auto loans. If you’ve paid off previous auto loans with no problems you’ll likely have a higher FICO auto score. But if you have defaulted on an auto loan or been repeatedly late with payments you may find your score is lower than you think.

How to check your FICO auto score

Checking your FICO auto score is a little more complicated than checking your other credit scores. You can access your regular FICO score fairly easily and for free—many banks offer this as a service for customers or you can sign up for a credit monitoring service to access your score information.

To check your FICO auto score however you’ll need a paid subscription to a credit-monitoring service. Some examples include myFICO and Experian. A subscription to FICO will let you check all your FICO scores including for auto loans and mortgages. It might not be worth paying for a subscription if you’re only interested in knowing your FICO auto score especially since there’s no guarantee the lender you choose will use this score. However a subscription also offers perks such as identity theft insurance and identity monitoring which may make it worth the cost to some.

MyFico credit score View Offer MyFico credit score Brand name Myfico Monthly fee $19.95 to $39.95 per month Credit scoring model used FICO Identity insurance Up to $1 million

Experian CreditWorks℠ View Offer Experian CreditWorks℠ Brand name Experian Monthly fee Free Credit scoring model used FICO Identity insurance N/A

Similarly you’ll need a paid subscription to Experian to see your FICO auto score. Other features include subscription cancellation services bill negotiation services identity protection and identity theft insurance. Again it may not be worth paying for a subscription if all you want is to see your FICO auto score but you might find a subscription worth it for the other benefits it offers.

Better credit means lower costs

Credit score range Average APR for a new car loan Average APR for a used car loan 781-850 (super prime) 5.18% 6.79% 661-780 (prime) 6.40% 8.75% 601-660 (nonprime) 8.86% 13.28% 501-600 (subprime) 11.53% 18.55% 300-500 (deep subprime) 14.08% 21.32%

Which credit score is used when buying a car?

Each lender determines which credit score they will use when considering an application for a car loan. That makes it impossible to predict which model will be used when you apply for a car loan. You can always ask the lender which credit score they use as part of the credit check process but they’re not obligated to tell you.

Ways to improve your credit score before buying a car

If you’re planning to buy a car in the near future it’s smart to check your credit score first so you can gauge how easy it will be to get a loan. If it’s lower than you thought it was the following tips can help you build a better score before you apply for a car loan:

Pay down balances

If you have several credit cards with high balances it’s a good idea to start paying them down before applying for a car loan. Using more than 30% of your total available credit can have a negative impact on your credit score.

Consolidate debt

Consolidating debt is a common way to reduce interest payments and pay down debt faster. Rather than paying off balances on several credit cards with varying interest rates you can consolidate your debt to one loan or card possibly with a lower interest rate.

Pay bills on time

The easiest way to boost your credit score is to pay bills on time. If you’re frequently late paying bills you’ll see your credit score drop quickly. An easy way to make sure you’re paying your bills on time is to sign up for automatic bill payments whenever possible. For bills that don’t offer this set reminders to ensure you’re making payments on time.

Avoid applying for other loans or credit cards

When you apply for a loan or line of credit the lender will run a hard credit check which will negatively affect your credit by a few points. Applying for several loans or credit cards close together will have a more noticeable effect on your credit score and it can also make you seem more risky to lenders. In general it’s best to hold off on new loan or credit card applications before applying for a car loan.

Monitor your credit score

Monitoring your credit score can help you identify any issues as soon as they arise. It can also be a motivator if you’re actively working on boosting your credit score since you’ll be able to see the positive changes happening in real time. There are several credit monitoring services available including Experian and myFICO that can help you keep a close eye on your credit.

Additional factors that can help you qualify for a car loan

Your credit score is important if you’re planning to finance a car purchase using an auto loan. But there are other factors that could help you qualify for a car loan including the following:

Increase your down payment : Putting a larger sum down on your car purchase means you’ll need to borrow less. This could make it easier to get loan approval especially if you have a subprime credit score.

: Putting a larger sum down on your car purchase means you’ll need to borrow less. This could make it easier to get loan approval especially if you have a subprime credit score. Prove your reliability : Your credit score shows lenders how responsible you are with your finances but it doesn’t show facts such as the length of time you’ve worked for your employer or lived at your current residence. Bringing documents that prove these facts to a lender can help show them that you have stable employment and housing which can make you seem more reliable.

: Your credit score shows lenders how responsible you are with your finances but it doesn’t show facts such as the length of time you’ve worked for your employer or lived at your current residence. Bringing documents that prove these facts to a lender can help show them that you have stable employment and housing which can make you seem more reliable. Shop around for financing: Before heading to the dealership to buy a car check and see whether you can get a loan from your current financial institution. They might offer a better rate than the dealer’s financing offers. You can bring your loan preapproval letter to the dealership and see if they can beat your bank’s rates.

TIME Stamp: Different lenders use different credit scores for car loans

While it’s possible a lender will use the FICO auto score when checking your credit for a loan there’s no guarantee. Lenders can use whichever score they choose which could be your basic FICO score your FICO auto score or your VantageScore. Knowing your credit scores can help manage your expectations when applying for a car loan—and having a plan to boost your score before buying a car can help you qualify for better rates.

Frequently asked questions (FAQs)

Whose credit score is used when buying a car with a cosigner?

When you apply for a car loan with a cosigner the lender will use both applicants’ credit scores as part of the application process. If your credit score is on the low end having a cosigner with a super prime credit score could qualify you for a lower rate.

Can you cosign a car with a 650 credit score?

The requirements for a cosigner can vary between lenders but in general a cosigner will need a credit score of at least 670 which falls in the very good to excellent range.

Can I buy a new car with a 530 credit score?

Each lender has different requirements when it comes to minimum credit scores for an auto loan. A 530 score is considered subprime and some lenders will not approve a car loan for a borrower with this score. However there are plenty of lenders who will—you’ll just end up with a much higher interest rate than you would if you had a healthier credit score.",,,,,,,,,

Courtesy of Aimee DeBat

The Des Plaines Community Foundation Sysco Chicago and Sunrise Grill all worked together to provide and deliver Thanksgiving Day dinners recently. As a result more than 350 individuals homebound seniors and people with disabilities had a very Happy Thanksgiving.

""This is our 13th year making the meals and delivering the turkey dinners"" explained Rosemary Argus executive director of the DPCF. ""It's a group effort. Turkey dinners were delivered to those in wheelchairs on oxygen and the blind - all those who have difficulty leaving their homes.""

Sunrise Grill 1930 E. Touhy Ave. Des Plaines joined in on the Thanksgiving Day dinners. The owner Chef Jose Medina and his wife Maria and the staff donated their time and skills to help on Thanksgiving. This is the fifth year the restaurant roasted all the turkey breasts and prepared all the fixings for all 350 dinners.

Sysco Chicago provided all the food including 200 pounds of turkey breasts stuffing and sweet potatoes corn cranberry sauce roll with butter an apple and a slice of pumpkin pie for dessert. Volunteers delivered all the meals.

Pete's Coffee also donated 100 pounds of coffee distributing one-pound bags to many families and/or groups with dinner.

Northwest Suburban Day Care provided handmade place mats to each meal and Chippewa Middle School and Maine West High School students created personal handmade cards wishing residents a ""Happy Thanksgiving.""

According to Argus the long list of people who were served dinner through the Thanksgiving Day program consisted of Des Plaines residents who requested assistance by calling the Neighbors Helping Neighbors hotline at (888) 646-8898.

Everyone on both the Neighbors Helping Neighbors list and the city of Des Plaines lists were called to confirm they would be home on Thanksgiving Day and enjoyed having a cooked meal delivered said Angelika Danek LCSW CRADC Community & Police social worker from the police department. ""The city of Des Plaines Engineering Department and the GIS staff created the maps of routes for the volunteer drivers.""

Local volunteers helped pack the meals for the Sysco volunteers who delivered meals between 9 a.m. and noon on Thanksgiving Day.

Tanzania Harper-Frazier sales administrative assistant at Sysco Chicago Inc. coordinated the Sysco volunteer-driver pickup.

""We are thankful for all the Sysco volunteers and drivers which include Bryce Burton Juan Florez Richard Jurczak Steve Luczak Mathew McCammon Tim Muelleman Felipe Ospina Alejandro Resto Luara Sparks and Jill Stadick"" said Harper-Frazier.

DPCF board trustees who came to work were Rich Holke the president Kathy Puetz Bob Argus Jan Goczkowski and Sandra Hansen and helped pack the meals into travel boxes.

""We want seniors to live with dignity and independence for as long as possible"" said Argus."" Our Foundation donates to all the local pantries as well as many of the religious organizations that provide meals during the week for the needy of Des Plaines"" she said.

Some of DPCF's programs include Neighbors Helping Neighbors Program Committee; Healthy Community/Healthy Youth Program Committee; Intergenerational Program Committee; and Seasons of Service Program Committee.

The Foundation has no paid employees and is 100 percent volunteer. Foundation is a 501(c) (3) organization and funds are obtained from individuals businesses and corporate tax-deductible contributions as well as from other foundations.

According to a J.D. Power report Americans experienced 11 dropped calls text or data out of every 100 times they used their phones up from nine in 2021.

This statistic affected major carriers including Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T all of which experienced worse scores in 2023 than two years previously.

Fixing the problem is both simple and complex: carriers just need to build more cell towers but to do that requires investing billions of dollars.

Cellphone users across the U.S. are experiencing frustrating reception levels as more calls dropped in 2023 than in previous years.

Your cellphone relies on several external factors to ensure your call goes through and doesn't drop or the text message you've been drafting can be sent when you've finished it.

Mobile phones depend on your network provider the phone's distance from a cell tower and the weather to function as it should.

A technology expert Peter Tran recently revealed that problems with all three factors are coming together to form the perfect storm that impacts reception.

Speaking about the reason for reduced cellphone reception Tran told CBS News: 'It is absolutely possible for a number of reasons' adding that while it is a lesser issue smoke from wildfires can absorb or reflect cell signals but more likely is the issue of the number of cell towers not meeting the demand.

Tran said cell traffic throughout the country is increasing but the number of cell towers isn't.

Trans compared the issue with traffic saying: 'Just like you have car traffic congestion that is going into one lane it is similar to that where you have over 300 million cell phones in this country coming into just a limited amount of access to the towers.'

Verizon is working to build more cell towers to meet the growing demand.

Carriers are working to build more cell towers and are also buying larger spectrums of frequencies which gives providers the ability to deliver coverage in multiple areas Time Magazine reports.

The problem is that issues are rising in areas with growing populations meaning the existing number of cell towers is no longer sufficient for that area.

Verizon did not immediately respond to Dailymail.com's request for comment.

But a spokesperson from the company told CBS News in August that they had finished major upgrades that would make a significant difference for cell phone users.

'Now we are able to take that two-lane highway and make it a 20-lane' the spokesperson said.

A report revealed which carrier offers the best network availability

'Customers are going to see massive amounts of faster data speeds to their mobile phones.'

In some places carriers are getting pushback from residents who don't want new cell towers taking up space in their town.

Residents of Beacon New York have an ongoing petition on Change.org demanding Verizon stop the construction of a 125-foot-tall cell tower in a local cemetery.

The petition argues that building the tower will displace animals like deer bears and foxes and put their homes and children at risk.

They also argue that a cell tower in their backyards will put off people's ability to sell their homes.

'This cell tower is being proposed as a short-term solution with long-term ramifications and decreased property values falling on us the taxpayers and homeowners' the petition says.

Aside from waiting for or fighting against new cell towers to go up in your area cellphone users can take several steps to ensure they are getting the best possible service.

Keeping your phone's software up-to-date is imperative because it fixes any known issues or bugs in its operating system.

It also improves your phone's overall performance and functionality while ignoring the updates can make your phone slow down.

Users can also check their cell plan some of which have soft data caps – even unlimited plans – which will drastically slow your service down without your knowledge.

T-Mobile on August quietly rolled out a new hotspot plan that gives customers access to high-speed data for only $15 a month or $10 with the autopay discount. According to internal documents reviewed by The Mobile Report the plan includes 30 GB of data which is reduced to 600 Kbps after the limit is reached. Customers can stream videos at up to 4K UHD.

This plan gives consumers who only want to connect one device a budget-friendly option for high-speed internet without signing up for a voice plan or other internet packages.

T-Mobile’s cheapest hotspot plan is less expensive than other carriers. While Verizon also has a plan for $10 it only offers 15 GB of data and also requires customers to have a voice line. Without a voice line a Verizon hotspot costs $90 for 100 GB. AT&T has a 15 GB plan for $25 or 50 GB for $50 a month and also requires a voice line.

The plan is available to new and existing U.S. and Puerto Rico customers on the Basic Mobile Internet Plan.

A voice line isn’t required but customers must supply or buy their own hotspot device. T-Mobile does not include any device discounts for this plan. The 30 GB plan works with connected laptops or Chromebooks with an on-device connection with the option to share data with other devices through a mobile hotspot. For tablets T-Mobile recommends using the Magenta Business Tablet or Magenta Business Tablet Plus plans with an additional hotspot.

T-Mobile’s 30 GB hotspot plan doesn’t come with a Price Lock Guarantee so that low rate could go up over time. Customers who want to sign up should verify any active promotional deals they have won’t expire by adding this new data plan.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vY29yZGN1dHRlcnNuZXdzLmNvbS9ob3ctdG8tZ2V0LWZyZWUtcGFyYW1vdW50LW5ldGZsaXgtYXBwbGUtdHYtcGVhY29jay1tb3JlLWZyb20tc2VydmljZXMteW91LWFscmVhZHktcGF5LWZvci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Get FREE Paramount+ Netflix Apple TV+ Peacock & More from Services You Already Pay For | Cord Cutters ...,"Do you already pay for a cell phone plan?

At $118 each month Denver’s monthly phone bill is $1 less than the national average according to DoxoInsights the research arm of online-bill payment service Doxo. The company calculated the 10 most common household bills to determine the amount by region (as well as for 48 towns and cities in Colorado). Add all those monthly bills up though and metro Denver was much more expensive with average household spending on bills at 23.8% higher than the U.S. Blame our housing costs auto payments and insurance for helping push Denver’s inflation rate higher than the nation’s all year.

But don’t blame your wireless phone company.

“Verizon does not charge differently based on location” said Liz Gelardi Verizon’s local spokesperson “but local and state taxes do vary.” The company also has plans where taxes and fees are rolled into one cost.

Similar comments were shared by AT&T and T-Mobile.

Monthly wireless revenue has been shrinking for years according to CTIA the wireless industry trade group. In a survey of carriers CTIA data found that the per unit revenue averaged $34.56 per month down 26% from $47 a decade ago.

“Market competition has brought the price per line down 26% in 10 years. That’s wonderful” said Adam Hoffer director of excise tax policy for the Tax Foundation a nonpartisan think tank that analyzes tax policies. “But at the same time we’ve seen a 7 percentage point increase in taxes. So bills have come down but taxes have eaten away a large percentage of that gain.”

Nearly 25% of the monthly bill is taxes fees

Hoffer co-authored the 2023 “Excise Taxes and Fees on Wireless Service” report and found that wireless taxes and fees have been steadily rising over the years and now make up 24.5% of the average bill. It was 17.1% in 2014.

That’s due to a mix of things. Federal taxes and fees jumped 36% in 2019 largely due to consumers ditching their landline phone service. Fewer customers has meant fewer contributors to the Federal Universal Service Fund which has long taxed voice calls (and not wireless internet data) to subsidize service in rural areas and for low-income households. The federal rate has gone up another 20% since then and currently is 10.83% of the monthly bill. That’s down for the first time in six years and Hoffer said it may be due to more lines or lower expenses for the fund. But that’s a fee all American wireless customers pay.

It’s the local fees that make monthly bills vary by location. Overall the average state fee increased to a rate of 13.7% this year according to the report. And if you are paying for multiple phone lines those fees add up.

The impact of local and state fees

Some is due to an increase in each state’s contribution to its Universal Service Fund. This year Texans experienced the largest annual rate increase to 17.42% from 11.89%. The highest overall local rates were in Illinois at 22.96%. The lowest was Idaho at 2.89%.

Colorado’s rate was near the middle at 13.42%. Hoffer wasn’t aware of any additional local taxes in the state. But local governments in 14 states do add more fees including Chicago which charges $5 extra per line to pay for modernizing its 911 system. Baltimore is at $4 a line.

Additional state costs include fees to support 911 and 988 a newer number dedicated to suicide prevention nationwide. Fees don’t change frequently but proposals do pop up annually Hoffer said. In January Colorado raised its monthly 988 fee to 27 cents from 18 cents per line.

“The biggest flag on applying wireless taxes is that it’s a very straightforward regressive tax” Hoffer said. “Higher-income households don’t spend a larger percentage of their budget on wireless bills than lower-income households. … Roughly 70% of low-income households live in wireless-only households so these taxes can hit them relatively harder than other groups.”

Taxes don’t usually go away. But Hoffer said he’s advising a group in New Hampshire looking into getting rid of the state’s tax on phone calls. Getting rid of the tax doesn’t mean the state is getting rid of the services the fees help fund such as the emergency 911 calls.

“The go-to answer is just broad sales taxes (because) these better capture every single person in the state that is paying the tax rather than only those who have a cellphone. Of course New Hampshire has the challenge of (no) sales tax. Then you have to look elsewhere maybe property taxes or income taxes” he said. “I think most people just pay the tax and aren’t scrutinizing their wireless bills every month to see how much they pay in taxes. They just hand over the money and to some extent that’s what the policymakers like.”

My multi-state family plan

For fun I looked at my own monthly wireless bill pretty closely. I happen to have a large family plan to support retired relatives. Phone lines are spread out in California Texas and Colorado.

The highest? Texas.

Looking for a new plan?

I asked AT&T T-Mobile and Verizon to share their most affordable plans. Here’s how they interpreted that request:

AT&T Unlimited Starter $35/month — That’s the per-line cost when you get four lines. It includes unlimited data though speeds may slow if the network is busy. It also offers 3 GB for a personal hotspot standard-definition video streaming and a free app to block spam calls. >> Tips on choosing a plan

Add-ons like a mobile hotspot international access and video-streaming subscriptions can be added for $10 more per month. >> Unlimited plans

➔ Local contender: Boost Mobile. Officials with Boost didn’t respond to similar questions. The wireless brand is owned by Dish Network in Douglas County. But Dish better known for its satellite TV service did share earlier this week that the Boost wireless network is using 5G technology for voice calls in the Denver area. According to its site mobile plans start at $25 a month per line.

But for Park Hanul the picture is not quite as rosy. The 32-year-old Seoul-based employee at a firm that provides aid programmes bought about 110000 yen (US$743) over the past month as a side investment. So far at least it has not worked out as she expected.

South Koreans are celebrating after the yen fell to its lowest level against the won in 15 years. They are travelling to Japan in their hordes and almost doubling their purchases of Japanese goods.

Park is among a legion of South Korea ’s retail investors who are betting the Japanese currency’s slump must end. Yen deposits at South Korean banks jumped to a record in October according to the latest Bank of Korea data.

The yen dropped to its lowest against the won since 2008 on November 16. While it has gained nearly 3 per cent from that low it is still down 9 per cent this year.

Park says she is willing to put a further 3 million won (US$2303) into the yen if the Japanese currency keeps weakening.

The optimism reflects expectations that Japan’s central bank will soon start raising interest rates. As much of the rest of the world tightened policy in a bid to tame inflation Japan went the other way keeping its policy rate below zero to spur further price rises in an economy that had been beset by deflation.

Investors have kept their focus on the yawning interest rate gap between Japan and its peers which makes currencies in countries with higher yields look a better bet. Leveraged funds increased their net short positions on the Japanese currency to the most since April 2022 in the week ended November 14. before paring it slightly in the following week.

T. Rowe Price. is betting the yen will remain weak due to its wide rate gap with the US. The “yen may strengthen from 30-year lows versus the US dollar but we do not foresee that interest-rate differential narrowing significantly the weak yen should continue” Daniel Hurley a portfolio specialist for emerging market and Japanese equities wrote in a note last week.

Despite this cautiousness South Korean retail investors still see opportunities in Japan. Improving relations between the two nations may partly explain the interest.

Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has sought to boost ties with Japan after disputes surrounding Japan’s colonial rule of the Korean peninsula flared under his predecessor. Leaders of the two countries held the first formal summit since 2011 on Japanese soil in March this year. In June Japan reinstated South Korea as one of its preferred trading partners and agreed to restore a foreign currency swap arrangement worth as much as US$10 billion.

South Koreans bought the most Japanese equities this year since data became available in 2011. That can be another way to bet on the yen as unhedged stock purchases benefit if the currency rises.

And inflows into a BlackRock Inc. exchange-traded fund that tracks long-dated Treasuries – but is priced in yen – quadrupled in the second quarter from the previous one.

South Korean tourists to Japan from January to September jumped almost five-fold from the same period last year close to pre-Covid levels while travels to other countries were seen still recovering according to data from the Korea Tourism Organization. Direct purchases of Japanese goods have nearly doubled through the past three years of the yen’s relentless fall while that of the US eased over the same period according to the nation’s statistics office.

Lee Joon-gyu 26 who works in interior design in Seoul says travelling to Japan is now cheaper than going somewhere in Korea. He booked a trip to Nagoya on a whim just two weeks in advance and plans to stock up on clothes and liquor while there. His 1 million won gave him 115000 yen based on last week’s exchange rate. Just two years ago the same amount of won would have handed him 96000 yen.

For the yen investors there is also hope things might change. Some investors expect the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates next year which should help the Japanese currency. Growing inflation pressures in Japan are adding pressure on the Bank of Japan to end its ultra-loose monetary policy which it kept unchanged last month. Its next policy decision is on December 19.

Pacific Investment Management Co. which manages nearly US$2 trillion of assets is buying the yen on a bet the BOJ will have to raise rates.

“Inquiries on the yen at our sales desks have increased quite a lot” said Moon Junghiu an economist at KB Kookmin Bank a South Korean lender.

And despite her yen investment not working out so far Park the retail investor is not concerned.

If the Japanese currency does not rise “I’ll just use it for my next trip to Japan” she said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmtldGJlYXQuY29tL2luc3RhbnQtYWxlcnRzL255c2UtYmFiYS1zZWMtZmlsaW5nLTIwMjMtMTItMDMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) Shares Sold by Parsifal Capital Management LP,"Parsifal Capital Management LP cut its holdings in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA - Free Report) by 7.5% in the second quarter according to its most recent Form 13F filing with the Securities & Exchange Commission.

It's official: New AAA games now officially cost $69.99 across the board (well except for games like Alan Wake II). The new pricing trend was first introduced by Sony Take-Two Interactive and Electronic Arts at the early onset of the new PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X generation and one by one major publishers and game-makers started moving towards the upped MSRP--even Nintendo who charged $69.99 for Tears of the Kingdom.

Japanese publishers like SEGA and Capcom used to be among the last big-name publishers to keep their titles the pre-Gen 9 prices but even they have increased costs. SEGA is charging $69.99 for the new Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth game and Capcom well they're starting off their next fiscal year with their first $69.99 game.

Days ago Capcom announced that Dragon's Dogma II would launch on March 22 2024 on all platforms. Navigating over to the pre-order pages for the game shows a $69.99 price tag on the PlayStation Store Xbox and on Steam indicating that Capcom should be using this mainline price moving forward.

This means my earlier predictions were wrong.

Recently Capcom management told investors that the company aspired to eventually sell 100 million games per year. Capcom is almost halfway there having shipped over 41 million games in FY 2022.

Since Capcom is so far off the mark I predicted that the publisher could keep its games at $59.99 in an effort to sell more copies. This of course would deliver less revenue per copy sold but it could improve the odds of hitting 100 million sooner than later.

It turns out that's not the case. Capcom is indeed raising the prices of its games to $69.99 but we should still see the other part of it's game plan stay where it is; Capcom relies heavily on frequent discounts and sales (such as the incredible Black Friday deals that we just saw) in order to move higher volume.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9nYW1pbmcvZ3RhLTYtZnJvbS1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGUtdG8tZ2FtZXBsYXktaGVyZXMtZXZlcnl0aGluZy13ZS1rbm93LXNvLWZhci05MDUyNjQ4L9IBhQFodHRwczovL2luZGlhbmV4cHJlc3MuY29tL2FydGljbGUvdGVjaG5vbG9neS9nYW1pbmcvZ3RhLTYtZnJvbS1yZWxlYXNlLWRhdGUtdG8tZ2FtZXBsYXktaGVyZXMtZXZlcnl0aGluZy13ZS1rbm93LXNvLWZhci05MDUyNjQ4L2xpdGUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,GTA 6: From release date to gameplay here’s everything we know so far,"Rockstar Games recently announced that the first official trailer for GTA 6 will be released on December 5 and shared an image hinting that the upcoming title might be set in the iconic Vice City a fictionalised version of Miami.

In a minimalist post on social media the company said that “Trailer 1” would be released on December 5 at 1400 GMT in an image showing a sunset sky and palm trees.

Even though the post did not mention GTA specifically this seemed to substantiate media reports that the sixth installment would be set in the a fictionalized version of Miami.

Rockstar Games is known for keeping a tight veil of secrecy around its releases never giving a date in advance contrary to general industry protocol.

Last year the studio was the victim of a hack with over 90 images and videos appearing on social media in what is considered to be one of the biggest leaks in video game history.

It remains unclear whether GTA VI will be released next year or in 2025 as Rockstar has a history of announcing games more than a year prior to their release.

GTA V has sold around 190 million copies according to Rockstar parent Take-Two Interactive making it the best-selling game in the United States for the past decade based on both unit and dollar sales.

One of the most famous franchises in the world of video games GTA has never been free of controversy due to its sulfurous mix of violence sex and gangster life.

Previous episodes have seen players take on roles in the Italian mafia follow in the footsteps of “Scarface” kingpin Tony Montana or slip into the shoes of a former gang member in Los Angeles.

The series has been heavily criticized for its particularly misogynistic depictions of women caricatures of minorities and its use of torture. — Agence France-Presse"

Tracy Phillips of Huntington West Virginia originally filed the wrongful death suit against the Target Corporation in Hamilton County Common Pleas Court in October. It was removed to federal court in Cincinnati on Wednesday.

In court documents Phillips said Target security failed to intervene in March 2022 when his son 24-year-old Alias Phillips was threatened with a gun inside the store before he was chased and gunned down in the parking lot.

""Target was partially at fault for the death of Alias Phillips for the lack of store security and monitoring which could have prevented the outcome if security would have intervened"" the lawsuit reads.

Tracy Phillips is seeking $50 million in compensatory damages as well as an apology from Target.

Target has asked the court to dismiss the suit because Tracy Phillips made no claims that he is the administrator or executor of his son's estate and therefore lacks standing to sue for wrongful death.

Anthony McIntosh 23 was convicted in connection with Alias Phillips' death and sentenced in August to a prison term of 21 to 26½ years – a punishment that McIntosh’s attorneys and prosecutors had agreed upon as part of his plea to involuntary manslaughter charges. He was also convicted in the death of 42-year-old Diantues Kemper who was killed outside a gas station in October 2021.

After Alias Phillips walked out of the Target with his sister and at least one other person McIntosh chased them down firing multiple times. Prosecutors have said Alias Phillips returned fire with a handgun he legally possessed.

COP28 President Sultan al-Jaber said the pledges were part of his efforts to proactively engage with oil and gas companies during the talks. Jaber has faced a number of negative headlines over his concurrent role as the CEO of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.

""If we want to accelerate progress across the climate agenda we must bring everyone in to be accountable and responsible for climate action"" said Jaber. ""We must all focus on reducing emissions and apply a positive can-do vision to drive climate action and get everyone to take action. We need a clear action plan and I am determined to deliver one.""

The agreement is part of a Global Decarbonization Accelerator launched at COP28 focused on three pillars: energy systems of the future such as renewables and hydrogen; the fossil fuel sector and emission-intensive industries; and methane.

Under the oil and gas pillar the industrial transition accelerator will focus on decarbonization across key heavy-emitting sectors: cement aluminum steel oil and gas power and aviation/maritime.

The 50 oil and gas companies account for 40% of global oil production. The net zero commitment relates to scope 1 and 2 emissions a COP28 presidency spokesman said.

Key national oil companies such as Kuwait Petroleum Corporation QatarEnergy Iraq's State Oil Marketing Company China's Sinopec CNOOC and PetroChina and the National Iranian Oil Company were missing from this list.

This comes as many investors and activists don't believe the industry has done enough and they have doubled down on efforts to put these companies under pressure. Many fossil fuel producers will be forced to balance the need to maximize shareholders' financial returns with pressures to decarbonize.

Methane challenge

On methane the agreement sees the 50 companies commit to setting interim targets that would reduce methane emissions to 0.2% of oil and natural gas production by 2030 and to end routine flaring.

What makes this pledge distinctive is that it will be scrutinized using technology and data.

The United Nations Environment Program's International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO) the Environmental Defense Fund and the International Energy Agency will help monitor compliance by tracking methane emissions using satellite data and other analytical tools.

Fred Krupp president of the non-profit advocacy group the Environmental Defense Fund said the pledge had the potential to be the most impactful climate action in over three decades.

""It could lower the planet's temperature and reduce cataclysmic storms from what we will otherwise experience in the next decade"" he said.

Methane accounts for 45% to 50% of oil and gas emissions 80% of it from upstream the spokesperson said. The methane pledge includes zero routine flaring by 2030 he added.

The US and China will separately continue their conversation on methane reduction a spokesman for the COP28 presidency said.

The energy sector -- including oil natural gas coal and bioenergy -- accounts for nearly 40% of methane emissions from human activity.

MPC demand low

Methane emissions generated by production are a significant contributor to the carbon intensity of natural gas.

Platts part of S&P Global Commodity Insights assesses methane performance certificates traded in the spot market that represent low methane emissions in natural gas production in the US and Canada.

Each MPC represents 1 MMBtu of gas with zero methane emissions produced. Platts reflects MPCs that have been issued against production that has a methane intensity of less than 0.10%.

Prices have fallen to just $0.01/MPC in recent months with very little demand for the certificates at present.

Many countries and governments are gradually starting to enforce measures to curtail methane leaks and emissions.

In November the EU reached a landmark political agreement on a regulation for tracking and reducing methane emissions in the energy sector -- the first-ever EU law to curb methane emissions.

Similarly in early-November China issued an action plan to control methane emissions that establishes a broad framework for measurement and identifies selected industries for future implementation.

According to the International Energy Agency if all methane leaks from fossil fuel operations in 2021 had been captured and sold then gas markets would have been supplied with an additional 180 Bcm of gas.

The IEA said that was equivalent to all the gas used in Europe's power sector. Marketing gas that is lost would also be profitable for producers given sustained high international gas prices.

Using the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Atlassian fair value estimate is US$279

Atlassian's US$195 share price signals that it might be 30% undervalued

Analyst price target for TEAM is US$213 which is 24% below our fair value estimate

Does the December share price for Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM) reflect what it's really worth? Today we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. It may sound complicated but actually it is quite simple!

We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However a DCF is just one valuation metric among many and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model.

See our latest analysis for Atlassian

The Model

We use what is known as a 2-stage model which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.

A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate

2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($ Millions) US$984.0m US$1.28b US$1.60b US$2.16b US$2.91b US$3.48b US$3.98b US$4.41b US$4.77b US$5.07b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x16 Analyst x19 Analyst x9 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 19.60% Est @ 14.38% Est @ 10.74% Est @ 8.18% Est @ 6.39% Present Value ($ Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$918 US$1.1k US$1.3k US$1.6k US$2.1k US$2.3k US$2.5k US$2.5k US$2.6k US$2.5k

(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)

Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$19b

Story continues

After calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period we need to calculate the Terminal Value which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.2%.

Terminal Value (TV)= FCF 2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.1b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.2%) = US$105b

Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$105b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$53b

The total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value which results in the Total Equity Value which in this case is US$72b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$195 the company appears quite good value at a 30% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though that this is just an approximate valuation and like any complex formula - garbage in garbage out.

Important Assumptions

We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry or a company's future capital requirements so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Atlassian as potential shareholders the cost of equity is used as the discount rate rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2% which is based on a levered beta of 0.989. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0 which is a reasonable range for a stable business.

SWOT Analysis for Atlassian

Strength

Debt is not viewed as a risk.

Weakness

No major weaknesses identified for TEAM.

Opportunity

Forecast to reduce losses next year.

Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.

Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.

Threat

Not expected to become profitable over the next 3 years.

Moving On:

Whilst important the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Atlassian there are three fundamental factors you should assess:

Risks: Take risks for example - Atlassian has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.

One of the most closely followed stocks on Wall Street is Tesla (TSLA 4.16%). The electric vehicle (EV) pioneer has earned a market-leading position in the automobile industry thanks to relentless innovation and a loyal customer base. Moreover the influence Tesla has within the auto industry cannot be overstated. Over the last several years the EV space has welcomed a plethora of new entrants such as Rivian Automotive Polestar Lucid Group and more.

With this rise in competition Tesla has been forced to show its hand. Over the last year the company has resorted to aggressive price cuts in order to maintain its market position and combat a two-way battle from increased competition and macroeconomic challenges such as inflation. While the strategy appears to be working it's clear that Tesla needs to do more. After all the EV market is still fairly nascent and Tesla's starting price tag upward of $40000 could be considered a luxury purchase.

Nonetheless a few weeks ago it was revealed that Tesla has a new model in the works -- and this could finally be the draw that causes the competition to fold. The best part about this development is that it doesn't seem to be garnering typical levels of media attention when it comes to Tesla making now an interesting time to build around a long-term position.

Tesla's new model

One of the longest-running Tesla bulls is wealth manager Ron Baron. Baron recently sat down with CNBC to talk about all things Tesla from its battery technology to autonomous driving ambitions. However during this particular segment Baron revealed a little tidbit that investors have long been suspicious about. More specifically he shed some light into Tesla's vision of a more affordable EV.

So what?

Tesla's lower-end models can sell for nearly $45000. And just like with any car manufacturer the more specs that you opt for in your Tesla the more expensive it becomes. While car ownership in general can be costly EVs seem to exist in an entirely different orbit. Replacing hardware or battery parts in an EV is a bit more challenging than getting an oil change or having a mechanic check your breaks. For this reason one of the biggest drawbacks of purchasing an EV is the total cost of ownership.

Per Baron's interview on CNBC Tesla is reportedly working on a 25000 euro (about $27250) vehicle in Germany -- its most affordable option yet. Tesla's unconventional CEO Elon Musk has been dropping hints about a lower-cost vehicle for years. This move by Tesla makes a ton of sense.

First a lower tier price option immediately provides Tesla with more optionality and commercial appeal. What I mean by that is a lower price point will likely result in more people at least considering owning a Tesla. By broadening its base of potential buyers Tesla is effectively acquiring more market share. Stated differently some buyers will gravitate toward Tesla before any other EV manufacturer purely because of this newfound affordability.

Additionally by creating a new model that is specifically marketed as a more affordable option relative to Tesla's other vehicles the company should (in theory) be able to reduce its price cuts. By doing so Tesla's average revenue per vehicle should tick up thereby spurring a return to accelerating top-line growth. More importantly the company's gross margin per car should increase as well which will bolster Tesla's already massive pile of free cash flow and continue allowing the company to invest in other growth areas.

Finally should the $28000 vehicle prove successful in Europe it's only a matter of time before Musk brings the affordable option worldwide.

What should investors expect?

The biggest variable surrounding the new Tesla model is the timeline. Baron alluded that production could begin sometime in 2024. Assuming this is accurate it's reasonable to believe that Tesla could begin selling the car by 2025. To be candid my personal view is that this timeline is a bit aggressive. While Wall Street has picked many gripes with Musk over the years perhaps the biggest revolves around ambitious release dates for some products and services. While Tesla has done an amazing job pushing EV adoption forward the company has a history of missing deadlines.

As an investor in Tesla I am happy just to know that the company is finally developing a lower-priced model. I would not buy Tesla stock today expecting that this new car becomes a billion-dollar revenue stream within the next 12 months or so. As I've written about previously Tesla has a lot of exciting potential catalysts -- and this new car is just another item on its growing list.

With that said long-term investors should seriously consider dollar-cost averaging more shares right now. I would not get too hung up on when the lower-cost vehicle will be commercially available just yet. Instead I'd take advantage of the recent sentiment surrounding Tesla stock and nibble on some shares with the plan to hold long term. Missed deadlines or not the chart above shows that Tesla stock has been incredible to own for patient investors.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9ydHJlbmQuY29tL25ld3MvdGVzbGEtY3liZXJ0cnVjay11bnBsdWdnZWQtcGVyZm9ybWFuY2UtdXAtaW52aW5jaWJsZS1hZnRlcm1hcmtldC1wYXJ0cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla's Cybertruck Is Here and the Aftermarket Is Ready,"We're only just now getting to solidify in our minds what the actual production version of the Tesla Cybertruck electric pickup truck is going to be like and the aftermarket is already out here bending our brains with fully decked-out stainlesswundertrucks.

Unveiling the 48-Volt Revolution

Tesla renowned for its trailblazing advancements in the EV realm has lifted the curtain on a comprehensive guide detailing the intricacies of 48-volt architecture which is used for ""steer-by-wire"" 4-wheel steering. Auto companies have been stuck at 12-volt for decades and Tesla had had enough of it.

This cutting-edge technology involves the use of a 48-volt electrical system in vehicles providing a multitude of benefits including enhanced energy efficiency faster charging capabilities and improved overall performance.

Tip: Enabled only by 48-volt architecture the Cybertruck has smooth 4-wheel steering to make handling incredibly easy.

The guide delves into the nitty-gritty of implementing a 48-volt architecture from the essential components to the potential impact on range and power delivery. This move by Tesla not only empowers current Tesla owners but also positions the company as a thought leader in the EV landscape.

A Strategic Slam Against Competitors

While many EV manufacturers have been racing to keep up with Tesla's technological prowess the release of this free guide amplifies Tesla's competitive edge. Tesla is worth more than all other automakers for a reason.

Here's why Tesla's move is a game-changer and a strategic slam against its competitors.

Democratizing Knowledge

By making this guide freely accessible Tesla is not just pushing the boundaries of innovation but also democratizing knowledge. Other automakers often guard their technological advancements as proprietary secrets.

However Tesla's decision to share insights into 48-volt architecture signifies a commitment to advancing the entire EV industry rather than merely securing a competitive advantage.

Fostering Collaboration

Tesla's open-handed approach encourages collaboration within the EV community. As more manufacturers adopt 48-volt architecture a standardized approach may emerge leading to a more cohesive and interoperable EV ecosystem. This collaborative spirit stands in stark contrast to the traditional competitive dynamics in the automotive industry.

Raising the Bar for EV Performance

The guide underscores Tesla's dedication to pushing the boundaries of EV performance. By openly sharing insights on 48-volt architecture Tesla challenges other automakers to elevate their game. This move forces competitors to reassess their own technological roadmaps and strive for advancements that can match or surpass Tesla's offerings.

Strengthening Brand Loyalty

Tesla's decision to provide a free guide not only benefits the broader EV community but also enhances brand loyalty among Tesla owners. It reinforces the perception that Tesla is not just a car manufacturer but a company committed to advancing sustainable transportation. This goodwill can translate into stronger customer loyalty and potentially attract new customers to the Tesla fold.

The Road Ahead

As Tesla continues to disrupt the automotive industry the release of this free guide on 48-volt architecture signals a new era of transparency and collaboration within the EV space. While Tesla has set a high bar the challenge now rests with other manufacturers to rise to the occasion and contribute to the collective progress of electric vehicles.

In the rapidly evolving world of EVs Tesla's move is a reminder that true innovation goes beyond individual success—it's about propelling the entire industry forward. The question now is not just how other manufacturers will respond to this challenge but how this collaborative spirit will shape the future of electric mobility.

The Budapest Business Journal spoke with Konrad Bauer senior vice president of global business services about how the company performed during this period and local operational challenges.

BBJ: Two years ago the goal of Thermo Fisher’s shared services model was to be the transformative backbone of the company and the Budapest operations would play a critical regional role in that. What has happened since?

Konrad Bauer: In the past two years we have further expanded our footprint in Budapest from 500 to 800 colleagues and established a strong diverse culture. From a business perspective we extended our scope and created better end-to-end processes which I think is a unique offering. In that sense you see business services globally and here in Budapest move from pure execution to real value-added business transformation.

The second piece is that shared services help manage some of our challenges. We have built a procurement segment which helped with supply chain shortages and we are using the project management functionality to manage topics such as the current ESG regulations in the EU. Building on our success stories from the past five years we are looking at a future of further growth expanding the Budapest team and the global shared services organization.

BBJ: Hungary has struggled for several years with a labor shortage especially among skilled labor. How is your company coping with that?

KB: I think we see that especially when hiring people for multi-language roles.

BBJ: Do you find them?

KB: We are still finding the talent we need but it’s getting harder. I see it in three ways. First we as a company must ensure we have the right culture to attract talent. We have created an inclusive workplace culture creating an environment where differences are genuinely valued. We’re also offering an environment where you can do more than just transactional back-office work because you contribute to a global mission where our colleagues make a difference in enabling our customers to make the world healthier cleaner and safer.

Second we will also require more support for native language speakers to come to Hungary and work here; currently our team represents 37 nationalities. Finally it’s investing in your people. We firmly believe that education and talent development cultivate higher added-value jobs. You need to invest in training your people. Since we opened the Budapest center we had more than 8000 training sessions to help colleagues unlock their full potential.

BBJ: We seem to have forgotten COVID-19 and the disaster that it brought. Do you think that Europe is better prepared now? Is it taking measures to cope better with the next pandemic?

KB: During COVID we saw unprecedented speed in developing tests treatments and vaccines needed to keep the world safe. It also showed the power of collaboration between science industry and governments. The pandemic brought into focus the need for a more ambitious and sustained approach to preparedness. Governments must commit to long-term investments in public health the resilience of healthcare systems and the ability to mobilize the right infrastructure.

I think there’s one preparedness level that is true for all governments and that is the sense we actually lived through it. On the positive side I think there’s a mindset people have understood that decision-making and certain actions must be taken much faster and that we have to live with the uncertainty because you can’t have it all figured out. And I think where we still have challenges everybody will anchor back to COVID.

But what will you do when the next pandemic is not an airborne virus but a bacteria that is water-submitted? We had all these business continuity plans and while many of them had pandemic reactions none had specific details about what we needed to do for what happened during COVID-19. I think that’s why pandemic response preparedness is tricky. I think what we need to do as a society is to train our agility to act.

(NASDAQ:ILMN) Potentially Undervalued?,"Illumina Inc. ( ) saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Illumina’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.

Is Illumina Still Cheap?

The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 19% below my intrinsic value which means if you buy Illumina today you’d be paying a fair price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $136.35 then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Illumina’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market providing a prime buying opportunity.

Can we expect growth from Illumina?

Investors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 67% over the next year the near-term future seems bright for Illumina. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock which should feed into a higher share valuation.

What This Means For You

Are you a shareholder? ILMN’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price with shares trading around its fair value. However there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?

Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ILMN now may not be the most optimal time to buy given it is trading around its fair value. However the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

We employed a murine bcr-abl oncogene-dependent CML model that recapitulates the development and clinical manifestations of human disease16. Specifically cross-breeding of SCLtTA and bcr-abl mice results in double transgenic animals in which expression of the bcr-abl oncogene and the subsequent development of CML is regulated by tetracycline (Tet) administration (Supplementary Fig. 1a). To standardize disease kinetics within a reproducibly defined temporal window we developed a murine CML transplantation model17 in which lethally irradiated wild type FVB mice are transplanted with bone marrow (BM) cells from SCLtTA/bcr-abl animals (henceforth referred to as CML mice) and then maintained on or off Tet. Recipients maintained off Tet exhibited weight loss (Supplementary Fig. 1b) along with a significant temporal increase in white blood cells (Supplementary Fig. 1c) and granulocytes (Supplementary Fig. 1d) in the peripheral blood. These animals also had a nearly two-fold augmentation in spleen weights (Supplementary Fig. 1e) and an increase in the frequency (Supplementary Fig. 1f) and absolute number of CD11b+ Gr-1+ myeloid cells (Supplementary Fig. 1g) consistent with what is observed in CML in humans1819. There was also a loss of normal follicular architecture in the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes due to the expansion of myeloid cells in these sites (Supplementary Fig. 1h i). In addition histological analysis of non-lymphoid tissues revealed accumulation of neutrophils in the liver and lung of leukemic animals (Supplementary Fig. 1j k).

Unexpectedly during the histological examination of the colon we observed that CML mice had a prominent number of cells with cytoplasmic eosinophilic granules that were morphologically consistent with Paneth cells (Fig. 1a). In addition whereas Paneth cells in the ileum of non-leukemic animals were located appropriately in the basal region of crypts Paneth cells in the ileum of CML mice were scattered throughout the villi (see arrows Fig. 1b). Staining of colonic tissue with phloxine tartrazine revealed characteristic Paneth cell granule affinity for phloxine (Fig. 1b). In addition electron microscopy also confirmed that these were Paneth cells as evidenced by the presence of spherical electron dense granules (Fig. 1c) and tight junctions which identified these cells as epithelial and not haematopoietically-derived (Fig. 1d). Paneth cells in the colon and ileum also stained positively for the secretory anti-microbial protein lysozyme (Fig. 1e) and for MPTX 1/2 in the ileum (Supplementary Fig. 2). We observed that there was a significant increase in the absolute number of Paneth cells in both the colon and ileum when compared to animals maintained on Tet alone (Fig. 1f g) indicative of Paneth cell metaplasia (PCM) in the colon and hyperplasia in the ileum. Analysis of antimicrobial peptide gene expression revealed a progressive and statistically significant increase in mRNA levels of cryptdin 1 and sPLA2 in CML mice demonstrating Paneth cell-specific gene expression (Fig. 1h i). To prove a direct and causal relationship between the development of CML and PCM we exploited the fact that the administration of Tet in the drinking water to mice with clinically evident CML reverses the leukemia phenotype and normalizes the WBC count in the peripheral blood (see Experimental Approach Fig. 1j). Transplant recipients in both cohorts were maintained off Tet for the first 35 days at which point the majority develop leukocytosis (Fig. 1k). Tet administration on day 35 to mice with leukocytosis and previously documented PCM (Fig. 1f) normalized the WBC within three weeks whereas animals that remained off Tet had progressive leukocytosis (Fig. 1k). Mice that had normalized their WBC counts also had resolution of PCM whereas animals with CML and off Tet had persistent metaplasia (Fig. 1l m). Thus there was a direct and causal link between the temporal development of CML and PCM within the colon in murine transplant recipients.

IL-9 drives Paneth cell metaplasia in CML mice

To delineate a mechanistic pathway by which PCM develops in these mice we hypothesized a role for IL-9 based on a report which had demonstrated that over-expression of this cytokine in a non-disease transgenic mouse model induced PCM in the colon20. To that end we observed a significant increase in IL-9 gene expression in the mesenteric lymph nodes ileum and colons of animals with CML but not in the bone marrow or spleen (Fig. 2a). Conversely expression of IL-9 in non-leukemic (Tet ON) mice was essentially undetectable in all these tissue sites. IL-9 receptor mRNA levels were also augmented in the ileum and colon but significantly reduced in the spleen of CML animals likely due to the expansion of non-IL-9R-expressing granulocyte populations (Fig. 2b). To assess the functional role of IL-9 in the induction of PCM we treated mice with an anti-IL-9 antibody and observed that these animals had increased weight loss (Supplementary Fig. 3a) and a significant time-dependent increase in white blood cell and granulocyte counts in the peripheral blood when compared to mice that received an isotype control antibody (Supplementary Fig. 3b c). While there was no difference in spleen weight between groups (Supplementary Fig. 3d) the absolute number of myeloid CD11b+ Gr-1+ cells were also significantly augmented in mice that were treated with anti-IL-9 antibody (Supplementary Fig. 3e) demonstrating that IL-9 blockade increased the absolute number of granulocytes in CML mice. With respect to the development of PCM the administration of an anti-IL-9 antibody to CML mice significantly reduced the absolute number of Paneth cells in the colon but not the ileum indicating that PCM was regulated by IL-9 (Fig. 2c d). Immunofluorescence images also demonstrated a reduction in Paneth cells in the colon but not the ileum in these animals (Fig. 2e). Anti-IL-9 antibody-treated mice had a corresponding decrease in mRNA levels of cryptdin 1 and sPLA2 in the colon and ileum when compared to CML mice that received an isotype control antibody as well as animals maintained on Tet (Fig. 2f g). Thus blockade of IL-9 signaling effectively abrogated the development of PCM in the colon and reduced gene expression of Paneth cell AMPs in both the ileum and colon of leukemic animals.

Metabolic profiling identifies histamine metabolites in the GI tract

The unexpected emergence of PCM in the colon and Paneth cell hyperplasia in the ileum of CML mice led us to examine whether other cellular and metabolic alterations occurred in the GI tract of these animals. To address this question we performed unbiased metabolic profiling and examined 973 biochemical metabolites in ileal tissue from leukemic (CML) and non-leukemic FVB recipients of syngeneic marrow grafts (FVB SYN). A total of 676 metabolites were differentially expressed (p < 0.05 cutoff) between these two cohorts with 292 metabolites overexpressed and 384 under-expressed in CML mice (Fig. 3a). Principal component analysis confirmed that CML mice differed substantially from non-leukemic mice with over 50% of the observed variance demonstrable along PCA1 (Fig. 3b). Hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated that biochemical differences were most prominently observed in amino acid and phospholipid metabolism (Fig. 3c). A more discriminatory and statistically rigorous metabolic analysis revealed that there were 59 overexpressed and 78 under-expressed metabolites between these two cohorts based on defined cutoff criteria (|log 2 (fold change)| >1.0 and p adjusted < 0.0001 (Fig. 3d) full list available in Supplementary Data 1). Examination of the top twenty most over-expressed metabolites in CML mice revealed that three of the top 10 were involved in the metabolism of the aromatic amino acid histidine. Specifically histamine which is directly downstream from histidine by way of the enzymatic action of histidine decarboxylase was the most highly expressed metabolite (144-fold increase) (Fig. 3e). Furthermore the downstream histamine metabolites 1-methyl-4-imidazoleacetate and 1-methylhistamine (Fig. 3f) were also significantly higher in CML versus non-leukemic syngeneic controls (Fig. 3g) indicating that there was activation of the histamine pathway in the GI tract that occurred concurrently with the development of PCM.

Fig. 3: Histamine and its downstream metabolites are over expressed in the GI tract of CML mice with PCM. a–g Lethally irradiated FVB mice were transplanted with BM cells from normal FVB (syngeneic FVB Syn) or SCLtTa/bcr-abl (CML) donors (n = 7–8 mice/group).

CML induces IL-9-regulated hyperplasia of specialized intestinal epithelial cells

Histamine is found solely in basophils and mast cells in the periphery; however only mast cells are tissue resident21. The histamine pathway metabolite differences that we identified in CML mice therefore prompted us to examine whether mast cells were increased in the GI tract of these animals and if their presence was similarly regulated by IL-9. This premise was supported by the observation that ileal tissue from CML animals had a ten-fold increase in serotonin which is also produced by mast cells (Figs. 3e 4a)22. Gene expression of the IgE high-affinity receptor (Fcer1a) which is present on all mast cell populations was significantly increased in the ileum of CML mice and correspondingly reduced in anti-IL-9 antibody-treated animals (Fig. 4b). Mast cells are present in two different locations (i.e. connective tissue and the epithelial layer) which can be distinguished by specific mast cell proteases23. To that end we found that expression of mMCP124 which is produced by both mucosal and connective tissue mast cells was significantly increased in leukemic animals but reduced in anti-IL-9 antibody-treated mice (Fig. 4c) whereas mMCP-7 which is produced by connective tissue mast cells was reduced in CML mice (Fig. 4d). Isolation of intestinal epithelial (IECs) and lamina propria cells from the colon revealed that mMCP 124 was predominantly expressed in IECs confirming that mast cells were confined to the mucosa (Fig. 4e). Immunohistochemistry staining with mMCP 1 which is mucosally restricted also demonstrated mast cell localization in the epithelial layer of the ileum in CML mice (Fig. 4f).

In conjunction with mast cell alterations we observed that there was CML-induced intestinal remodeling as evidenced by a marked increase in small intestinal but not colonic length that was partially attenuated by IL-9 signaling blockade (Fig. 4g). BrdU labeling demonstrated that small intestinal lengthening was associated with increased proliferation in the ileal crypts of CML mice (Fig. 4h i). This phenomenon has been observed in helminth infections where tuft cells respond to succinate and drive intestinal remodeling in infected hosts23. In that regard metabolic profiling studies revealed that there were increased succinate levels (Fig. 4j) as well as augmented gene expression of the succinate receptor (sucnr1) in the ileum of CML mice (Fig. 4k). Furthermore expression of the Tuft cell marker DCLK-1 (double cortin-like kinase-1) and IL-25 which is secreted by Tuft cells and regulates type 2 immune responses2425 increased in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4l) that coincided with the temporal kinetics of leukemia progression (Supplementary Fig. 1). Gene expression of DCLK-1 and IL-25 in the ileum of CML mice (Fig. 4m) as well as the absolute number of DCLK-1+ tuft cells were also significantly reduced by IL-9 signaling blockade (Fig. 4n o). Concurrent with tuft cell hyperplasia we observed that CML mice had an increased mucus layer that was present in the ileum (Fig. 4p). In addition these animals also had goblet cell hyperplasia that was significantly reduced in anti-IL-9 antibody-treated animals (Fig. 4q r). Expression of the goblet cell-specific gene Gob-5 which is a calcium-activated chloride gene involved in mucin production26 was augmented in leukemic animals although expression was not affected by IL-9 signaling blockade (Fig. 4s). Collectively these studies demonstrated that CML induced extensive intestinal remodeling characterized by the IL-9 regulated expansion of mucosal mast tuft and goblet cells.

IL-13 regulates tuft and goblet cell hyperplasia but not PCM during CML

Binding of succinate to the succinate receptor on tuft cells leads to the secretion of IL-25 which activates ILC2s leading to release of IL-1327. IL-13 is then able to promote the renewal of intestinal stem cells and their differentiation into tuft and goblet cells resulting in a feed forward loop28. The observation that succinate was increased in the ileum of mice with CML therefore led us to examine whether IL-13 in addition to IL-9 co-regulated the expansion of specialized intestinal epithelial cell populations. We observed that IL-13 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the ileum colon mesenteric lymph nodes and bone marrow of leukemic animals with differential expression in the ileum being the most pronounced (Fig. 5a). In fact the gene expression profile of IL-13 was similar to that of IL-9 in CML versus non-leukemic mice with the exception of the bone marrow (Fig. 2a). Administration of an anti-IL-13 antibody that had previously been shown to effectively inhibit allergic disease in mice29 had no effect on PCM or hyperplasia in either the colon or ileum respectively (Fig. 5b). There was however a significant reduction in crypt 1 (Fig. 5c) but not sPLA2 (Fig. 5d) gene expression in the ileum and colon of animals that received anti-IL-13 antibody. Conversely blockade of IL-13 signaling had no effect on gene expression of the mast cell markers Fcer1-a mMCP 124 or mMCP 7 (Fig. 5e–g) indicating that IL-9 and not IL-13 was the primary regulator of mast cell gene expression. Administration of anti-IL-13 antibody however did result in a significant reduction in the expression of DCLK-1 and IL-25 in tuft cells (Fig. 5h) and Gob-5 in goblet cells (Fig. 5i). In contrast examination of IL-5 another prototypical T H 2 cytokine demonstrated no effect of IL-5 cytokine blockade on gene expression of IL-9 or IL-13 in the ileum (Supplementary Fig. 4a b) expression of crypt1 or sPLA in the ileum and colon (Supplementary Fig. 4c d) or expression of mMCP 124 in mast cells or DCLK-1 and IL-25 in tuft cells (Supplementary Fig. 4e f). Thus these studies demonstrated that IL-13 regulated Paneth cell-specific gene expression along with tuft cell and goblet cell hyperplasia although this cytokine had no effect on the development of Paneth cell metaplasia or hyperplasia during CML.

To determine whether IL-25 whose expression was increased in the ileum of CML mice (Fig. 4l m) regulated the production of IL-13 as well as Paneth and specialized epithelial cell gene expression we treated these mice with a blocking anti-IL-25 or isotype control antibody. These experiments revealed that inhibition of IL-25 signaling had no effect on gene expression of IL-13 or IL-9 in the ileum (Fig. 5j) nor was there any difference in the expression of crypt1 or sPLA in the ileum or colon of anti-IL-25 treated animals except for crypt1 in the colon (Fig. 5k l). In addition antibody blockade of IL-25 did not alter gene expression of mMCP 124 in mast cells or DCLK-1 in tuft cells (Fig. 5m n) indicating that IL-25 had no apparent role in the upstream regulation of IL-13 or the expression of genes associated with specialized epithelial cell populations in CML mice.

Type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) are the primary producers of IL-9

To define the cellular source of IL-9 we considered that previous studies had shown IL-9 is produced by a variety of cell types including type 2 helper T cells3031 T H 17 cells3233 CD4+ regulatory T cells34 innate lymphoid cells35 and mast cells31. We therefore conducted an iterative approach in which we examined each of these cell populations to determine whether IL-9 production was detectable in these immune subsets. With respect to mast cells while we had previously shown that mMCP 124 was predominantly expressed in the epithelial layer within the colon (Fig. 4e) expression of IL-9 was confined to the lamina propria of CML mice (Fig. 6a). In addition immunofluorescence staining of colonic tissue revealed that there was no colocalization of mMCP-1 and IL-9 (Fig. 6b) indicating that mast cells were not the source of this cytokine within the GI tract. To determine whether T cells produced IL-9 we first examined the mLN since T cells are a prominent cellular component of this tissue and prior studies had shown increased expression of IL-9 in this tissue site (Fig. 2a). mLN cells were flow sorted into three populations (i.e. CD4− TCRβ− CD4+ TCRβ+ and CD4− TCRβ+ cells) and q-PCR was employed to demonstrate that IL-9 expression was significantly increased in CD4− TCRβ− cells when compared to CD4+ TCRβ+ and CD4− TCRβ+ T cells (Fig. 6c). Furthermore immunofluorescence staining demonstrated a lack of co-localization of CD3 and IL-9 in both the ileum and colon (Fig. 6d) indicating that T cells were not the source of IL-9. As additional confirmation we treated CML mice with an anti-CD4 antibody that depletes these T cells from tissue sites (Supplementary Fig. 5a). We observed no difference in IL-9 expression in the ileum and an increase in IL-9 expression in the colons of anti-CD4 antibody-treated mice (Fig. 6e). There was a modest decrease in the absolute number of Paneth cells in the colon but no difference in the ileum (Supplementary Fig. 5b) nor was there a difference in the expression of the Paneth cell genes crypt 1 and sPLA 2 in the colon or ileum with the exception of crypt 1 in the colon (Supplementary Fig. 5c d). Furthermore there was no difference in colonic or small intestinal length (Supplementary Fig. 5e) or expression of mMCP 124 DCLK-1 and IL-25 in the ileum (Supplementary Fig. 5f–h). In contrast nearly all IL-9-expressing cells in the ileum and colon co-expressed GATA3 (Fig. 6f) and the majority also had colocalized expression of KLRG1 (Fig. 6g) which are markers for ILC2s36. Quantification of IL-9 expressing cells in the ileum and colon from mice with CML revealed that an average of 92% and 95% of all IL-9+ cells in the ileum and colon respectively were CD3−GATA3+ providing further confirmation that these cells were ILC2s (Fig. 6h). Flow cytometry also demonstrated an increased percentage of ILC2s in the mLN and the colon (Fig. 6i). Furthermore we observed increased expression of ST2 (Il1rl1) and IL-17RB (Fig. 6j k) as well as IL-4 and IL-5 which are cytokines produced by ILC2s37 (Fig. 6l–n). Collectively these data identified type 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) as the primary source of IL-9 within the ileum and colon of CML mice.

CML induces the production of intestinal epithelial-derived IL-33

We then sought to define upstream events that induced the ILC2-mediated production of IL-9 in the GI tract of CML mice. Using a semi-quantitative histological scoring system we did not observe any difference in pathological scores obtained from colon samples of CML mice when compared to non-leukemic control animals (Fig. 7a). However despite the lack of overt pathology we did observe a significant increase in the percentage of neutrophils macrophages and dendritic cells in the colons of CML mice with neutrophilic accumulation being most pronounced and consistent with the granulocytosis that is characteristic of CML (Fig. 7b). Furthermore CML also induced an inflammatory environment in the GI tract characterized by increased expression of IL-6 IFN-γ TNF-α IL-22 and GM-CSF in the ileum and colon (Fig. 7c). In addition there were augmented levels of inflammatory lipids; specifically eicosanoids (5-HETE 12-HETE) glycerophospholipids (glycerophosphoserine glycerophosphoinositol)38 and mead acid39 in the ileum of leukemic animals (Supplementary Data 1 Figs. 3e and 7d). To determine whether this inflammatory milieu was associated with cellular damage we examined cleaved caspase 3 expression as a marker of apoptotic cell death. These studies revealed that there was increased expression of cleaved caspase 3 in the ileum and colons of CML when assessed by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 7e) as well as by western blot analysis (Fig. 7f g). High power images revealed a lack of co-localization of E-cadherin which resided in the cytoplasm and cleaved caspase 3 that was present in the nucleus of intestinal epithelial cells from CML animals (Supplementary Fig. 6). Prior studies have shown that IL-33 IL-25 and/or thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) are major activators of ILC2s40 and these cytokines function as alarmins that are produced in response to cellular injury and inflammation41. Given the cell death observed in the intestines of CML mice we examined gene expression of these cytokines and observed that mRNA expression of IL-33 was significantly increased in the ileum and nearly significant in the colon (Fig. 7h). Conversely IL-25 which was previously shown to be augmented in the ileum where there was tuft cell hyperplasia (Fig. 4l) was not increased in the colon (Supplementary Fig. 7a) and TSLP was decreased in both tissue sites (Supplementary Fig. 7b). IL-33 is localized in the nucleus prior to its secretion as a 266 amino acid protein42 that is subsequently cleaved by proteases from neutrophils and mast cells into smaller mature forms that have increased potency4344. Western blot analysis confirmed increased expression of IL-33 in the ileum and colon of CML animals which was attributable to the more potent shorter 15 kDA cleavage protein (Fig. 7i j Supplementary Fig. 7c e f h). Notably IL-33 localized to the intestinal epithelial cell layer as demonstrated by both western blot (Fig. 7k l Supplementary Fig. 7k) and immunofluorescence staining (Supplementary Fig. 7i j) indicating that CML induced the production of epithelial-derived IL-33.

IL-33 regulates the expression of ILC2-derived cytokines in the GI tract

To further define the upstream role of IL-33 and provide rationale for the predominance of more potent smaller forms of this cytokine in CML mice we examined proteases that have been shown to cleave IL-33 in vitro4344. We observed the expression of neutrophil elastase (Fig. 8a b Supplementary Fig. 8a c d f) and cathepsin G (Fig. 8a c Supplementary Fig. 8b c e f) as well as the mast cell protease chymase (Fig. 8d e Supplementary Fig. 7d e g h) were all significantly increased in the ileum and colon of CML animals providing a potential explanation for the observed smaller IL-33 cleavage product44. Since IL-9 has a pivotal role in promoting PCM and intestinal remodeling we then examined the effect of IL-9 signaling blockade on the production of IL-33 as well as proteases from these innate immune populations. Administration of anti-IL-9 antibody had no effect on the 35 kDA product but did result in a significant decrease in the 15 kDA cleavage protein in both the ileum and colon (Fig. 8f–h Supplementary Fig. 8n o p q). Inhibition of IL-9 signaling reduced expression of neutrophil elastase only in the colon (Fig. 8f i Supplementary Fig. 8g i j l) and had no effect on cathepsin G expression in the ileum or colon (Fig. 8f j Supplementary Figs. 8h i k l) In contrast expression of chymase was significantly lower in both the ileum and colon of mice treated with anti-IL-9 antibody (Figs. 8f and 8 Supplementary Figs. 8m o q) suggesting that mast cell-derived chymase was the primary mediator of proteolytic cleavage of IL-33. Finally to assess the functional role of IL-33 and determine if this cytokine regulated the expression of IL-9 and other ILC2-derived cytokines CML mice were treated with either an anti-ST2 or isotype control antibody. Inhibition of IL-33 signaling resulted in a significant decrease in gene expression of IL-9 (Fig. 8l) along with IL-4 IL-5 and IL-13 (Fig. 8m) but not IL-25 or mMCP (Fig. 8n) in the ileum of leukemic animals demonstrating that IL-33 regulated the expression of ILC2-derived cytokines."

A New Jersey trampoline/amusement center is coming to the former Kmart site off Route 40 in Bear.

A coming soon sign for Fun City Adventure Park was recently added.

Fun City operates a site in Blackwood NJ with another in the works in Millville NJ about an hour’s drive from Bear.

According to a past release the company currently operates 20 locations in seven states from Maine to New Jersey with 13 additional sites under construction or with signed leases — in New York Pennsylvania and Kansas as well as Delaware. One location slated to be the site of Fun City is in Millville NJ about an hour’s drive from Bear.

Fun City locations feature trampoline courts a Ninja course a ropes course a zipline dodgeball basketball a playground a battle beam a foam pit bumper ball bumper cars and an arcade.

It enters a crowded market with the upscale Main Event in the nearby Christiana area along with two nearby trampoline parks. The indoor sites are a popular location for increasingly lavish birthday parties and other events.

To the north big box giant Dick’s Sporting Goods is bringing in an expanded store Dick’s House of Sports Delaware Online reported. The concept expands the sporting goods store into adjacent space that will include batting cages putting greens a rock climbing wall and other features.

Work has been underway on the Fun City site with dumpsters in place and heating-air conditioner units added to the rooftop.

Bear may have been the last former Kmart site which was not occupied or under development.

The Bear Kmsrt space had been rumored to be the site of a Tractor Supply store although its format might have required the space to be divided.

Democrats in Michigan have warned the White House that Biden’s handling of the Israel-Hamas war could cost him enough to sway the outcome of the 2024 presidential election.

Leaders from Michigan Minnesota Arizona Wisconsin Florida Georgia Nevada and Pennsylvania gathered behind a lectern that read “Abandon Biden ceasefire now” in Dearborn Michigan the city with the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the United States.

More than 13300 Palestinians — roughly two-thirds of them women and minors according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-ruled Gaza — have been killed in the Israel-Hamas war. Some 1200 Israelis have been killed mostly during Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel that triggered the war.



Biden’s unwillingness to call for a ceasefire has damaged his relationship with the American Muslim community beyond repair according to Minneapolis-based Jaylani Hussein who helped organize the conference.

""Families and children are being wiped out with our tax dollars"" Hussein said. “What we are witnessing today is the tragedy upon tragedy.”

Hussein who is Muslim told The Associated Press: “The anger in our community is beyond belief. One of the things that made us even more angry is the fact that most of us actually voted for President Biden. I even had one incident where a religious leader asked me 'How do I get my 2020 ballot so I can destroy it?"" he said.

White House spokesperson Andrew Bates previously said the Biden administration has pushed for humanitarian pauses in the fighting to get humanitarian aid into Gaza adding that “fighting against the poison of antisemitism and standing up for Israel’s sovereign right to defend itself have always been core values for President Biden.”

Michigan Wisconsin and Pennsylvania were critical components of the ""blue wall"" of states that Biden returned to the Democratic column helping him win the White House in 2020. About 3.45 million Americans identify as Muslim or 1.1% of the country's population and the demographic tends to lean Democratic according to Pew Research Center.

But leaders said Saturday that the community's support for Biden has vanished as more Palestinian men women and children are killed in Gaza.



We are not powerless as American Muslims. We are powerful. We don’t only have the money but we have the actual votes. And we will use that vote to save this nation from itself” Hussein said at the conference.

The Muslim community leaders' condemnation of Biden does not indicate support for former President Donald Trump the clear front-runner in the Republican primary Hussein clarified.

“We don't have two options. We have many options. And we're going to exercise that"" he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnZpY2tzYnVyZ3Bvc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMDIvd2VhdGhlci1zZXJ2aWNlLXN0b3JtLXN1bW1hcnktdGVsbHMtaGlzdG9yeS1vZi10b3JuYWRvL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weather Service storm summary tells history of tornado - The Vicksburg Post,"Weather Service storm summary tells history of tornado Published 10:44 am Saturday December 2 2023

1 of 2

All it took was nine minutes to transform Vicksburg into a disaster area.

The 1953 Vicksburg tornado was probably the worst disaster to strike Vicksburg since the siege causing severe damage to homes and businesses and causing tragedy for many families and its history is best told by a National Weather Service summary of the tornado written after the storm and update.

From the time it touched down about 5:31 p.m. in eastern Madison Parish west of the Mississippi River until it ended about 5:40 p.m. north-northeast of the city the Dec. 5 1953 the Vicksburg tornado traveled 7 miles cut a path 500 yards wide killed 270 people injured 38 left 1200 people homeless and caused $25 million in damage (more than $288 million in today’s money).

It was one of five F5/EF5 tornadoes to hit the U.S. in 1953.

But on that Saturday the potential of severe weather was not on the minds of Vicksburg residents as they went through their weekend activities.

According to the Weather Service summary of the storm weather conditions were unseasonably warm for that time of year with temperatures beginning the day in the lower 50s – about 10 to 15 degrees above normal.

Clouds filled most of the sky but there were occasional peeks of sun and breezy occasionally gusty southeasterly wind. Sustained winds were measured as high as 17 miles per hour before noon at the U.S. Weather Bureau office in downtown Vicksburg.

Vicksburg residents were out enjoying the relatively warm early December weather taking advantage of the warm temperature for Christmas shopping. The streets were decorated for the season. While occasional showers wet the area they weren’t enough to stop a planned afternoon parade or a charity football game to help with medical bills for Leo Puckett a Jett High School football player who sustained a spinal injury during a September football game leaving him paralyzed.

According to the Weather Service summary a warm front lifted northward across the region during the day with temperatures rising to 72 degrees by mid-afternoon. The dew point reading at the Vicksburg Municipal Airport rose from the 40s that morning to almost 70 behind the warm front.

“In the increasingly moist and unstable air mass south of the front thunderstorms developed across central Louisiana during the day moving northeastward. In the upper atmosphere wind shear was also strengthening making conditions more favorable for tornadoes” according to the summary. At 1:30 p.m. the summary indicated the U.S. Weather Bureau’s Severe Local Storms Unit issued a severe weather bulletin indicating that “tornado-producing conditions” would exist in an area between Tyler Texas Little Rock Arkansas Clarksdale and Monroe Louisiana.

About 4 p.m. a tornado developed north of Ruston Louisiana. and tracked 8 miles through the town of Spearsville injuring 16. A another tornado developed farther east about an hour later leaving a 60-mile long path of damage that extended from northeast of Monroe near Spencer Louisiana and into southeast Arkansas.

At 5:30 p.m. a storm moving northeastward across eastern Madison Parish produced a tornado just west of the Mississippi River.

But tornados weren’t supposed to occur in Vicksburg. “They had always said Vicksburg would never have a tornado because of the river” longtime Vicksburg resident Marie Renaud recalled for the 60th anniversary of the tornado.

“Unfortunately many Vicksburg residents found out the hard way that this belief was merely a falsehood” the newspaper summary continued. “The tornado crossed over the Mississippi River bridge moving across the river to the southern tip of DeSoto Island where it downed several trees. As the tornado crossed the Yazoo Diversion Canal it took one of its first victims a fisherman whose body was never found.”

After crossing the Mississippi River the tornado became stronger as it moved through the industrial area along Levee Street southwest of downtown. “Significant damage occurred along the Vicksburg railroad and at businesses such as the Union Compress and Warehouse Company the Valley Gin the Levee Street Foundry and Machine Works the Vicksburg Transfer Company and the P.P. Williams Company” according to the NWS summary. “The tornado then began to move uphill from the river toward the downtown area demolishing several small shacks as it moved across Pearl Street Veto Street and Mulberry Street and into the central business district.”

The tornado caught residents in the downtown area off guard as it hit the city’s center. Many heard the storm coming moments before it arrived and made a last-ditch attempt to run into the back of buildings or basements for safety.

According to the summary as the tornado moved across South Street one eyewitness said the Farmer’s Tractor Supply Company “just exploded right in front of my face.” The company’s owner lost his life. In the same block the summary continued several businesses were hit along Washington Street most notably Mississippi Hardware and Ben Warren’s Clothing Store.

“Those two buildings almost completely collapsed trapping several individuals including many who were seeking shelter in the basement at Mississippi Hardware. Two lives were lost at Ben Warren’s Clothing Store including a daughter of the owner.

The twister caused more severe damage as it crossed Crawford Street hitting numerous businesses along Washington Street including the Sports Shop Palermo’s Mens Shop and the S.H. Kress Dime Store. Two people died at Palermo’s including a customer and the son of the owner.

A block to the east the tornado heavily damaged St. Paul Catholic Church. The historic church building was not leveled by the tornado but the structure was later determined to be unsound and was rebuilt.

The tornado continued across Clay Street damaging First National Bank the Jefferson Davis Hotel the Hotel Vicksburg and caused a partial wall and roof collapse at the Strand Theatre.

Damage to another theater however would result in tragedy.

The Saenger Theater located at 1209 Walnut St. was in the center of the tornado’s path. Before the tornado hit according to the summary the power flickered and eventually went off. Then light suddenly reappeared in the large theatrer as a wall collapsed bringing the screen down. The ceiling collapsed trapping several people under their seats and debris. Five children died at the theater each under the age of 10.

According to the summary three women were initially trapped in the destroyed theater for several hours before being rescued. Among those was Lillian Mitchell who was at the theater with her two daughters who were killed when the theater collapsed.

Mitchell who was seven months pregnant was taken to the maternity ward at Mercy Hospital where three days later she gave birth to a third daughter.

After hitting the Saenger Theater the tornado continued north across China Street wrecking the Keith Williams Chrysler-Plymouth dealership then northward across Grove Street where another fatality occurred. The storm crossed Monroe Street clipping the Old Courthouse before hitting the Happyland Nursery where two toddlers died. Another fatality occurred as the tornado crossed Cherry Street near the intersection with Main Street.

“At this point the Joe Wing Sing grocery store was demolished about two blocks outside of the tornado’s main damage path at the corner of Openwood Street and Farmer Street” the summary continued. “It is believed this may have been a satellite tornado that developed on the periphery of the main cyclone.”

Moving north the tornado caused severe damage in a residential area on the north side of the city.

Many homes along Adams Street Randolph Street Fayette Street Jefferson Street Locust Street and the surrounding areas were completely leveled. At least three deaths occurred in this neighborhood including a mother and daughter. The tornado then moved into the western portion of the Vicksburg National Military Park crossing Confederate Avenue and causing considerable damage from the Fort Hill area eastward to the observation tower that once stood on that side of the park.

“Residences were then damaged along Union Avenue also in the park” the summary added continuing “As the tornado exited the park it moved into the Waltersville community. Along Sherman Avenue 17 homes and a church were destroyed. A man died at this location possibly the last life taken by the storm as it moved northward into a more rural wooded area and dissipated.”

In 1953 people didn’t have access to the different forms of media that would be available 70 years later and news of the tornado was slow to reach others outside Vicksburg.

According to the Weather Service summary the Jackson Weather Bureau first received word about 20 to 30 minutes after the tornado occurred. The observation form from the Hawkins Field office in Jackson reported at noted at 5:58 p.m. “State Highway Patrol reports unconfirmed tornado at Vicksburg Miss. moving NE. Damage unknown. Power out at present.”

A later MHP update at 6:10 p.m. confirmed a tornado hit Vicksburg.

In the wake of the twister victims were trapped in several downtown buildings for hours and some into the following day.

“Downtown Vicksburg would never look the same again” the summary added.

“In the immediate aftermath of the tornado emergency personnel the Mississippi National Guard the Red Cross private citizens and many others rushed to the scene of the devastation to help find survivors” the summary continued. “Even after the tornado winds remained gusty with occasional showers moving through the downtown area hampering relief efforts to some extent.”

On Dec. 5 1953 according to the summary “There were 19 confirmed tornadoes including a violent F4 tornado that hit the northwest side of Alexandria La. and an even more violent F5 tornado that hit Vicksburg Miss. In all the tornadoes killed 49 people injured 404 others and caused $45709 million ($526.7 million in 2023) in damage.

As part of the announcement the Governments of Chile the Dominican Republic Nigeria and the Philippines expressed interest in participating in the ETA. Amazon Bank of America Boston Consulting Group Mastercard McDonald's Morgan Stanley PepsiCo Salesforce Schneider Electric Standard Chartered Bank Trane Technologies and Walmart have expressed interest in continuing to engage with the ETA partners as the initiative moves towards its formal launch.

Leaders unveil the Energy Transition Accelerator Framework at COP28

According to the International Energy Agency clean energy investment in developing and emerging economies excluding China must increase seven-fold to $1.9 trillion a year by the early 2030s to keep a 1.5°C limit on warming within reach.

During today's announcement at the U.S. Center at COP28 the three ETA partners announced several major achievements since their partnership's creation at COP27 one year ago and their aim to formally establish the ETA as an independent initiative by Earth Day 2024.

The ETA will bring together governments and private sector stakeholders employing high-integrity carbon crediting to deliver faster deeper greenhouse gas reductions and improve the lives of vulnerable people by accelerating the transition from fossil fuels to clean power in developing and emerging economies. Based on preliminary estimates the ETA could mobilize anywhere from $72 billion to $207 billion in transition finance by 2035.

After a year of extensive consultations with government business and civil society stakeholders the partners released the core ETA framework which will serve as a foundation for the creation of the ETA Coalition. The framework describes the Coalition and its objectives and provides an overview of key elements of the ETA: its approach to carbon crediting including the development of an independent sectoral-scale crediting standard for emissions reductions from electricity generation; criteria for participating companies and information on how they would use ETA carbon credits to help meet their voluntary climate commitments; just transition provisions to address worker and community needs; plans to dedicate a portion of the finance generated to address adaptation and resilience in vulnerable countries; and options for innovative financial structures to mobilize investment into energy transition strategies.

The partners were joined by countries and leading companies declaring their interest in engaging with the ETA partners in the continued development of the groundbreaking initiative. The governments of Chile the Dominican Republic and Nigeria announced they would be joining the ETA as pilot countries.

Ten leading companies signed a letter of interest welcoming the ETA as an opportunity to support large-scale power sector transformation while accelerating progress towards their ambitious climate goals: Amazon Bank of America Boston Consulting Group Mastercard McDonald's Morgan Stanley PepsiCo Salesforce Schneider Electric and Standard Chartered Bank.

""I am absolutely convinced we can meet our climate goals – the question is will we do it in time to avoid the worst consequences of the crisis"" said John Kerry U.S. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate. ""We all know the challenges we face and that no government can solve this alone. We must all come together with the innovative solutions to catalyze the financing at the scale and speed required to transition off of dirty power and accelerate the clean energy future.""

""We know how to solve the climate crisis. Now we need innovative ways to finance it"" said Dr. Andrew Steer President and CEO of the Bezos Earth Fund. ""The Energy Transition Accelerator brings a market-based solution to the table in turn unlocking billions of dollars for clean energy. Countries and companies joining us will be guided by high-integrity methodologies and just transition safeguards that center environmental and social impact.""

""If we invest in the climate response correctly it can become a vehicle for human progress. The Energy Transition Accelerator's framework begins to answer the essential question of how we can help emerging and developing economies achieve their climate goals while simultaneously creating economic opportunities for vulnerable people in developing economies"" said Dr. Rajiv J. Shah President The Rockefeller Foundation.

In parallel Winrock International released draft elements of the sectoral-scale carbon crediting standard it is developing for use by the ETA as part of the broader ETA Framework.

In September the ETA announced a strategic collaboration with the World Bank's Scaling Climate Action by Lowering Emissions (SCALE) partnership the aims of which is to catalyze climate action by mobilizing finance for effective energy transitions enabling developing countries to be directly rewarded for verified emissions reductions from a pool of payments committed by public and private sector contributors.

""At the global level the Bank through initiatives like Scaling Climate Action by Lowering Emissions is partnering with the Energy Transition Accelerator to remove the most critical impediments for carbon market expansion including setting standards and supporting countries access more affordable finance by helping them set up the necessary infrastructure to connect to a global market"" said Ajay Banga President World Bank Group who joined the ETA partners on stage from COP28.

The sectoral-scale crediting approach being pioneered by the ETA will incentivize participating countries to intensify their near-term activities contributing to power sector decarbonization including to deploy and utilize clean power and retire fossil fuel assets to enhance storage capacity transmission and distribution and for any needed policy shifts.

The ETA partners received extensive input from a High-Level Consultative Group of more than 30 experts and intergovernmental private sector and civil society leaders from all regions of the world. They have been supported in the design effort by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions (C2ES) the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) the Climate Policy Initiative (CPI) and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ).

""The math is clear: we are falling short of the finance we need to drive a global just transition"" said Fred Krupp President Environmental Defense Fund (EDF). ""To fill this gap we need innovative financing—including through leveraging carbon markets—that can mobilize the resources that developing countries need to secure a cleaner energy future. The energy transition isn't just about climate action it must also be focused on improving health expanding affordable energy access and creating economic opportunity along the way. EDF is proud to have developed the Just Transition Framework for the Energy Transition Accelerator guiding it toward a holistic approach with justice and equity at its core.""

""We cannot tackle the climate crisis without urgently phasing out unabated fossil-fired electricity generation and replacing it with zero-carbon energy around the world. And as developing countries continue to face the worst impacts of the climate crisis the rapid transition to clean energy is vital to strengthening their resilience and boosting economic growth"" said Nat Keohane President C2ES. ""The Energy Transition Accelerator can make a vital contribution to this transition by mobilizing a new source of climate finance serving to bring together companies and others seeking to buy high-quality carbon credits with developing countries that are poised to invest. The ETA's innovative sectoral-scale crediting approach and its emphasis on ensuring a just transition in participating countries will help developing economies move to clean energy at the scale and speed needed while providing companies with an additional high-integrity means of reducing emissions as part of their corporate climate strategies. C2ES looks forward to continuing to work with the partners and stakeholders involved in the ETA to continue to refine the ETA framework and bring it to fruition.""

NEWS RELEASE

MICHIGAN ATTORNEY GENERAL DANA NESSEL

************************

A cybersecurity breach at Welltok Inc. the software company contracted to provide communications services to Corewell Health’s southeastern Michigan properties has reportedly affected more than one million Michigan residents Attorney General Dana Nessel announced.

The names dates of birth email addresses phone numbers medical diagnoses health insurance information and Social Security numbers for about one million Corewell Health patients were compromised in the breach. In addition the names addresses and health insurance identification numbers of 2500 users of the healthy lifestyle portal for Priority Health an insurance plan owned by Corewell were also compromised according to a statement from the health system earlier this month. In total the breach affected nearly 8.5 people nationally.

The attack which occurred on May 30 exploited software vulnerabilities on the MOVEit Transfer server owned by Virgin Pulse Welltok's parent company.

“Health information is some of the most personal information that we have” said Nessel. “If there was ever data that required heightened cybersecurity measures it is the information held by the healthcare sector. This kind of breach has occurred too often and patients deserve to feel confident that their health data is protected in the most robust way possible. My office remains committed to helping Michigan residents keep their data private and secure.”

Welltok has confirmed that those affected include people who have received health care or insurance provided by the following companies:

Asuris Northwest Health

BridgeSpan Health

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota and Blue Plus

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas

Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina

The group health plans of Stanford Health Care of Stanford Health Care Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital Stanford Stanford Health Care Tri-Valley Stanford Medicine Partners and Packard Children’s Health Alliance

The Guthrie Clinic

According to the HIPAA Journal this cyberattack marks the fourth-largest healthcare data breach in the U.S. this year. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported that data breaches among healthcare organizations more than doubled from 2019 to 2021. In 2022 at least 28.5 million healthcare records were breached nationwide.

Michigan in particular has experienced a surge in healthcare-related cyberattacks. In recent months Attorney General Nessel notified Michigan residents about a ransomware attack affecting 2.5 million McLaren Health Care patients. Similarly the University of Michigan faced a cyberattack in late August leading to the compromise of personal information including Social Security numbers driver’s license or other government-issued ID numbers and medical records.

If Welltok has a valid mailing address on file the company is mailing a notice letter to individuals whose information was determined to be in the affected files. Anyone who does not receive a notice letter but would like to know if they are affected or has other questions may call the Welltok dedicated assistance line at 800-628-2141.

Although potentially impacted individuals should be receiving a notice letter from Welltok state law does not currently require companies who experience a data breach to share that information with the Department of Attorney General. The Department often learns about these data breaches through media reports. The AG strongly recommends the legislature – similar to many other states – strengthen our law to require companies who experience a data breach to immediately inform the Department of Attorney General. This will allow the Attorney General to more quickly alert the public.

“Michigan simply must catch up to the states that require Attorney General notification of these significant breaches” added Nessel. “To fulfill our duties of consumer protection and corporate oversight the Department of Attorney General must be alerted to these breaches when personal health and identifying information that is so often used to commit identity crimes is compromised and made unsecure.”

In a world full of amazing tech gadgets and near-miraculous medical breakthroughs it is hard to get too excited about airplane parts. But one under-the-radar aerospace supplier has generated returns for investors over the years that put all but the best tech investments to shame.

TransDigm Group (TDG -1.35%) an assembly of parts businesses few have heard of has more than quadrupled the performance of the S&P 500 over the past decade when factoring in dividends. Since the beginning of 2010 the stock is up more than 1900%.

That's in the past but TransDigm's formula for delivering market-beating returns shows no signs of slowing. TransDigm through the years has made investors rich. Here's why it is still an intriguing investment today.

Software-like margins from spare parts?

TransDigm's stated goal is to ""provide private equity like returns with the liquidity of a public market."" Like private equity firms the company uses cash and debt to roll up small companies and unwanted divisions of aerospace rivals.

The company is a collection of 48 semiautonomous units all focused on making parts that are both rare and necessary avoiding more commonplace parts like fasteners that can be commoditized in favor of items that have patent protection or are hard to replicate. About 90% of sales come from what TransDigm calls ""unique proprietary products.""

It also focuses on spare parts over supplying new airplanes with most of its earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) coming from the so-called aftermarket. If an airline customer desperately needs a certain unique part to fly 250 people from Seattle to New York the customer is not likely to be price sensitive when sourcing that part. That's TransDigm's edge.

The net result is that TransDigm is profitable at levels almost unheard of in the aerospace business generating an EBITDA margin of 52% in the most recent quarter. And about 80% of TransDigm's total costs are variable meaning the company can quickly trim costs in the event demand falls.

TransDigm critics have called those margins unsustainable but the company has been able to consistently generate steady returns for more than two decades.

What could go wrong?

Though TransDigm has been able to swat away criticism about the sustainability of its margins its profit levels have attracted other unwanted scrutiny. Defense sales account for a significant portion of TransDigm's total revenue and in recent years the company has been the subject of multiple government inquiries concerning its pricing strategy.

The most recent probe ended with a whimper but investors should be aware the questions are unlikely to go away.

As part of its private-equity style strategy TransDigm carries a lot of debt used for acquisitions. As of Sept. 30 the company had $19.9 billion in total debt or about 4.8 times its EBITDA. That's enough to set off some alarms but it is worth noting that the company has no major debt maturities until 2026 and so therefore has no immediate need to refinance into the current higher-rate environment.

The company's board felt confident enough about its balance sheet that it authorized a $35 per-share special dividend in September while also committing $1.385 billion in cash to acquire the Electron Device business of privately held Communications & Power Industries.

Why TransDigm can go higher from here

Perhaps the biggest risk to the bull case on TransDigm is if the company runs out of targets to acquire putting a cap on growth. It would appear the company is nowhere near reaching that point.

TransDigm expects to grow sales by 14% to 17% in its fiscal 2024 well above its pandemic-influenced 8.87% compound annualized growth rate since 2020. The Electron Device acquisition appears to be textbook TransDigm with the target generating about 70% of its $300 million in sales from the aftermarket and almost all of it coming from proprietary products that can't be easily copied.

TransDigm will likely never be a household name and its products are unlikely to ever be buzzworthy like an Apple phone or virtual reality (AR) headset. But sometimes these ""boring"" stocks can be portfolio all-stars.

The numbers don't lie: Investors who have ridden along with TransDigm over the years have enjoyed exciting returns.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9wZW5wci5jb20vbmV3cy8zMzEyODAzL2FpcmNyYWZ0LWVuZ2luZS1uYWNlbGxlLW1hcmtldC13b3J0aC02LTA4LWJpbGxpb24tYnktMjAzMNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aircraft Engine Nacelle Market worth $6.08 billion by 2030 growing at a CAGR of 7.73% - Exclusive Report by ...,"Aircraft Engine Nacelle Market worth $6.08 billion by 2030 growing at a CAGR of 7.73% - Exclusive Report by 360iResearch

Becoming an Even More Sustainable Combined Airline

Alaska Airlines is committed to building upon both Alaska Airlines’ and Hawaiian Airlines’ strong commitments to environmental stewardship including Alaska Airlines’ five-part path to net zero by 2040 and sustainability goals in areas of carbon emissions and fuel efficiency waste and healthy ecosystems. In 2022 Alaska Airlines made its largest Boeing fleet order in its 90-year history focused on the Boeing 737-MAX aircraft which are 25% more fuel-efficient on a seat-by-seat basis than the aircraft they replace and continued to expand use of route optimization software to help dispatchers develop routes that save fuel time and emissions.

These climate-focused efforts will continue including continued investment in local sourcing.

Compelling Strategic and Financial Rationale Generating Outsized Value Creation

The transaction is designed to deliver attractive value creation for Alaska Airlines’ shareholders while providing a compelling premium for Hawaiian Airlines shareholders.

All-cash transaction of $18.00 per share for a total equity value of $1.0 billion provides a compelling premium for Hawaiian Airlines shareholders.

Approximately $235 million of expected run-rate synergies reflect a conservative estimate of the transaction’s synergy potential; these exclude other identified upside opportunities that could be realized.

No anticipated material impact on long-term balance sheet metrics with return to target leverage levels expected within 24 months.

Hawaiian Air is still recovering from technical breakdowns earlier this year — while Alaska Airlines is looking to expand its international offerings.

“They’re formidable airlines. So I think it gives them a much better standing in the long term growth and survival in this really tough business” Forman said.

It’s been a tough year for Hawaiian Airlines.

After 18 years as the No. 1 airline for on-time performance it fell to no. 5 in 2022.

And earlier this year system upgrades caused massive meltdowns that delayed flights and stranded hundreds of customers.

“Alaska will come in and they will fix the things that are broken and maintain the things that are right ... which is maintaining that individual identity to and from Hawaii” Forman said.

“The best safety record of any airline and really attractive reputation as far as the airline to fly when you want to come to Hawaii.”

Forman expects some concern about how Alaska will handle redundancies in the acquisition but believes the carriers complement each other’s strengths.

“So much of Hawaiian’s strength Is the International flying they need wide-body airplanes.

“Alaska doesn’t have that. So they really are depending upon Hawaiian its airplanes and crews to do the vast majority of the heavy lifting” Forman said.

Meanwhile Forman said Alaska has Boeing 737s. “So you’re going to see that airplane in the long run integrate into maybe inter-island or some of the shorter runs.”

Forman says Alaska’s offer of $18 a share is nearly four times the value of Hawaiian’s an indication it’s undervalued. “Their stock price has been low over the last five years because of variety things that have happened — fare wars interIsland and that type of thing” he explained. “If Alaska is paying that much for it they have big plans for the airline.”

Forman added that Southwest sees Hawaiian as a smaller airline that would break in fare wars.

“Now with the financial backing of Alaska Air Group it’s no longer one big airline and a small airline. It’s two big airlines against each other so it’s a much more even playing field now” he said.

Forman added customers shouldn’t expect anything to happen right away.

“It’s going to be a very slow process and it’s mostly going to be things happening behind the scenes but remember they’re still very much competition” he said.

Upgrades to technology and aircraft can help both carriers better compete but while those changes are on the radar the merger itself could take up to 18 months to complete.

Dec. 3 (UPI) -- Alaska Airlines is buying Hawaiian Airlines for nearly $2 billion the companies announced Saturday. The two carriers were both originally formed primarily to serve the residents of America's 49th and 50th states who rely heavily on air travel for routine transportation as many parts of both states are accessible only by airplane or boat.

""Alaska Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines share a deep commitment to caring for their employees guests and communities"" a statement from Alaska Airlines said. ""This combination will build on the 90+ year legacies and cultures of these two service-oriented airlines preserve both beloved brands on a single operating platform and protect and grow union-represented jobs and economic development opportunities in Hawai'i with a combined network that will provide more options and added international connectivity for travelers through airline partners including the oneworld Alliance.""

Alaska said the acquisition will open more routes and provide more flexibility for air travelers though these types of acquisitions and similar mergers have proved to reduce competition and limit routes as the parent company consolidates routes to save money. Alaska Airlines will be forced to balance its future offerings with routes it has already been flying into Hawaii.

""I am grateful to the more than 23000 Alaska Airlines employees who are proud to have served Hawai'i for over 16 years and we are fully committed to investing in the communities of Hawai'i and maintaining robust Neighbor Island service that Hawaiian Airlines travelers have come to expect"" Ben Minicucci Alaska Airlines CEO said.

Alaska will pay $18.00 per share for Hawaiin in the all-cash deal nearly a billion of which includes assuming $0.9 in Hawaiian Airlines debt.

""Since 1929 Hawaiian Airlines has been an integral part of life in Hawai'i and together with Alaska Airlines we will be able to deliver more for our guests employees and the communities that we serve"" Peter Ingram Hawaiian Airlines President and CEO said.

""We are also pleased to deliver significant immediate and compelling value to our shareholders through this all-cash transaction.""

The statement says through airlines' combined partnerships and networks the new carrier will provide air travel options to 54.7 million passengers to 138 national and international destinations in the Americas Asia Australia and the South Pacific.

Honolulu will become a new hub for Alaska Airlines.

For passengers who travel from Hawaii the combination also triples the number of nonstop or one-stop destinations throughout North America they reach from the Islands while maintaining ""Neighbor Island"" service and increasing air cargo capacity which Alaska Airlines has mastered in the 49th state.

The deal is pending regulatory approval which is expected in the next 12-18 months. The boards of both companies have approved the sale.

Alaska also purchased Virgin American in 2016 for $2.6 billion."

Here's why things could turn around.

With one month left to go in 2023 stocks seem set to finish the year with a big win.

Through the end of November the S&P 500 index is up 19% while the Nasdaq Composite has jumped a whopping 36% this year paced by excitement over new AI technologies. In addition to the AI boom stocks have also benefited from a resilient economy generally strong earnings reports and inflation falling faster than expected.

However not every stock has been a winner this year. Among those that have struggled are regional bank stocks as the sector plunged in March when Silicon Valley Bank went under. Since then regional banks have faced pressure from elevated interest rates -- which have led to competition for deposits meaning they've had to raise the rates that they're paying for deposits -- economic uncertainty and the threat of tighter regulations in the aftermath of the crisis.

You can see the weak performance from iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF (IAT 0.96%) in the chart below.

The ETF is down by 22% this year underperforming the S&P 500 by more than 40 percentage points. However long-term investors know that this year's stock market trash can often be next year's treasure. Just look at tech stocks in 2022 versus 2023. Similarly regional banks which now seem undervalued look like good candidates for a recovery. Let's take a closer look.

A year to forget

The banking sector tends to be highly cyclical and that's even more true for regional banks which lack the diversification of national banks and have more exposure to small and medium-sized businesses which also tend to be more volatile.

Banks benefit from stable economic environments and 2023 was anything but that. In addition to the regional banking crisis the sector was buffeted by rising interest rates fears of a recession and expectations of tighter capital requirements.

However regional banks have actually performed reasonably well in this challenging environment. Take a look at the iShares U.S. Regional Bank ETF's top three holdings -- U.S. Bancorp (USB 1.13%) PNC Financial Services (PNC 0.61%) and Truist Financial (TFC 0.83%) which make up nearly 40% of the ETF's net assets.

U.S. Bancorp has reported an 8.3% increase in operating income to $7.1 billion though part of those gains is due to its acquisition of MUFG Union Bank (MUB).

PNC's operating income has increased a modest 1.6% to $5.68 billion over the same time frame while Truist was the only one of the three to post a decline in operating income falling 12% to $4.97 billion due to higher provision credit losses lower net interest margin and higher personnel expenses.

Altogether despite Truist's decline those numbers don't portray an industry in crisis or one that deserves a 22% sell-off.

Redemption for regional banks

Heading into 2024 there are a number of signs that things could improve for regional banks. Interest rates are expected to start coming down which could ease deposit rate pressures and encourage more lending especially in the mortgage market. Additionally economic growth is expected to trough and the beginnings of a rebound in the economy should support improving valuations in bank stocks as the risk of a recession fades away. A healthier economy should also support increased borrowing and consumer spending driving more business for the regional banks.

Considering that outlook the iShares U.S. Regional Banks ETF seems to trade at a discount valued at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 8.6 and offering a dividend yield of 4.6%.

Buying shares in the ETF is a good way to get exposure to a wide range of regional banks at a low price and take advantage of the generous yield. Investors should start to benefit from a recovery in regional bank stocks next year as the economy stabilizes interest rates start to come down and memories of the Silicon Valley Bank collapse fade.",,,,,,,,,

Beck Center. Or maybe there’s just something about Kentucky women’s basketball that has been hiding until recently.

Coming off a big win against Boston College on Thursday the ‘Cats remain undefeated at Transy (3-0) after beating Tennessee Tech 73-67 on Sunday afternoon. Kyra Elzy’s squad did it without senior point guard Maddie Scherr who is out with a head injury she sustained against Boston College. Also unavailable for Sunday’s game were guard Amiya Jenkins (shoulder) and forward Zennia Thomas (suspended indefinitely).

Kentucky defeats Tennessee Tech after an extremely chippy fourth quarter marking second straight win!



Ajae Petty leads all scorers with 33 points and 15 rebounds.



UK 73 | TT 67 | FINAL — Katie Hutchison (@KHutchisonKSR) December 3 2023

At the start this game looked like it might be a blowout. Kentucky went up 13-4 at the beginning of the first quarter shooting 9-18 (50%) from the field including three three-pointers — one by Saniah Tyler and the other two by Eniya Russell immediately off the bench.

Eventually Tennessee Tech began to live up to their three-point ranking (49th in the nation) and started to make some shots but finished 9-27 from three on the day. The smallest the Wildcats’ lead ever got was one in the fourth quarter. Then the game started to get chippy from the Golden Eagles.

First Cassidy Rowe took a hard fall in the exact same spot Maddie Scherr fell in Thursday’s game against Boston College. Rowe was shaken up but walked herself off the court. Almost right after Saniah Tyler takes a hard fall in you guessed it the exact same spot as Rowe and Scherr. Once again Tyler appeared shaken up but walked herself off the court. The Tyler foul was deemed intentional by Tennessee Tech’s Reagan Hurst. The guard committed two fouls in the same play. The second foul resulted in sending Ajae Petty to the line.

The standout for Sunday’s matchup was none other than Petty. The forward crushed her previous career best (19 in a loss to Austin Peay) by scoring 33. Petty boasted another career-high with 14 rebounds marking her third double-double of the season. The senior also added another career-high with three blocks in addition to an assist and a steal.

For the second game in a row Emma King also made a big impact. The senior had a career-high 14 points and career-high seven rebounds. King added another career-high with three blocks to go along with two assists. Besides King and Petty there were two other Wildcats who scored in double digits: Saniah Tyler (13) and Eniya Russell (12).

Tyler went 4-11 from the field and all of her makes were from the perimeter. Russell on the other hand didn’t start but immediately coming off the bench hit two three-pointers in a row. In only 25 minutes Russell went 5-12 (2-3 from three) and grabbed three rebounds and a steal. Cassidy Rowe didn’t score but instead made an impact in the assist column with a career-high of six. Rowe also took three charges.

For the Golden Eagles the only standout player was Maaliya Owens. The graduate student dropped 30 on the Wildcats going 8-16 from the field (6-12 from three). Owens added five rebounds two assists a block and a steal.

The Wildcats will be back in action on Wednesday Dec. 6 as they take on Minnesota at Rupp Arena. This will be the first game at Rupp since their Nov. 11 victory against USC Upstate. Tipoff is at 7 p.m. and will be shown on SEC Network+.",,,,,,,,,

The fire was discovered by an employee who was in another part of the company premises. However no one was injured. The fire which broke out at around 02:20 a.m. raged in a shed which is an outbuilding some distance from the main building. The firefighters managed to prevent the fire from spreading to the main building.

At around 9.45 a.m. cranes were used to open up the industrial hall to gain better access to the source of the fire. This initially led to more smoke which has now subsided. Nevertheless the fire department recommended that residents should close windows and doors and turn off the ventilation.

It is expected that the fire department will need hours and possibly even all day to completely extinguish the fire. According to Omrop Fryslân the fire was initially upgraded to GRIP-1 which means that various emergency services need to work together. On Sunday however the huge outbreak of fire was downgraded again to GRIP-0.

The agency says the total number of unrealized securities in the banking system at the end of Q3 surged by $126 billion – a 22.5% increase in the span of a few months.

Unrealized losses represent the difference between the price banks paid for bonds and the current value of those securities on the open market.

Although banks can simply hold their bonds until they mature they can become an extreme liability when banks need injection of liquidity.

The dangers of unrealized losses came into focus early this year amid the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.

The bank’s sudden failure back in March was sparked by an announcement that it had booked a $1.8 billion loss from selling a portion of its underwater bond portfolio.

Those losses stem from a historic collapse in bonds amid the Fed’s push to keep interest rates higher for longer.

In response to the failures of SVB and Signature bank the Federal Reserve launched the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP) which offers one-year emergency funding to banks in distress.

The FDIC says the banking industry’s profits margins have remained remarkably resilient although deposit flight continues.

“In the third quarter domestic deposits declined for the sixth consecutive quarter though the outflow of deposits continued to moderate from the large outflows experienced in the first quarter. The level of liquid assets fell in the third quarter due to a reduction in securities portfolios…

Though the U.S. economy has remained strong in 2023 the banking industry still faces significant downside risks from the continued effects of inflation rising market interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty. These issues could cause credit quality earnings and liquidity challenges for the industry.”

About 60 credit unions in the United States are experiencing outages because of a ransomware attack on an IT provider the institutions use according to a federal agency.

The video above is ABC13's 24/7 livestream.

On Friday the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) the agency that insures deposits at federally insured credit unions said in a statement to ABC News that it was ""coordinating with affected credit unions"" in the wake of the hack.

The full extent of the outage and its impact on credit unions was unclear Friday evening. One of the affected credit unions New York-based Mountain Valley Federal Credit Union told CNN that technicians from the hacked IT provider were ""working around the clock to get our systems"" back online.

According to NCUA spokesperson Joseph Adamoli credit unions reported that the ransomware attack in which cybercriminals typically lock computer systems as an extortion tactic affected a unit of Trellance a cloud computing firm provider used by credit unions.

NCUA told ABC News that the hack occurred through a third-party vendor FedComp using Trellance software which was the source of the cyberattack.

Trellance did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.

""Member deposits at affected federally insured credit unions are insured by the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund up to $250000"" NCUA said.

The Record a cybersecurity news publication reported earlier on the ransomware attack.

The incident is just the latest example of how ransomware attacks have caused havoc for U.S. critical infrastructure in recent years. Hospitals fuel pipelines and schools have also been disrupted by the file-locking cyberattacks prompting the Biden administration to treat ransomware as a national security crisis.

People who bank with PNC are noticing unauthorized charges and should check their balances reports the NBC-affiliated news station WPXI.

Tom Rubritz is one of the first people to realize something is wrong with his balance.

He noticed an unusual withdrawal hit his family’s account while his wife was out shopping.

“My wife was out shopping today so I went and was just checking on the account and looking at purchases and everything and I noticed a miscellaneous withdrawal of $11.72 in my account…

It’s a little concerning because it’s my money and nobody else’s. I was a little worried that’s how scammers work. They start small and then go big.”

The charges appear as “pending debit” with a random amount of money charged to the account.

A spokesperson at the bank says the unauthorized withdrawals are due to a “processing error” and its systems have not been compromised by hackers.

“Out teams have taken steps to resolve the issue which will correct any incorrect transactions displayed in customer accounts.”

The bank says customers do not need to reach out about unwanted withdrawals and says all erroneous charges will be automatically rolled back.

This is the second account balance issue at PNC in a matter of weeks.

On November 14th the bank said it was working to resolve a separate issue as a “limited number” of customers witnessed pending transactions pop up in their accounts more than once.

Ty Henderson's parents Todd and Aresha Henderson said he was catching an Uber ride home from basketball practice. Todd says police told the family the Uber driver was under the influence during the ride.

""He let it be known quick as day that it was the Uber driver's fault 100%. And I said what made you say 100%? He said because the Uber driver got took to jail for a DUI"" said Todd.

The accident happened just before 9 p.m. Thursday but Ty's parents say he was missing until 6 a.m. Friday.

""We text into FaceTime into his friends trying to get to see what was going on because it's not like him. He's a very responsible kid"" said Todd.

Aresha says she didn't sleep the entire night as she continued to look for Ty.

""My phone rang and it was the trauma nurse. She said this is Christine calling from UMC pediatrics. She said I just want to let you know that we have your son Ty here. And I said what?"" said Aresha.

The family says they were supposed to be enjoying the holiday season but Ty now has a long road to recovery.

""It's Christmas time. His Christmas is going to be spent sitting with neck braces"" said Todd.

""There should be some type of random testing for drug and alcohol to where you know you're not jeopardizing the people who are patronizing the company's life"" said Aresha.

Their app is experiencing technical issues and drivers say they're worried they may miss a lucrative weekend.

Many Uber drivers are not happy about the pause in services hoping they won't miss this weekend filled with potential rides.

Jake Parison has been an Uber driver for a few years. He says an update came on his phone Saturday on his Uber app and since that update he can't drive or see requests. He says the support team is looking into the issue and that it will be resolved in 72 hours.

""I talked to support and they said there's a glitch in the system and they can't fix it they're trying their best give them a couple of days and in the meantime me and my fellow drivers are losing money left and right.""

Not in time to benefit from the busy weekend due to the Steelers home game. He says other drivers are experiencing the same issue but the only response from Uber is they'll get them ""on the road soon.""

He asked them about lost wages and Uber said there was nothing they could do.

""With the Steelers game coming up tomorrow and everything we're losing a ton of money; it's one of the biggest days of the year besides New Year's Eve and Thanksgiving or Black Friday"" Parison said.

Uber riders are seeing a quadruple surge in pricing for rides as well.

""At the airport they definitely were. They were double. Sixty-nine dollars then $35"" said rider Jesus Tremillo.

With public transportation so readily available in metropolitan areas in Japan you may not have a need to call a taxi that often. Now you have an extra reason to though as Uber Japan’s recently added Premium EV option allows you to travel in eco-friendly luxury and even includes Teslas.

Since private-car ride hailing is still banned in Japan Uber which operates as a hired taxi service in the country has teamed up with taxi company Hinomaru Kotsu to offer this new feature in Tokyo neighborhoods in addition to the already available Taxi Premium and Premium Minivan options. If you specifically want to ride in a Tesla then once you select “Premium EV” choose “Tesla Model Y” and the stylish modern luxury electric vehicle will soon roll up to your location.

▼ Tesla Model Y

This is the first time Uber is offering premium electric vehicles as part of their service in Japan so if you’re a Tesla or EV fan you’ll definitely want to take advantage of it!

The service is somewhat limited for now. Initially Teslas are only taking passengers to Tokyo’s Chiyoda Ward Chuo Ward Minato Ward Shinjuku Ward and Shibuya Ward–all central locations for tourism shopping and dining–but the plan is to expand the service over time to more areas within the city.

Additionally there are only 30 Tesla Model Y’s dispatched at the moment though Uber and Hinomaru Kotsu intend to increase the fleet to a total of 100 vehicles by mid-2024. They may be highly sought after and tough to book but if you’ve always harbored a dream of riding in a Tesla (if not test driving one) it’s worth giving it a try!

CITRUS HEIGHTS Calif. — One person is in custody after a standoff involving a suspected stolen car in Citrus Heights.

The Citrus Heights Police Department said officers were called to the area near Ulta Beauty parking lot at Marketplace at Birdcage not from from Sunrise Boulevard and Greenback Lane.

MAKEUP lovers will rejoice at the complimentary service that customers are provided at Ulta Beauty as it makes purchasing makeup much easier.

However there's a catch as the beauty service you are likely hoping for is not free at Ulta.

FREEBIE

If you are an avid user of makeup then you know the struggle of buying the perfect shade of foundation or concealer.

Buying a shade too dark or too light for your skin can be frustrating and can ruin the look you were going for.

Luckily a TikTok user (@thebeautyadvisor_) that creates beauty videos and works at Ulta gave viewers the scoop on what services are free or not at the beauty chain.

In her brief video she makes it clear that customers can receive a color match for free but not a full face of makeup.

The first video subtitle reads: ""Life as a Beauty Advisor be like:"" and then she proceeds to clarify what is free and what is not.

The subtitles say: ""Customer: can you color match me?!"" followed by her shaking her head yes and ""Customer: can you also do a full face?!"" proceeded by her shaking her head no.

Although a free makeover would be amazing having the option of a free color match is still very helpful when deciding which concealer and foundation to purchase.

REDDIT CONFIRMS

On a Reddit thread users confirmed the information that was posted in the TikTok video.

One comment reads: ""Don't be afraid it's literally ulta employees' job to make product suggestions and match foundations. They will absolutely help you.""

Another user wrote: ""I can only speak to my ulta but they're really good about it don't care at all if you're bare faced will listen to what you want and aren't offended if you aren't jazzed about a suggestion and will happily work to get the right color and type.""

PAID SERVICES

A full face of makeup is not free but you can still opt for the paid options that Ulta provides.

If you are looking for that full-glam look Ulta offers a paid formal makeup application service.

The service lasts up to an hour and the price starts at $60.

You can add on strip lashes for $10.

Ulta also offers an everyday makeup application service which does not include eyelash application strobing or contour.

This service will cost you $45 and lasts up to 45 minutes.

The third paid service is a makeup lesson during which they will provide you with tips and tricks you can use at home.

This service starts at $30 and lasts up to 30 minutes.

In a video viewed more than 65700 times as of Friday TikTok creator Crystin (@cryswalker00) gives her viewers a public service announcement about her using her rewards credit card.

“PSA if you’re thinking of getting an Ulta credit card don’t f*cking do it” Crystin says. “These fools are so freaking shady.”

She then recounts how she used the card for a $50 purchase and after paying off the full balance she received a bill in the mail a few months later for $16.

After speaking with customer service she says she found out she was charged a $2 interest fee after paying the full balance. The representative she spoke to allegedly said late fees were piled on the $2 fee. She then paid the fees but got another bill in the mail—this time for $35.

“So I called him up again. ‘What the heck? Why am I still being billed? I’ve paid my card off twice now’” Crystin says. “They refused to take the fees off. They didn’t even really give me an explanation.”

“Now I have paid almost $100 for a $50 purchase” Crystin later laments. “If I get another bill from these fools…”

According to their website Ulta offers three rewards card options: a loyalty program that does not include a credit card a rewards Mastercard that can be used anywhere Mastercard is accepted and a rewards credit card that can only be used at Ulta Beauty stores.

The Daily Dot reached out to Ulta via email for further comment.

NerdWallet reported that the Ulta credit card includes a lack of reward flexibility and a high interest rate particularly if a person carries a balance from month to month.

Viewers of Crystin’s video sympathized with her experience.

“I work in credit cards ! You have to ask for a pay in full quote that will make sure any residual interest is covered and avoid this” user Marisol Valles (@@marisolvalles5) said.

“Ulta Sephora and Kohl’s credit cards are on our finance guy’s no list” user Devie Bunting (@deviebunting) said.

“I would sue them” user @itsbinnybaby said. “I did and got a check for $500 and the account officially closed plus the pending balance removed.”"

Alaska Air Group has agreed to buy rival Hawaiian Airlines in a $1.9 billion deal setting up another potential regulatory battle in the second proposed airline merger in less than two years. Alaska would pay $18 a share for Hawaiian and would take on $900 million of its debt the companies said Sunday. Shares of Hawaiian Airlines closed on Friday at $4.86 giving the company a market capitalization of about $250 million. They're down nearly 53% this year. The airline has struggled with challenges including the Maui wildfires increased competition from Southwest Airlines  which has ramped up service in Hawaii in recent years and a lagging recovery of travel to and from Asia after the pandemic. Hawaiian has posted net losses in all but one quarter since the start of 2020 while Alaska and other carriers have returned to more solid financial footing as the pandemic waned. ""What we saw here was a unique opportunity in time at the valuation that we saw Hawaiian at"" said Shane Tackett Alaska Airlines' CFO in an interview. He said the deal would also enable the combined companies to become a ""market leader"" in the premium-travel Hawaii market. Hawaiian's stock nearly tripled on Monday to $14.22 a share though still below the proposed purchase price. Alaska's shares lost 14.2% to end the day at $34.08.

Regulatory hurdles

Carriers have faced strong opposition from President Joe Biden's Justice Department when they have argued that they need to pair up to better compete with larger rivals. Earlier this year the Justice Department won a lawsuit to break up a regional partnership in the Northeast between JetBlue Airways and American Airlines . The Justice Departments also sued to block JetBlue Airways ' proposed acquisition of discount carrier Spirit Airlines . A trial is expected to wrap up in the coming days. Four airlines — American United  Delta and Southwest — control about 80% of the U.S. market consolidation that resulted from years of mergers. Hawaiian and Alaska said they expect the transaction to close in 12 to 18 months subject to approval by regulators and Hawaiian's shareholders. On a call with analysts on Sunday evening Alaska CEO Ben Minicucci expressed confidence that the deal will get approved citing 12 overlapping markets a combined 1400 daily flights and a larger network that he said would allow the airline to compete with the four largest carriers. ""We are hopeful that it will be seen in a positive light"" he said. The Association of Flight Attendants-CWA which represents cabin crews at both airlines said it would evaluate the deal. ""Our first priority is to determine whether this merger will improve conditions for Flight Attendants just like the benefits the companies have described for shareholders and consumers"" the AFA said in a statement. ""Our support of the merger will depend on this."" The combined company will be based in Seattle where Alaska Airlines is headquartered and be led by Minicucci. ""Given the transaction dollars we paid we feel this is strategically a step-change for us to accelerate not only our financial performance but the growth of our network"" he said said on the call.

Shift for Alaska

The two airlines said they will keep each carrier's brand but operate under a single platform combining into a 365-airplane fleet covering 138 destinations. Prior to pursuing Hawaiian Alaska Airlines acquired Virgin America for $2.6 billion in 2016. The Hawaiian deal is a major shift for Alaska. It operates Boeing 737s and it spent years whittling down Virgin's fleet of Airbus planes to streamline its fleet. Purchasing Hawaiian would bring a complex mix of Boeing and Airbus jets both narrow-body and wide-body planes under Alaska's roof. ""The Hawaiian brand will remain an important part of our home state with Honolulu becoming a strategic hub for the combined company and expanded service for Hawaii residents"" Hawaiian CEO Peter Ingram said on the call Sunday. The combination will allow Alaska Airlines to triple nonstop or one-stop flights from the Hawaiian islands to destinations throughout North America. It will also bring Hawaiian's long-haul flying to and from Asia under Alaska's umbrella. Hawaiian last year struck a deal to fly converted-cargo planes for Amazon . ""We will be closely assessing whether further dedicated freighter flying for ourselves or an asset-light model for others could make sense for the combined company over time"" CFO Tackett said on the call Sunday. Alaska Airlines said the deal should bolster earnings within the next two years with at least $235 million of ""run-rate synergies.""

By Rajesh Kumar Singh Akanksha Khushi and Anirban Sen

Dec 3 (Reuters) - Alaska Air Group Inc said on Sunday it would acquire Hawaiian Holdings Inc for $1.9 billion including debt placing a bet on a troubled airline with lucrative routes as U.S. antitrust regulators fight consolidation in the sector.

Alaska Air said it would pay $18 per share in cash close to four times Hawaiian's closing price on Friday. The whopping premium reflected how battered Hawaiian's shares were. The Maui wildfires high fuel costs and jet engine recall issues at some of Hawaiian's Airbus SE planes contributed to heavy losses and a 65% share price drop in the last 12 months.

The deal is bound to attract antitrust scrutiny

as U.S. regulators challenge

JetBlue Airways Corp's proposed $3.8 billion acquisition of Spirit Airlines Inc in court.

Antitrust enforcers have been suspicious of mergers between small airlines despite 80% of the U.S. aviation sector controlled by four players: United Airlines American Airlines Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines . They were successful in getting JetBlue in July

to abandon

a three-year-old alliance with American Airlines.

The tie-up with Hawaiian would give Alaska Air valued at $5.1 billion control of more than 50% of the market for Hawaii flights to one of the world's most popular tourist destinations.

""This is where people want to come spend time and vacation and have weddings and anniversaries. This is something that we believe that will remain strong for years to come"" Alaska Air CEO Ben Minicucci said in an interview.

He expressed confidence that regulators would approve the deal by the end of 2024 because the two airlines overlap in just 12 of the 1400 flights they collectively operate.

Alaska Air also defended its 270% premium offer as a bargain noting that the deal values Hawaiian at 0.7 times its annual revenue far below the industry average of 1.7 times. It added it expected a minimum of $235 million in annual savings.

Alaska Air approached Hawaiian to discuss a potential tie-up over the summer people familiar with the matter said.

Hawaiian posted a net loss of $159.3 million in the first nine months of 2023 smaller than the $189.9 million in the year-ago period. The Maui wildfires led to lower air traffic a 4% spike in jet fuel costs is weighing on its losses and issues with engines made by RTX Corp's Pratt & Whitney grounded some of its Airbus A321neo fleet.

Story continues

In an investor presentation Alaska Air noted Hawaiian's long history of profitability prior to those issues with operating margins fluctuating in mid-teen percentages between 2010 and 2019.

The deal is expected to generate high single-digit earnings gains for Alaska Airlines within the first two years with no material impact on long-term balance sheet metrics the company said.

After retiring the Airbus planes it inherited with its acquisition of Virgin America in 2016 Alaska Air has been only flying Boeing Co's 737 planes since end-September this year.

The combined company will operate a mixed fleet for now Minicucci said without ruling out future rationalization. It will be based in Seattle under his leadership and Honolulu will become a key Alaska Airlines hub.

The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) a trade union representing 600000 manufacturing and aerospace employees said it will take all steps to protect the rights of members at both carriers.

The combined company would maintain both airlines' brands an unusual move in an industry where waves of acquisitions have led to four big brands dominating the U.S. market. On Sunday the companies said Alaska will pay $18 in cash for each share of Hawaiian whose stock closed Friday at $4.86 after losing just over half its value in the year so far.

Officials from both companies called the deal a chance to combine two carriers with few overlapping routes which they said would create a stronger company to compete with the nation's Big Four: American Airlines Delta Air Lines Southwest Airlines and United Airlines. It would also create a “clear leader” in the lucrative $8 billion Hawaiian market Alaska CEO Ben Minicucci said in a conference call with investors.

“We combine two companies with shared values that have competed and survived longer than most through many industry cycles enhancing our differentiated business model and creating a stronger competitor to network carriers” he said.

The deal includes $900 million in Hawaiian debt bringing the acquisition's total value to $1.9 billion. The combined airline would be based in Seattle with Alaska's Minicucci at its head. The companies forecast the acquisition will add to profits within two years of the deal closing which is forecast to happen between 12 and 18 months from now.

The combined airline would participate in the oneworld Alliance which includes American Airlines British Airways and Cathay Pacific.

Alaska and Hawaiian are both smaller than the nation’s dominant carriers. They said the deal would meld two complementary networks increasing connectivity to 138 destinations for passengers traveling through the continental United States and across the Pacific including nonstop service to 29 international destinations in the Americas Asia Australia and the South Pacific.

Hawaiian has a deep and long history within the islands stretching back to its incorporation in 1929 under the name Inter-Island Airways.

The companies said they would keep Honolulu as a key hub and that they're “committed to maintaining and growing union-represented workforce” in Hawaii. Minicucci told reporters at a news conference Sunday that it's “too soon to tell” how many non-union positions would be eliminated once the combination is completed.

“I can’t tell you what that number is but I’m hopeful that the number is not large” he said of the potential layoffs.

The companies also said the combination would triple the destinations that can be reached within one stop in North America for travelers from Hawaii.

For example customers can not currently fly to Washington D.C. on Hawaiian but they would be able to through the combined company.

“Aloha everyone” Hawaiian Airlines CEO Peter Ingram said on a call with investors.

He said Alaska approached his company about a deal and that “the Hawaiian brand will remain an important part of our home state.”

The deal has been approved by the boards of both companies but it still needs an OK from the shareholders of Hawaiian Holdings. It will also need the blessing of U.S. regulators which have resisted more airline consolidation out of fear it could lead to higher fares.

The Biden administration is already trying to block JetBlue’s proposed $3.8 billion acquisition of Sprit Airlines which would subsume the nation’s biggest budget carrier. The Justice Department also won a lawsuit that killed a partnership between JetBlue and American Airlines.

The average domestic airline fare out of Seattle during the spring was $409.93. That was up from $293.08 two years earlier according to data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. The average domestic fare out of Honolulu during the spring was $367.94 up from $329.93 two years earlier.

But given how little Alaska and Hawaiian's routes overlap their proposal may not create much angst in Washington said Henry Harteveldt a travel industry analyst at Atmosphere Research Group.

Just as importantly he said neither Alaska nor Hawaiian is an ultra-low fare airline like Spirit. That means combining them would not eliminate the kind of downward pressure on fares that a Spirit buyout might.

The airlines will need to work with their unions as they try to streamline operations and corporate officials said they have spoken with collective bargaining leaders already. The Air Line Pilots Association said Sunday they were evaluating the proposal and awaiting more details.

Both airlines have historically paid more attention to their employees than competitors among other similarities in their corporate cultures Harteveldt said. It's another reason he said he thinks a merger between the two could work. ___

This story has been corrected to show that the company boards have already approved the deal.

Many companies with footholds in the space should sustain their AI-inspired share price gains over the long term and Nvidia (NVDA 0.79%) Palantir (PLTR 4.68%) and Alphabet (GOOGL 0.22%) (GOOG 0.12%) are three stocks in particular that should drive significant returns for investors.

If you've got $1000 to invest meaning you don't need it for bills in the short or medium term you've paid off high-interest debt and you've got your emergency fund set consider investing in these three stocks.

Nvidia is the king of the AI hill

Jake Lerch (Nvidia): Let's face it: No company has benefited more from the AI revolution than Nvidia. Its shares are up an amazing 227% year to date. Taking a longer view Nvidia's stock has skyrocketed over the last five years: A $10000 investment made in late 2018 would be worth an eye-popping $120000 today.

Nvidia makes the processors that power today's cutting-edge generative artificial intelligence applications. OpenAI's ChatGPT Adobe's Firefly and Microsoft's 365 Copilot among many others all rely on Nvidia chips.

What's more there are far more AI applications on the way. During Nvidia's recent earnings call Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress put it this way: ""Most major consumer internet companies are racing to ramp up generative AI deployment. The enterprise wave of AI adoption is now beginning.""

While tech titans like Meta Platforms Alphabet Microsoft and Amazon are leading the way AI has become crucial in a wide array of industries. Tesla needs AI to develop autonomous driving systems. Pharmaceutical companies hope AI will lead to breakthroughs in the treatment of disease. Companies like FedEx and UPS are implementing AI to optimize logistics.

You get the point -- AI will drive the next wave of innovation.

As a result Wall Street expects a financial windfall for Nvidia. Its revenue and earnings forecasts have already skyrocketed but they continue to rise as demand for the company's chips outpaces supply. Estimates for next fiscal year's revenue are through the roof. Analysts now expect the company to generate roughly $89 billion in sales. Nvidia generated less than $45 billion over the past 12 months.

The AI revolution is just getting started and for investors looking for a way to participate in it for a decade or more Nvidia is the stock to buy.

Palantir is proving its products' value

Justin Pope (Palantir Technologies): Investors have been interested in software company Palantir Technologies since it went public in late 2020. Part of Palantir's allure is due to its secretive work with U.S. government agencies and the military. But the company's progress in 2023 has gone a long way toward proving it deserves the hype.

For starters Palantir is gaining traction in the private sector. Its software platforms specifically Foundry fuse data analytics and AI to identify trends and aid decision-making. That can translate to things like improved supply chain efficiency for manufacturers and better bank fraud detection. The use cases are seemingly endless.

Palantir's commercial customer count in the U.S. grew by 37% year-over-year in the third quarter planting seeds for potentially robust long-term revenue growth. However Palantir's contracts can span years which means there can be lags between when a customer signs with Palantir and when it realizes meaningful billed revenue from the deal.

Momentum in its government segment has remained strong too. Palantir recently won a five-year contract with the U.K.'s National Healthcare Service worth over $400 million. Deals like this show organizations are choosing Palantir to solve complex problems. Investors must continue watching the company's pipeline of customers but there seems to be concrete demand for its services.

Financially Palantir is rock-solid. It converts over 20% of revenue into free cash flow and is profitable on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). It has $3.2 billion in cash and equivalents on its balance sheet and no debt. That's a war chest it can use to continue investing in growth or to make bolt-on acquisitions.

Palantir's future looks bright making it a no-brainer stock to hold for at least the next decade.

Alphabet is big but has room to grow

Will Healy (Alphabet): Even though Google parent Alphabet made itself an ""AI first"" company seven years ago many wondered whether it could match ChatGPT's capabilities when that application splashed on the scene. Also with its market cap already at $1.7 trillion one might wonder if its days of massive growth are over.

However it is probably way too early to count out Alphabet. The company soon responded to ChatGPT by releasing Google Bard. Unlike ChatGPT Bard can draw from Google's knowledge base to compose articles or code. It also takes from the company's extensive AI portfolio which has driven every one of its products since its ""AI first"" declaration.

Moreover with the emphasis on revenue coming from Google advertising and lately Google Cloud investors could easily forget that Alphabet owns numerous other businesses such as Verily Life Sciences and autonomous driving company Waymo.

Furthermore it holds about $120 billion in cash and short-term investments that it can invest in all of these businesses. Additionally in the first nine months of 2023 the company generated $62 billion in free cash flow. With that much money available to invest in AI it is unlikely to remain behind for long.

Alphabet's share price has risen about 55% since the beginning of the year taking its P/E ratio to about 26. While that valuation is well above the company's record low the stock has often traded at significantly higher earnings multiples. Between its P/E ratio and its nearly unmatched ability to invest in its enterprises Alphabet's AI prowess will likely keep making its shareholders wealthier.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWdsb2JlYW5kbWFpbC5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvY29tbWVudGFyeS9hcnRpY2xlLWRlbGl2ZXJ5LXRydWNrcy1hcm1lZC1yb2JiZXJpZXMtb25saW5lLXNhbGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Opinion: Robbers are attacking delivery trucks: A new vulnerability to all-important online sales,"Open this photo in gallery: An Amazon delivery truck at a fulfillment center in St. Petersburg Fla. on Nov. 20.OCTAVIO JONES/The New York Times News Service

Gus Carlson is a U.S.-based columnist for The Globe and Mail

There’s a group of new and dangerous Grinches threatening to steal Christmas this year and they don’t care whether you’ve been naughty or nice.

Robbers some of them armed have attacked delivery trucks threatened drivers and stolen merchandise in several U.S. cities in the past few weeks adding a new woe to retailers’ growing lists of concerns as the holiday shopping season officially kicked off last week with Black Friday sales.

Big store chains are already battered by losses from rising store thefts by organized crime rings that have prompted store closings in many cities and nervous about the spending power of inflation-scarred recession-wary consumers. These delivery-truck attacks are more than bad PR. They have exposed new vulnerability to all-important online sales which depend on reliable delivery services.

The industry can ill afford this lump of coal in its stocking. A new survey from the National Retail Federation (NRF) showed losses from theft – called shrink – rose to US$112.1-billion in 2022 from US$93.9-billion the previous year. Further 67 per cent of respondents said they see more violence and aggression related to organized retail crime.

For consumers it doesn’t matter whether or not there are similar attacks in their neighbourhoods or communities. They will pay for them one way or another. The costs of losses from stolen goods will be passed along in the form of higher prices and fees for online goods.

The rising costs of security measures will drive up prices too and qualified labour – already in short supply – will cost more to hire retain and protect. The ripple effect will be felt all the way down the value chain.

This new breed of sociopath behind the truck attacks goes beyond so-called porch pirates the cowardly losers who troll neighbourhoods stealing boxes from front stoops when no one is looking. Truck-jackers are bold brazen and often armed.

In a recent daylight robbery in Atlanta a group of bandits ransacked an Amazon Prime truck while the driver was making a delivery and fled with armloads of packages. In Maryland an armed robber hijacked a UPS delivery truck. In Sanford Fla. a man jumped on an Amazon delivery truck and threatened the driver.

And in the most dramatic incident motorists in Memphis Tenn. used their cars to ambush and corner a huge FedEx tractor-trailer then dozens of people some armed rushed the truck broke open the trailer’s locked rear doors and stole as many packages as they could carry.

Violence toward delivery drivers has risen as consumers have embraced online shopping. Delivery driving is among the deadliest occupations in the country according to occupational fatalities and injury data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. While most deaths and injuries are from traffic accidents the data also show drivers are more at risk of assaults than other occupations.

The trend is another blow to a retail sector that has struggled in many cities to make stores safer and more secure while keeping the customer experience civil if not pleasant. For some that has meant putting more merchandise in locked cabinets installing high-tech surveillance systems and hiring guards.

Target chief executive Brian Cornell told investors on the company’s second-quarter earnings call that stores saw a 120-per-cent increase in incidents of violence or threats of violence in the first five months of the year.

In a statement accompanying its survey the NRF said: “Far beyond the financial impact of these crimes the violence and concerns over safety continue to be the priority for all retailers regardless of size or category.”

True enough. But make no mistake the financial impact will be real and customers will pay for it regardless of where they live and shop."

If negotiations this month don’t find agreement that has been elusive so far Louisville-based Baptist Health will no longer be in the Medicare Advantage networks of UnitedHealthcare and WellCare. It has been out of network with Louisville-based Humana for two months.

“In-network rates for medical care are generally more affordable than out-of-network rates” explains Morgan Watkins of Louisville Public Media. Patients pay less out of pocket for services from an in-network provider.

Baptist Health “has cited concerns about various Medicare Advantage plans routinely denying or delaying approvals of or payments for medical services recommended by patients’ doctors” Watkins reports. “The health system said it has been trying to negotiate new contracts with several insurers.”

When that didn’t work with Humana Baptist Health and its clinicians left the insurer’s network in September. Starting Jan. 1 it will no longer be in the UnitedHealthcare and WellCare networks unless negotiations forge an agreement. Baptist has alerted its patients.

Baptist spokesperson Kit Fullenlove Barry told Watkins “It remains our top priority to secure agreements with Medicare Advantage plans that protect our patients’ access to the medical care they need and allow medical care decisions to be made by the patient and their doctor not an insurance company.”

UnitedHealthcare the nation’s largest health insurer told Watkins it still hopes to reach an agreement with Baptist Kentucky’s largest hosptal chain: “Our top priority is to renew our relationship with Baptist Health and ensure continued access to the health system for people enrolled in our Medicare Advantage plans. We are committed to continued good-faith negotiation and using the remaining time on our contract to reach a new agreement.” Wellcare did not comment.

A person with an HMO plan could face “significantly higher” out-of-pocket costs starting next year Baptist said in a letter to patients. But if a patient applies for “continuity of care” benefits for patients who are pregnant or receiving chemotherapy or dialysis the Medicare Advantage plan would have to temporarily cover their care at Baptist with in-network rates.

Advantage plans have lower costs but with limits on befefits and providers. Original Medicare has no such limits. Also Watkins notes “A 2022 federal inspector general report said audits “have highlighted widespread and persistent problems related to inappropriate denials of services and payment” by Advantage plans.

Open enrollment for Medicare Advantage plans runs through Thursday Dec. 7. It will resume Jan. 1 and end March 31; for switching Advantage plans or going to original Medicare.

Help with Medicare is available at Medicare.gov 1-800-MEDICARE and the Kentucky State Health Insurance Plan office.

Dividend stocks are a great way to earn extra income but owning dividend stocks requires regular research. Shareholders risk losing money if they fail to familiarize themselves with the underlying companies. Hefty payouts can mean very little if the stock itself depreciates substantially.

Income investors can sidestep that risk with index funds particularly those that are diversified across a broad range of dividend stocks. Shareholders still need to understand any index funds they own but that requires much less work than keeping tabs on multiple companies.

Here are two dividend-paying index funds that have reliably made money for patient investors.

1. Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF

The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM 0.08%) tracks 452 large publicly traded U.S. companies that are forecast to have above-average dividend yields. It includes value stocks from 10 of the 11 market sectors (every sector except real estate) but its weighted exposure skews toward financials healthcare and consumer staples.

The current dividend yield is 3.4% and the last dividend payment was $0.78 per share in September. History says the next dividend payment will take place in December. The five largest holdings in the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF are detailed below:

ExxonMobil: 3.6% JPMorgan Chase: 3.2% Johnson & Johnson: 2.9% Procter & Gamble: 2.6% Broadcom: 2.6%

The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF returned 134% over the past decade or 8.9% annually. That falls far short of the 204% return in the broader S&P 500. The reason for that underperformance is relatively low exposure to the technology sector which was easily the best-performing sector over the past decade.

The compensation for that underperformance is above-average dividend payments and below-average volatility. As noted the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF currently pays a 3.4% yield. That easily tops the 1.62% yield paid by the broader S&P 500. The index fund also bears a 10-year beta of 0.86 meaning it moved 86 basis points for every 100-basis-point movement in the S&P 500.

The last important number is the 0.06% expense ratio. That is well below average and it means investors would pay just $6 per year on a $10000 portfolio. All things considered the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF is a good option for investors who would gladly exchange market-beating returns for robust and reliable dividend payments.

2. Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF

The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG -0.05%) tracks 314 large U.S. companies that have consistently increased their dividend payments over the last decade. It includes growth stocks and value stocks from 10 of the 11 market sectors (real estate is excluded) but its weighted exposure skews most heavily toward technology financials and healthcare.

The dividend yield is currently 1.97% and the last dividend payment was $0.77 per share in early October. History says the next dividend payment will take place in early January. The five largest positions in the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF are detailed below:

Microsoft: 5.3% Apple: 4.4% UnitedHealth Group: 3.5% ExxonMobil: 3.1% JPMorgan Chase: 2.9%

The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF returned 168% over the last decade or 10.4% annually. That falls short of the 204% return in the S&P 500 but tops the 134% return in the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF. That in-the-middle performance is a product of its in-the-middle exposure to the technology sector.

Here again the compensation for underperformance is above-average dividend payments and below-average volatility. The yield currently sits at 1.97% modestly higher than the 1.62% yield paid by the broader the S&P 500. The index fund also bears a 10-year beta of 0.87 meaning it moved 87 basis points for every 100-basis-point movement in the S&P 500.

The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF has a below-average expense ratio of 0.06%. This index fund is a great option for investors who want reliable and above-average dividend payments but also bigger returns than the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF is likely to provide.

Index funds can supplement a portfolio of individual stocks

The index funds discussed above are a great way to spread money across hundreds of dividend-paying companies but investors do not need to choose between index funds and individual stocks.

Personally I have most of my portfolio invested in growth stocks many of which fall into the technology sector. But I also own a few index funds that improve my exposure to market sectors and companies that I follow less closely.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYWh0dHBzOi8va3NsdHYuY29tLzYwNTQ3MC9vbmUtZGVhZC10d28taW5qdXJlZC1pbi1wYXJpcy1rbmlmZS1hbmQtaGFtbWVyLWF0dGFjay1uZWFyLWVpZmZlbC10b3dlci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,One dead two injured in Paris knife and hammer attack near Eiffel Tower,"(CNN) — French police have arrested a man suspected of killing one person and injuring two others in a knife and hammer attack in central Paris.

The attack took place at Bir Hakeim near the Eiffel Tower France’s Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin told reporters at the scene on Saturday night.

He said that the man arrested was a French citizen previously known to intelligence services.

One man – a German tourist born in the Philippines – was killed in the attack and two others sustained non-life threatening injuries he added.

One of the police officers responding to the scene used a taser to neutralize the attacker Darmanin said. The suspect’s life is not at risk he added.

“After his arrest he said he could no longer bear to see Muslims dying in both Afghanistan and Palestine” Darmanin said.

Suspect was known to intelligence services

Addressing reporters Darmanin said that the suspect was born in France in 1997 and had been sentenced to four years in prison back in 2016 for planning “violent action.”

The suspect was known to intelligence services for having “serious psychiatric disorders” Darmanin added.

The minister said he had been told by police that the attacker had reportedly shouted “Allahu Akbar” during the assault.

French President Emmanuel Macron called the incident a terror attack and said France’s anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office would investigate.

“I send all my condolences to the family and loved ones of the German national who died this evening” Macron wrote in a post on X in the early hours of Sunday.

He also thanked the French emergency services.

“The national anti-terrorism prosecutor’s office now will be responsible for shedding light on this matter so that justice can be done in the name of the French people” Macron wrote.

Videos taken at the scene showed police cars ambulances and the Paris Fire Brigade arriving with heavy traffic being diverted away. Numerous cordons were also set up.

Members of the public have been advised to avoid the area."

Working closely with stakeholders including the district medical officers community leaders and health promotion outlets the health services provided included cervical cancer screening for women medical services optometry services and pediatric services. The service reached over 300 people within 3 days in the Mkuranga Hospital.

Speaking at the screening exercise Dr Iriya Nemes Joseph Programme Officer at WHO noted the unwavering commitment and support of WHO in supporting the Government in achieving the universal health coverage agenda.

“The health outreach programme comes at an opportune time and aligns significantly with WHO’s call for health for all” noted Dr Iriya. “This partnership will help to address diseases to ultimately contribute to saving lives and livelihoods.”

This health outreach programme forms part of an overall vision of ensuring universal health coverage for all in Tanzania. This constitutes people having access to the full range of quality health services they need when and where they need them without financial hardship

On his part Dr Daedong Kim Team lead from KOICA expressed the pleasure of KOICA to partner with WHO and acknowledged the efforts of partners and Korean volunteers in supporting Tanzania’s public health priority.

“This initiative will strengthen healthcare systems and empower the local communities” he stated. “We are indeed happy to be serving the people of Tanzania and KOICA is committed to the health agenda on the country”.

This intervention works across all levels of the health system from community health at the household level to tertiary care at the regional hospital. At the level of the PHCs in addition to the removal of user fees the intervention includes a range of activities to increase PHC readiness (e.g. infrastructure equipment supplies and personnel) support clinical programs (e.g. maternal and child health infectious diseases) and improve data systems. As of January 2023 a minimum package of support has been provided to all 15 PHC2s of all 15 communes and will be expanded to a complete package at all levels of PHCs by the end of 2024. Because the progress of these health system strengthening interventions in Ifanadiana and elsewhere typically differ across PHCs and time this requires an adjustment method that considers spatio-temporal differences in healthcare policies and interventions such as the ZERO-G estimator.

As is common in sub-Saharan Africa23 the primary barriers to healthcare at PHCs in Ifanadiana are geographical and financial. The majority of the district is rural and the transportation network is primarily non-motorized; over 70% of the population lives further than an hour travel time from a PHC24. As such geographical access to care at PHCs is highly unequal and exhibits strong distance-decay from PHC locations11. Regarding financial barriers 34% of the public health expenditure in Madagascar is out-of-pocket spending25 with user fees the most cited barrier to healthcare seeking across the district26. Given these known barriers we aimed to reduce the impact of geographic and financial bias in malaria incidence rates by adjusting the data using ZERO-G.

Data collection

Monthly consultation data were collected at each PHC for the district of Ifanadiana from January 2016 to December 2021. Photos were taken of handwritten registries at each PHC and patients’ residences were manually geolocated to the precision of the fokontany. The number of all-cause consultations were reported by fokontany as well as the number of malaria cases as confirmed by rapid detection test (RDT). Because patient ages were provided in these registries we were able to divide the number of consultations and malaria cases into three age groups for analysis: children under 5 years old juveniles aged 5–14 and adults aged 15 and over. Ifanadiana suffers from shortages of diagnostic materials specifically RDTs27 leading to unconfirmed cases of malaria. We accounted for this reduced diagnostic capacity by scaling the confirmed malaria cases by the proportion of feverish patients who were tested via an RDT at each PHC during each month (n = 536). Information on the characteristics of each clinic by month was provided by Pivot’s Monitoring and Evaluation for Research and Learning team.

Population data came from two sources. For the 80 fokontany that receive community health program support from Pivot we used population estimates from a Pivot-led census conducted in 2021. For the remaining 115 fokontany population estimates came from a national census conducted in 2018 by the Madagascar National Institute of Statistics. By interpolating population values between the 2018 census and the previous 1993 census we estimated an average annual population growth rate of 2.0%. We applied this population growth rate to both datasets to obtain each fokontany’s population by year. For both datasets we assumed 18% of the population to be under 5 years old 28.6% of the population to be aged 5–14 and the remainder to be 15 years old or above based on the average age structure of the 80 fokontany that were censused in 2021.

Distances between residential areas and PHCs were calculated on a high-resolution transport network created via crowd-sourced mapping through a collaboration with Humanitarian OpenStreetMap. Over 20000 km of footpaths and 100000 buildings within the district were mapped through a two-step validation process24 resulting in an open-source dataset on OpenStreetMap. Using this dataset we estimated the distance between each household and each PHC within the district and aggregated this to the scale of the fokontany to result in an average distance to each PHC for each fokontany. Three fokontany lacked accurate routing information and so were excluded from the analysis.

We evaluated our estimates of the \(SI\) and adjusted malaria incidence rates using external data from a longitudinal cohort survey conducted in the district of Ifanadiana (IHOPE cohort). The IHOPE cohort has conducted population-representative surveys approximately every two years from 2014 to 2021 using a two-stage cluster sampling scheme involving 80 spatial clusters each containing 20 households28. We include data from 2016 2018 and 2021 in this analysis. The IHOPE cohort is based on the internationally validated Demographic and Health Surveys and is implemented by the Madagascar National Institute of Statistics. See Miller et al.28 for further details on participant recruitment and study design. As part of the survey questionnaire participants were asked if they were ill in the past four weeks and if so if they sought care at a public PHC. This data represented self-reported healthcare seeking behavior comparable to ZERO-G estimates of sampling intensity. Malaria prevalence data was collected via RDTs conducted as part of the IHOPE survey in 2021. Briefly children under 15 years old who consented to the study were tested for active malaria infection using SD One Step Malaria HRP-II(P.f) and pLDH(Pan) Antigen Rapid Tests. Those who tested positive were provided with a standard treatment of artesunate amodiaquine and paracetamol with duration and dosage in accordance with national guidelines. In total this resulted in 3774 samples across 80 clusters and 109 fokontany.

Applying the ZERO-G estimator

Estimating healthcare access ( \({\varvec{A}}\) )

We estimated the healthcare access for each fokontany and month combination in our dataset following the methods described above for each age class (children juveniles and adults) using non-malarial consultations at PHCs. We included five traits of the health center in our calculation of \({S}_{j}\):

1. Whether the PHC fell within the initial Pivot service catchment 2. If point-of-care user fees (consultation costs and medications) had been removed at that time 3. The number of staff at the PHC during each month 4. Level of health clinic (PHC1 or PHC2 with PHC2 providing more services) 5. Distance from the PHC to the District office which provides supplies medications and supervision.

In addition two new PHC2 were opened in the district during the study period one in Ampasinambo in November 2016 and one in Ambiabe in April 2018 which we accounted for in our calculation of \(SI\). Notably ZERO-G allows for health center traits that change over time which we used to include monthly staffing changes the construction of new health centers and user fee removal interventions that were implemented over the study period.

To reduce computational time we set a maximum limit on the distance between a community and the PHC (\({d}_{ij}\)) at 25 km slightly above the maximum distance of a fokontany to the nearest PHC in Ifanadiana (22.1 km). We also included an additional parameter in our estimation of \(f\left({d}_{ij}\right)\) to allow the shape of this relationship to differ for those fokontany within the Pivot zone of intervention and those outside the zone of intervention following Garchitorena et al.11.

We estimated the number of non-malarial consultations \({h}_{it}\) as a random variable with a binomial distribution with the probability equal to the healthcare access (\({A}_{it}\)) and size \({n}_{it}\) equal to the population size of the fokontany (Eq. 2). Some fokontany had extremely low consultation rates and reported zero consultations for over 50% of the study period. We excluded these fokontany (n = 43) from the model fitting exercise estimating the parameters for \({A}_{it}\) but did estimate their healthcare access from the fit model. To ensure our estimate represented the global maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) and not a local maximum we used a two-step MLE estimation process. First we performed a grid search via a latin hypercube sample of 1000 samples of coarse parameter space to identify the ten parameter sets with the lowest negative log-likelihood. We then performed a second MLE step using the BFGS algorithm via the optim function in the stats package in R29 using the parameter sets identified in the first step as the starting parameters. We assessed each of these ten iterations for convergence and selected the parameter set with the lowest negative log-likelihood as the optimal fit. A total of 11 parameters were estimated for each age class (Table S2.1). From the optimal parameter sets we estimated \({A}_{it}\) for each fokontany-month combination for each age-class via Eq. (3).

Imputing erroneous zeroes

Nearly all fokontany (n = 189) reported zero malaria cases across all ages at least once during the study period totaling 3468 (28.4%) of fokontany-month samples. On average fokontany reported zero malaria cases for 18.1 months out of the 66 month period with a range of 0–53 months reporting zeros. The ZERO-G method imputed between 6.08 and 10.00% of fokontany-month incidence values for each age class an average of 4.75 months per fokontany (range: 0–22).

Rescaling healthcare access to sampling intensity

We manually set the sampling intensity (\(SI\)) to 1 for those fokontany which had an average annual healthcare utilization rate over 1 consultation per capita-year defined as “high access fokontany” (n = 19). The remaining fokontany’s healthcare access values were rescaled following Eqs. (11) (12) using multi-objective optimization to calculate their monthly \(SI\) values.

Evaluating adjusted datasets

We evaluated our estimates of \(SI\) and adjusted malaria incidence rates using external data from the IHOPE cohort. Self-reported healthcare seeking behavior was paired spatially to \(SI\) estimates by assigning a value to a fokontany if a village from the cluster was in that fokontany. The data were paired temporally by taking the average of the \(SI\) during the 6 month period containing the months when the IHOPE survey was conducted in each year (January through June for 2016 and 2021 and July through December for 2018) to reduce the impact of month outliers in healthcare utilization data on \(SI\) estimates. We assessed the agreement between the two datasets by calculating the correlation between estimated \(SI\) and the proportion of residents reporting illness who attended PHCs using Clifford’s modified t-test which controls for spatial autocorrelation30. We assessed the correlation separately for each year (2016 2018 2021) including 109 fokontany per year.

We evaluated the ability of ZERO-G adjusted incidence rates to accurately represent malaria burdens by comparing adjusted incidence rates to malaria prevalence data collected via the IHOPE cohort in 2021. The two datasets were paired spatially by assigning a value to a fokontany if a village from the cluster was in that fokontany and were paired overtime by matching the month of the IHOPE survey to the month of the incidence rates. Because the relationship between prevalence and incidence is non-linear we transformed cluster-level prevalence rates into incidence rates following a previously published model31 to allow us to compare incidence rates from both datasets. However there remain important differences between this measure of incidence and that derived from case notifications. Prevalence data may under-estimate malaria incidence as the conversion results only in symptomatic cases of malaria while case notifications may include a higher proportion of asymptomatic cases due to co-infection with a second febrile-inducing pathogen32. We compared adjusted incidence rates for children under 15 years old to prevalence rates of children under 15 years old from the IHOPE cohort for all fokontany with information in both datasets (n = 109) via Clifford’s modified t-test. We also assessed the ability of the adjusted incidence data to correctly identify hot spots of malaria defined as the quartile of fokontany with the highest prevalence-derived incidence rates.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vZGVybmhlYWx0aGNhcmUuY29tL3Blb3BsZS9tb2Rlcm4taGVhbHRoY2FyZS1tb3N0LWluZmx1ZW50aWFsLTIwMDEtMjAyM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Modern Healthcare's Most Influential from 2001-2023,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.modernhealthcare.com/people/modern-healthcare-most-influential-2001-2023 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vZGVybmhlYWx0aGNhcmUuY29tL3Blb3BsZS9tb2Rlcm4taGVhbHRoY2FyZS1tb3N0LWluZmx1ZW50aWFsLTIwMDEtMjAyM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDMzOTgzMy1kZXNhbnRpcy1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1wbGFuLXN1cGVyc2VkZS1vYmFtYWNhcmUv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80MzM5ODMzLWRlc2FudGlzLWhlYWx0aC1jYXJlLXBsYW4tc3VwZXJzZWRlLW9iYW1hY2FyZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DeSantis says his health care plan would ‘supersede’ ObamaCare,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4339833-desantis-health-care-plan-supersede-obamacare/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vdGhlaGlsbC5jb20vaG9tZW5ld3MvY2FtcGFpZ24vNDMzOTgzMy1kZXNhbnRpcy1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1wbGFuLXN1cGVyc2VkZS1vYmFtYWNhcmUv0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly90aGVoaWxsLmNvbS9ob21lbmV3cy9jYW1wYWlnbi80MzM5ODMzLWRlc2FudGlzLWhlYWx0aC1jYXJlLXBsYW4tc3VwZXJzZWRlLW9iYW1hY2FyZS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTWh0dHBzOi8vYm1jcHVibGljaGVhbHRoLmJpb21lZGNlbnRyYWwuY29tL2FydGljbGVzLzEwLjExODYvczEyODg5LTAyMy0xNzA3OC010gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Determinants of catastrophic costs among households affected by multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in Ho Chi Minh City ...,"This study showed that catastrophic costs are common among people with MDR-TB and their households and that the main contributors are income loss and direct non-medical costs. Direct non-medical costs were highest during the intensive treatment phase predominantly due to nutritional supplements food and travel yet vouchers to cover these costs were more commonly reported as being received towards the end of the treatment. People with MDR-TB who experienced catastrophic costs faced a greater decline of household income during MDR-TB treatment than those who did not experience catastrophic costs and throughout the duration of their treatment income did not return to pre-TB levels. Job loss at the beginning of the treatment lower educational level and being the primary income earner of the household were identified as risk factors for catastrophic costs incurrence.

The proportion of people experiencing catastrophic costs among MDR-TB-affected households in HCMC Viet Nam (87% [95% CI: 79–93) is similar to estimates from other lower middle-income countries in Southeast Asia [13 17 40] and to the global average proportion of DR-TB-affected households experiencing catastrophic costs (87% [95% CI: 80–93%]) [3]. Compared to national estimates for Viet Nam in 2016 the catastrophic costs prevalence of our study is lower (98% vs. 87%) and instead of direct non-medical costs in 2016 income loss was identified as the main cost contributor (32% vs. 80% household income loss 46% vs. 17% direct non-medical cost) [12]. These differences may potentially be accounted for due to methodological and geographical differences between our subnational study and the 2016 national PCS. The national PCS took a cross-sectional rather than longitudinal approach to estimate catastrophic costs featured study participants on a 20-month rather than a 9-month regimen and recruited nationally in predominantly secondary cities and rural areas. Our study was longitudinal focused on people with MDR-TB being treated with shorter regimens and only recruited in HCMC which has relatively high monthly average income per capita population growth rate and living costs [21].

In our study direct medical costs contributed the smallest share of the total costs during MDR-TB treatment. However before MDR-TB treatment medical costs were around four-times higher than non-medical costs. Similar observations have been made in Myanmar [41] Lao People’s Democratic Republic [13] and the Philippines [15] although the nominal amount of medical costs during MDR-TB treatment were higher in those countries compared to our results. A possible explanation is that following treatment initiation medical costs are minimized due to free TB tests services implemented as part of the NTP and fewer hospitalisations. Viet Nam has a remarkably high Universal Health Coverage (UHC) service coverage index among lower-middle-income countries [3]. However Viet Nam has one of the highest rates of catastrophic costs incurrence among people with TB in the world [3]. Thus in Viet Nam efforts are needed to mitigate especially direct non-medical costs and income loss not included in SHI coverage.

People not covered by SHI need to be supported with additional social protection programmes. Results from the first national TB PCS have triggered a series of changes in policy action and practice showing the government’s commitment and efforts to reduce catastrophic costs such as the development of packages for ambulatory TB services advocating for SHI coverage or the creation of national policy guide on interventions to reduce treatment costs [42]. Our results emphasize the need to further support people with MDR-TB by addressing specific social protection elements that are involved in higher treatment costs compared to DS-TB.

This could potentially be achieved using an approach that incorporated three dimensions. Firstly by increasing monetary transfers and travel or food support. Secondly by building a more people-centred decentralised delivery system for TB care services that minimizes hospitalisation and time lost due to care seeking. Thirdly by expanding linkage to other TB-related services such as quality assured MDR-TB diagnosis and treatment services [43]. The latter includes the provision and prioritization of the less costly shorter treatment regimen as recommended by the WHO over the 20-month regimen [10 11]. Social protection mechanisms to cover income loss and direct non-medical costs have the potential to reduce catastrophic costs prevalence as shown in India and South Africa [44 45] as well as various European countries [46]. Implementing social protection mechanisms that are complementary to efforts towards UHC in Viet Nam could act synergistically to eliminate catastrophic costs.

Although the majority of participants (93%) in this study received some form of social support during their treatment this support had a weak effect in lowering catastrophic costs. Several factors and misconceptions might have prevented greater reduction of catastrophic costs despite the presence of social support. Participants may be hesitant in using free services potentially due to doubts about their quality of care compared to paid services [47]. Furthermore the time at which the affected person received the social support might also influence the protective effect. For example total costs and in particular non-medical costs seem to be highest at the beginning of the treatment. Therefore even if social support such as vouchers were received later during the treatment it would not cover earlier financial shock. Addressing misconceptions around quality of subsidized services and the provision of timely support for MDR-TB affected households are needed to improve social protection mechanisms.

On the other hand catastrophic costs as a binary indicator only provides information on whether the TB affected households experienced financial shock due to their treatment and if they are at risk of adverse TB outcome [4]. It does not represent impoverishment and the size of the poverty gap created due to the treatment for which a more in-depth analysis would be necessary. Thus by focusing merely on the catastrophic costs indicator as outcome may lead to an underestimation of positive effects created by existing social protection mechanisms in preventing impoverishment covering costs for TB services or improving productivity and the household’s capacity to pay.

People experiencing catastrophic costs in this study had to deal with a strong decline in household income with weak signs of recovery towards the end of the treatment yet without reaching pre-TB household income levels. In contrast a study in HCMC with similar longitudinal adaption of the PCS found a near-full recovery during the continuation phase among people with DS-TB and a comparatively lower income loss during the treatment compared to our study [31]. This suggests that people with MDR-TB experience a greater financial shock during the treatment from which they recover more slowly compared to DS-TB. About half of our study population were affected by a previous episode of TB or had another household member affected by TB. Missing recovery from financial hardships experienced during previous TB episodes may have contributed to a greater income loss. Consequently MDR-TB affected households may require greater efforts to compensate for the income lost for example by returning to coping strategies such as taking loans or selling assets. The recovery from income loss may also depend on additional activities from household members or the ability of the MDR-TB affected person to keep or regain their employment status from before the treatment. To support this process sickness insurance disability grants and job protection could be provided or their coverage expanded to people and households with MDR-TB.

The risk factors identified in this study were similar to risk factors reported in other research studies [13 14 17 48]. Apart from job protection and financial support educational support interventions and integration into existing social support mechanisms could be provided for people at risk so that they are enabled to seek and continue care as well as to make informed choices about their own health [49].

Furthermore all the participants who self-reported experiencing stigma also experienced catastrophic costs. Thus further research with increased sample size is needed to study a potential association between stigma among people with MDR-TB and their experience of catastrophic costs within the country setting. In Viet Nam stigma and self-isolation among people with DR-TB are connected and shaped by cultural expectations [50]. Consequences include reduced psychological and social wellbeing which may affect the working and productivity state of the affected person and household treatment adherence with the risk of MDR-TB transmission and adverse treatment outcome [37]. Social protection packages and the NTP might want to consider psychosocial support and counselling services within the cultural context and understanding of MDR-TB as also suggested by Smith et al. [51].

Other risk factors supported by literature yet not found to be associated with catastrophic costs incurrence in our study were previous TB episodes hospitalisation BMI and treatment delay [4 14 17 52]. Moreover there was a lack of evidence in the literature regarding the impact of coping strategies and social support as potential predictors of experiencing catastrophic costs. The use of coping strategies and the receipt of social support seem to be more frequent among people experiencing catastrophic costs in this study yet due to a small sample size and the lack of statistical evidence these study variables were excluded in the final model. Besides sample size limitations deviations from literature findings could also be explained by different study populations. Whereas other studies usually pool together people with DS-TB and MDR-TB before analysing associations with catastrophic costs [4 14 40] our study population was explicitly addressing people with MDR-TB only. People with MDR-TB could acquire resistance from a previous TB episode [39]. In this case the person was already exposed to TB care facilities treatment procedures and support services which may have facilitated the process of seeking and receiving care or social support thus for example lowering the risk of catastrophic costs due to hospitalisations.

Study limitations

This study has various limitations. Due to the small sample size low frequency of observations within the group of people not experiencing catastrophic costs caused numerical issues during logistic regression analyses and hence wide confidence intervals of odds ratios [53]. Future studies may need to consider increasing the sample size or pooling data of low frequency observations to explore their association with catastrophic costs in the Vietnamese setting with greater confidence and to examine the potential role of social protection in this vulnerable group.

Secondly we used the output approach for the analysis of risk factors which may be error-prone in settings without a large formal employment sector due to the unreliability of self-reported income [35]. As a considerable proportion (45%) of our study population belonged to the informal sector we need to be aware of potential social desirability bias in self-reporting of income during the interview. To a certain extent the longitudinal design controls for recall bias within each treatment phase while the risk of under- or overestimation of income remains.

Thirdly the output approach does not distinguish between household income loss due to reasons unrelated to TB care-seeking. HCMC experienced several partial and complete lockdowns due to COVID-19 during the study and participants’ treatment period [33]. As a consequence household income across the entire welfare distribution declined which might affected the households’ capacity to recover from financial shock. Farmers for example needed to drastically lower selling prices of their products. Additional trading restrictions and prise increase of consumables indicate decreasing income and increasing costs due to the pandemic [7]. Moreover a greater gender gap in unemployment for females was created [54]. Thus this study potentially underestimates the impact of risk factors associated with experiencing catastrophic costs during the pandemic among females. In this context the outbreak has introduced additional unmeasured or unexplored associations that could have potentially confounded the income loss due to TB treatment.

Fourthly we excluded 24 participants from the final analysis due to loss of follow up or other reasons which may have introduced a bias as the participants excluded were significantly older and had a lower wealth status.

Generalizability and transferability

This study is restricted to a specific group of people receiving MDR-TB treatment with a nine-month regimen living in HCMC which is the largest city in Viet Nam with an average monthly income per capita above the country average and which at this time was severely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. The difference is reflected when comparing the average monthly household income before treatment of this study cohort to national estimates (US$ 807 vs. 368) [12]. With higher hourly wage income from labour activities increased which affected the household’s capacity to pay. As this analysis focused on people within the nine-months regimen it is not generalizable to people who received MDR-TB treatment to alternative regimens such as the 20-months regimens. People who received a 20-months regimen suffer from over 40% higher total treatment costs compared to those in the nine-months regimen [11]. Furthermore of the 172 eligible people only 94 were included in this analysis; thus the cohort may not represent the majority of people living in HCMC and receiving the nine-months regimen.

The study also does not cover the population groups outside of or in rural Viet Nam such as ethnic minorities in mountainous regions. Those areas may be exposed to greater access barriers when seeking care at health facilities and restricted in the efficiency of service delivery due to limited resources and health workforce. Consequently catastrophic costs among the population group in those areas could be expected to be higher due to greater time and productivity loss. Although common risk factors have been found in different country contexts the results are specific to the Vietnamese healthcare and delivery system.

All study participants were enrolled in the NTP which offers a standardized package of treatment and care services. People with MDR-TB who are not enrolled in the NTP may not have access to the same service levels which could result in prolonged treatment greater costs and additional risk factors to experience catastrophic costs."

It operates through the following segments: midstream chemicals refining and marketing and specialties. The midstream segment provides crude oil and refined petroleum product transportation and processing services as well as natural gas and natural gas liquids transportation storage fractionation gathering processing and marketing services. The chemicals segment consists of Phillips 66's 50% equity investment in Chevron Phillips Chemical (CPChem) which manufactures and markets petrochemicals and plastics on a worldwide basis. The refining business refines crude oil and other feedstocks into petroleum products such as gasoline distillates and aviation fuels as well as renewable fuels at 12 refineries in the U.S. and Europe. The marketing and specialties segment purchases for resale and markets refined petroleum products and renewable fuels.

Percentage Ownership: n/a Average Cost: n/a Activist Commentary: Elliott is a very successful and astute activist investor. The firm's team includes analysts from leading tech private equity firms engineers operating partners – former technology CEOs and COOs. When evaluating an investment the firm also hires specialty and general management consultants expert cost analysts and industry specialists. The firm often watches companies for many years before investing and has an extensive stable of impressive board candidates. Elliott has historically focused on strategic activism in the technology sector and has been very successful with that strategy. However over the past several years its activism group has grown and evolved and the firm has been doing a lot more longer-term activism and creating value from a board level at a much larger breadth of companies. The firm's activism has always been well thought out and the detailed analysis it presented here is evidence of that.

On Wednesday Elliott sent a letter to Phillips 66 announcing that it has taken a $1 billion stake and is seeking up to two board seats.

Activist investors like to claim that they are ""amicable"" or ""constructive."" While we do not generalize like that it is hard to imagine a more amicable and constructive activist campaign than what Elliott is proposing at Phillips 66.

Phillips 66 has underperformed peers Valero Energy and Marathon Petroleum by 45% and 191% respectively over the past three years and by 163% and 248% respectively over the past 10 years. Elliott thinks this can largely be attributed to the company's shift in focus away from the refining segment and management's poor execution in cost reductions which has led to a loss of investor confidence.

Since his elevation to CEO in July 2022 Mark Lashier has committed to a strategic outlook that includes refocusing on the refining segment cutting costs targeting $14 billion of mid-cycle earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization by 2025 selling $3 billion of non-core assets and increasing the company's long-term capital return policy. Elliott wholeheartedly agrees with this plan and thinks it could lead to a $205 stock price. The first part of an activist campaign convincing management that your plan is better than theirs is already done here. The only thing activists like more than a management team agreeing with the activist's plan is a management team that has its own plan that the activist agrees with.

But communicating a plan to the market is one thing getting investors to believe that you can execute is entirely another. There has been a lack of shareholder trust here much of which stems from the company's AdvantEdge66 program in 2019 aimed at reducing costs. When implemented Phillips 66 saw costs increase relative to peers burning shareholders' confidence in the management team's ability to achieve its goals. The first step in rebuilding management credibility would be adding new directors to the board particularly at the request of a shareholder. If those directors happened to have refining operations experience that would give investors even more confidence that management is shifting their focus back to the refining business.

Elliott has significant experience in partnering with industry experts and has already identified candidates here with relevant expertise to fill two board seats. Elliott is not asking for a board seat for itself to debate with management. The firm is asking for two seats for two industry executives who would put management in the best position to execute on their plan. The best activists use board seats to support management in executing their plan but they also will hold management accountable if they are unable to do so.

That is where Elliott's plan B comes into play. If Phillips 66 adds two new directors approved by Elliott and still cannot deliver on performance targets over the next year then it will need to take a path like the one Marathon Petroleum took in its transformation. This will include making appropriate management changes closing the current $2 to $3 per barrel refining EBITDA gap between Phillips 66 and Valero and generating $15 billion to $20 billion from the sale of non-core assets including their CPChem stake European convenience stores and a portion of non-operated midstream stakes.

This should be an easy decision for the company and we would expect it to quickly appoint two new directors identified by Elliott to the board. Given the tone and substance of Elliott's outreach it would be very surprising and disappointing to see this go to a proxy fight. However if it did we believe Elliott would be a lock to get at least two board seats on the 13-person board particularly with the use of a universal proxy card.

Text description provided by the architects. Montes Claros is a city located in the northern region of Minas Gerais with intense economic activity and service offerings constituting a regional center. Located on a more or less flat area 700m above sea level the city is surrounded by a mountain range that rises to an altitude of 1000m. This geographical condition establishes a horizon contained by hills with soft contours which in some way refer to the name of the city itself.

The lot has a slight slope towards a nearby stream recently channelized and urbanized with marginal avenues. This difference in level allows to enjoy a privileged perspective of the surroundings from the bottom of the land. On the other hand in the northern part of the lot a small forest with fruit trees was cultivated over the years. This in turn gives continuity to a contiguous forest located on plots not yet built on contributing to the formation of a significant green area in the context of increasing urbanization.

The implementation of the house meets some intentions including seeking out the mountains that surround the city on the distant horizon as well as establishing a close relationship with the forest. In this sense on the upper floor directional visual relationships facing the outside are established while on the ground floor we sought to establish a horizontal multidirectional and involving relationship between the interior programs and the exterior. In order to reinforce this character the permanent seizure of the entire lot was encouraged based on a visual reading of the plot's boundaries. To this end care was taken to minimize the opacity of the programs distributed on the ground floor as well as to minimize the perception of the house's support points incorporating in this sense trunks of Pau Preto (Cenostigma tocantinum) in the shoring of the raised floor.

The materiality of the construction is somehow also defined around the issue of implementation. In this regard the facades made of solid ceramic bricks that cover the entire upper floor seek to continue despite their aerial condition the dirt floor of the neighboring lots the asphalt impregnated with the same earth the walls with exposed ceramic bricks and the ceramic roofs of the neighborhood houses.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vZXMud2lyZWQuY29tL2FydGljdWxvcy9sYS1hZm9ydHVuYWRhLWFsaWFuemEtZW50cmUtaWEtZ2VuZXJhdGl2YS15LWVqZWN1dGl2b3MtZGUtdmVudGFz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,La afortunada alianza entre la IA generativa y los ejecutivos de ventas,"El glamour del trabajo de ventas reside en ir de cena en cena cortejar a los clientes con ofertas creativas y cobrar grandes bonos. ¿Responder a cientos de aburridas preguntas planteadas en la solicitud de propuesta (RFP) de un posible cliente? Ese es un trabajo monótono. Afortunadamente para los trabajadores tras meses de especulaciones sobre la posibilidad de que la IA al estilo ChatGPT se haga cargo del trabajo administrativo la tarea corporativa de responder a las RFP es una de las primeras que la IA generativa está alterando.

IA que se encarga del trabajo aburrido

En abril el fabricante de software de comunicaciones Twilio presentó RFP Genie una herramienta de IA generativa que digiere una RFP busca información relevante en miles de archivos internos y utiliza GPT-4 de OpenAI para generar una respuesta adecuada. El equipo de ventas de la empresa solo tiene que copiar y pegar el texto en un documento formal y hacer algunos ajustes.

Las solicitudes de propuestas que antes ocupaban a un par de empleados durante dos semanas o más ahora se hacen en cuestión de minutos. Twilio cuyas herramientas en la nube permiten a las empresas chatear con los clientes espera poder hacer más y mejores propuestas de venta y no prevé recortes de nómina. ""Esto liberará a nuestros ingenieros de soluciones para que se centren en problemas más complejos que exigen no solo razonamiento sino contextualización humana"" expresa Jeff Lawson CEO de Twilio sobre el bot de RFP del que no se ha reportado antes.

El equipo de ventas de Lawson no es el único que está disfrutando de una repentina ganancia de tiempo libre. También se han lanzado bots de respuesta a RFP de IA generativa para los equipos de ventas de la unidad en la nube de Google para la agencia de compra de publicidad EssenceMediacom y para DataRobot una startup que desarrolla software para gestionar programas de IA. En agosto el CEO de IBM Arvind Krishna seleccionó un robot de RFP como ganador de un hackathon interno de IA llamado Watsonx Challenge superando a más de 12000 participantes. El robot utilizaba un amplio modelo de lenguaje del servicio Watsonx.ai de IBM para redactar las respuestas en una décima parte del tiempo que si se hicieran únicamente a mano y la empresa está estudiando cómo adoptar el sistema. Gigantes de la consultoría como Bain y Deloitte han lanzado a sus clientes la idea de las RFP y fabricantes de software de gestión de RFP están intentando incorporar la IA generativa.

Las RFP con preguntas tediosas en las que se pide información como el tiempo de actividad de un servicio en la nube o su compatibilidad con la autenticación multifactor son una etapa inevitable en todo tipo de procesos de venta desde negocios de software hasta focos. Los clientes reciben un libro de jerga estadísticas y promesas para justificar una eventual compra y utilizarlo en cualquier disputa futura. Pero a nadie le gusta escribir o responder a las preguntas lo que en tecnología mantiene a los mejores ingenieros lejos de proyectos más importantes. Todos los implicados bromean abiertamente (o tal vez temen en secreto) que de todos modos nadie lee las respuestas antes de pulsar el botón Comprar.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiemh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZ2xpbmVhLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEyLzAyL2R1YmFpLXNlLXJlc2lzdGUtYS1sYS1kZXNhY2VsZXJhY2lvbi1tdW5kaWFsLWRlLWxhcy12ZW50YXMtZGUtaW5tdWVibGVzLWRlLWx1am8v0gGJAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZ2xpbmVhLmNvbS8yMDIzLzEyLzAyL2R1YmFpLXNlLXJlc2lzdGUtYS1sYS1kZXNhY2VsZXJhY2lvbi1tdW5kaWFsLWRlLWxhcy12ZW50YXMtZGUtaW5tdWVibGVzLWRlLWx1am8vP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dubai se resiste a la desaceleración mundial de las ventas de inmuebles de lujo,"Dubai se resiste a la desaceleración mundial de las ventas de inmuebles de lujoObreros de la construcción en las obras de una promoción residencial junto al Canal de Agua de Dubai en Dubai Emiratos Árabes Unidos el miércoles 28 de septiembre de 2022.(Bloomberg/Christopher Pike)

Ni siquiera los más ricos son inmunes a la ralentización del mercado inmobiliario

Bloomberg — Entre julio y septiembre se vendieron 362 viviendas por más de US$10 millones en 12 mercados mundiales un 24% menos que en el mismo periodo del año anterior según la inmobiliaria Knight Frank.

En Londres se vendieron 51 de las denominadas viviendas superprime en el tercer trimestre frente a las 63 del año pasado. En Singapur se vendieron 13 viviendas de ultralujo frente a las 34 del año pasado. Nueva York también registró un descenso.

Dubai por su parte se resistió a la desaceleración con 89 ventas de más de US$10 millones de dólares un aumento respecto a las 58 del tercer trimestre de 2022. Ginebra y Hong Kong también registraron aumentos.

Dubai lidera la venta de casas por más de 10 millones de dólares(Knight Frank 2023 Global)

Sin embargo los compradores de viviendas de ultralujo no deben sentirse tan mal: El valor global de las ventas de lujo ascendió a US$31.700 millones en los últimos 12 meses por encima de los US$18.600 millones gastados en 2019 pero por debajo del máximo post-pandémico de 2021 de US$40.700 millones.

PUBLICIDAD

“Las ventas superprime han sido bastante resistentes en comparación con otros mercados residenciales” dijo Liam Bailey investigador de Knight Frank. “La recuperación de los viajes y la finalización de nuevas construcciones han ayudado a respaldar las ventas”.

Knight Frank espera que las ventas disminuyan más el año que viene a medida que se construyan menos viviendas de lujo.

Sin embargo las ventas no fueron tan positivas como se esperaban ya que SEGA ha revelado un desempeño por debajo de lo esperado en su lanzamiento.

Por medio de una reciente junta de inversionistas Haruki Satomi CEO de Sega Sammy Holdings reveló que las ventas de Sonic Superstars estuvieron por debajo de lo esperado en sus primeros días en el mercado aunque espera un aumento durante finales de este año. Esto fue lo que comentó:

“Sonic Superstars se lanzó en octubre lo cual es un comienzo ligeramente más débil de lo que habíamos anticipado. Pero en realidad cuando Sonic IP se vende más es principalmente de noviembre a diciembre y más del 90% del costo de marketing de este título se gastará en la temporada de Acción de Gracias y vacaciones a partir de noviembre. Aunque en los resultados financieros anunciados hoy pronosticamos que las ventas de este título serán ligeramente más débiles debido al estado de inicio mencionado anteriormente planeamos continuar nuestros esfuerzos de marketing para vender al mismo nivel que Sonic Frontiers”.

Cuando Satomi fue cuestionado ante las razones por las cuales Sonic Superstars no alcanzó las ventas deseadas el CEO señaló que el juego llegó en un periodo bastante competitivo para la industria. Esto fue lo que señaló:

“Creemos que el impacto de los títulos principales de otras compañías lanzados al mismo tiempo es significativo pero planeamos expandir la promoción hacia la temporada navideña especialmente en el mercado extranjero. Tanto la puntuación de Metacritic como la de los usuarios son más altas que las de Sonic Frontiers y nos gustaría seguir vendiendo con firmeza”.

Recordemos que Sonic Superstars llegó al mercado el 17 de octubre tres días antes del lanzamiento de Super Mario Bros. Wonder y Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 dos de los juegos más esperados de todo el año. De esta forma es muy probable que gran parte del público optó por alguna de estas exclusivas en lugar de la más reciente aventura del erizo azul y sus compañeros.

Sin embargo con las fiestas de finales de año así como periodos como Black Friday SEGA espera que Sonic Superstars logre recuperarse y alcanzar las ventas esperadas por parte de la compañía. Si bien es cierto que esta entrega no está al nivel de Super Mario Bros. Wonder esto no significa que no valga la pena.

Pese a un par de tropiezos en el diseño de niveles y la música Sonic Superstars vale mucho la pena. El juego debutó con una calificación del 76 en Metacritic para Xbox Series X|S 73 para PlayStation 5 y 71 para Nintendo Switch. Aunque estos números pueden sonar bajas en realidad no son tan malos y el juego aún vale mucho la pena.

Solo nos queda esperar para ver si las expectativas de SEGA se cumplen durante esta temporada. En dado caso de que este no se logre la compañía japonesa recibirá un mensaje mixto por parte de la comunidad ya que Sonic Superstars cumple con múltiples deseos por parte de los fans pero no ha vendido lo que se ha esperado.

En temas relacionados aquí puedes checar nuestra reseña de Sonic Superstars. De igual forma ya sabemos cuándo se estrenará Sonic the Hedgehog 3 en los cines.

Nota del Editor:

Sonic Superstars es bueno. Tal vez como continuación de Sonic Mania sí deja mucho que desear pero esta sigue siendo una experiencia bien construida que los fans pueden apreciar. Me gustaría que SEGA siga por este camino y logre entregarnos la experiencia que todos desean ver.

Firstly we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing and secondly an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in which is a trait of a compounding machine. However after investigating Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) we don't think it's current trends fit the mold of a multi-bagger.

What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?

If you haven't worked with ROCE before it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Verizon Communications this is the formula:

Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)

0.093 = US$31b ÷ (US$385b - US$56b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).

Thus Verizon Communications has an ROCE of 9.3%. In absolute terms that's a low return but it's much better than the Telecom industry average of 4.1%.

roce

In the above chart we have measured Verizon Communications' prior ROCE against its prior performance but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Verizon Communications here for free.

The Trend Of ROCE

In terms of Verizon Communications' historical ROCE movements the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific ROCE has fallen from 13% over the last five years. Meanwhile the business is utilizing more capital but this hasn't moved the needle much in terms of sales in the past 12 months so this could reflect longer term investments. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.

In Conclusion...

Bringing it all together while we're somewhat encouraged by Verizon Communications' reinvestment in its own business we're aware that returns are shrinking. And investors appear hesitant that the trends will pick up because the stock has fallen 14% in the last five years. All in all the inherent trends aren't typical of multi-baggers so if that's what you're after we think you might have more luck elsewhere.

Like most companies Verizon Communications does come with some risks and we've found 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.

This week Verizon’s Fios announced Fios TV+ a new Android-powered streaming player and streaming version of their TV service that will let their customers stream their cable TV package and favorite streaming services all in once place.

“Fios TV+ is a game-changer for delivering all your favorite live TV and streaming content all in one place and we’re excited to bring this experience to all of our new Fios video customers at no extra cost” said Heather McDavitt Vice President Consumer Products for Verizon. “We are committed to always innovating to bring the best industry-leading experiences our customers deserve and expect from Verizon.”

Much like Spectrum’s Xumo Player this Android-powered device will stream TV programming from Fios like it would from Netflix or Hulu.

“Fios TV+ is just the latest example of how we’re continuing to deliver the best experiences for our customers” said Tom Nugent Vice President of Consumer Sales and Service for Verizon. “With these advances in Fios technology I’m excited for all of the ways our Fios TV customers can stream their favorite TV shows and movies like never before.”

Fios TV+ is the same price as its older TV service. As far as the end users are concerned the only difference here is the device that is offering the stream. The new device can be self-installed like any Roku or Fire TV or Verizon will send someone to your house to set it up.

Fios TV+ starts at $75 a month with one set-top box rental included. Plans go up to $119 a month and there are other charges on top of that.

Verizon is also selling YouTube TV to their customers starting at $72.99 a month if you would rather pay for YouTube TV bundled with your Fios internet.

Spectrum is also pushing streaming to all its new customers through the Xumo Player. Its old set-top boxes are still offered but not promoted to new customers in the same way the new streaming-only version of their TV service is.

According to a J.D. Power report Americans experienced 11 dropped calls text or data out of every 100 times they used their phones up from nine in 2021.

This statistic affected major carriers including Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T all of which experienced worse scores in 2023 than two years previously.

Fixing the problem is both simple and complex: carriers just need to build more cell towers but to do that requires investing billions of dollars.

Cellphone users across the U.S. are experiencing frustrating reception levels as more calls dropped in 2023 than in previous years.

Your cellphone relies on several external factors to ensure your call goes through and doesn't drop or the text message you've been drafting can be sent when you've finished it.

Mobile phones depend on your network provider the phone's distance from a cell tower and the weather to function as it should.

A technology expert Peter Tran recently revealed that problems with all three factors are coming together to form the perfect storm that impacts reception.

Speaking about the reason for reduced cellphone reception Tran told CBS News: 'It is absolutely possible for a number of reasons' adding that while it is a lesser issue smoke from wildfires can absorb or reflect cell signals but more likely is the issue of the number of cell towers not meeting the demand.

Tran said cell traffic throughout the country is increasing but the number of cell towers isn't.

Trans compared the issue with traffic saying: 'Just like you have car traffic congestion that is going into one lane it is similar to that where you have over 300 million cell phones in this country coming into just a limited amount of access to the towers.'

Verizon is working to build more cell towers to meet the growing demand.

Carriers are working to build more cell towers and are also buying larger spectrums of frequencies which gives providers the ability to deliver coverage in multiple areas Time Magazine reports.

The problem is that issues are rising in areas with growing populations meaning the existing number of cell towers is no longer sufficient for that area.

Verizon did not immediately respond to Dailymail.com's request for comment.

But a spokesperson from the company told CBS News in August that they had finished major upgrades that would make a significant difference for cell phone users.

'Now we are able to take that two-lane highway and make it a 20-lane' the spokesperson said.

A report revealed which carrier offers the best network availability

'Customers are going to see massive amounts of faster data speeds to their mobile phones.'

In some places carriers are getting pushback from residents who don't want new cell towers taking up space in their town.

Residents of Beacon New York have an ongoing petition on Change.org demanding Verizon stop the construction of a 125-foot-tall cell tower in a local cemetery.

The petition argues that building the tower will displace animals like deer bears and foxes and put their homes and children at risk.

They also argue that a cell tower in their backyards will put off people's ability to sell their homes.

'This cell tower is being proposed as a short-term solution with long-term ramifications and decreased property values falling on us the taxpayers and homeowners' the petition says.

Aside from waiting for or fighting against new cell towers to go up in your area cellphone users can take several steps to ensure they are getting the best possible service.

Keeping your phone's software up-to-date is imperative because it fixes any known issues or bugs in its operating system.

It also improves your phone's overall performance and functionality while ignoring the updates can make your phone slow down.

Users can also check their cell plan some of which have soft data caps – even unlimited plans – which will drastically slow your service down without your knowledge.

The late pianist and conductor was an unlikely musical thinker taking raw material from anywhere — classical jazz disco K-pop — and spinning it into artistic gold.

Nero is at least partly the musical godfather of “A Very Philly Christmas” which opened its nine-concert run Friday night in Verizon Hall. The circumstances are all different now but some elements of the show remain familiar. The musicians on stage the No Name Pops were largely the same as ones who played in the Philly Pops the group that Nero led for decades and which now lies in tatters. And this new iteration of a pops Christmas experience retains at least some of the variety show aspect that Nero owned. It’s not every day that you get a kickline of two singers and eight dancing Santas.

The “Very Philly Christmas” concept something that plays to our sense of proud provincial quirkiness is a strong one. But in its programming choices this show is more a “Somewhat Philly Christmas.” Most of the tunes at these concerts led by conductor Enrico Lopez-Yañez are traditional Christmas carols and standards in arrangements and orchestrations ranging from interesting to bland. Thank goodness for the No Name Pops Choir and Gospel Choir of the African Episcopal Church of St. Thomas which kicked up the program’s verve several notches.

There’s a Broadway feel to much of the music. Soprano Kristina Nicole Miller had a big sound but was at her best in the intimacy of “Who Would Imagine a King.” Tenor Christian Dante White did an admirable job in the program’s standout moment when the mere mention of a new songwriter’s name moved the audience response from polite to a roar.

No wonder. You don’t get much more Philly than Jason Kelce whose “Santa’s Night” got an orchestral version world premiere. A bit of cultural translation for non-sports fans. “Santa’s Night” is a single by Kelce a center for the Eagles from A Philly Special Christmas Special an album featuring Kelce and fellow Eagles Jordan Mailata and Lane Johnson. Is it the next great American Christmas song? Probably not. It’s a ballad in three-quarter time with a limited amount of harmonic variety though White gave the lyric shape and meaning. Clever of Lopez-Yañez who did the orchestration to assign a quick spotlight moment to the sax near the end — an ode to Kelce who plays the sax.

Lopez-Yañez doubled as emcee for the evening and he’s plenty likable. The newly named principal pops conductor of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra who made a habit of sprinting into place on stage deftly handled his most challenging assignment: conducting a girl and boy from the audience who were invited to come up and play sleigh bells and a percussion whip in Leroy Anderson’s Sleigh Ride.

Little Chloe 5½ missed her first whip entrance by a hair but when Lopez-Yañez was able to calculate the timing of the cue she needed she nailed it and the audience cheered. It was no less cute when later in the piece her attention strayed and she began looking at things other than the performance at hand. It was a totally lovely and unrehearsed moment a snapshot of childhood at holiday time that may have been the evening’s best and most authentic touch.

“A Very Philly Christmas” continues through Dec. 23 at Verizon Hall Broad and Spruce Streets. Tickets are $29-$109 kimmelculturalcampus.org or 215-893-1999."

Then in December 2021 after transferring to Cornell University she received an experimental medicine that used a revolutionary gene-editing technology to treat inherited diseases. It freed her from excruciating bouts of pain and the frequent blood transfusions that are a mainstay of sickle cell treatment.

Marie Tornyenu missed more than 100 days of high school while hospitalized repeatedly for sickle cell disease an inherited blood disorder that causes crippling pain. Somehow she still managed to complete at least eight advanced placement courses play clarinet in the school band and get admitted to Boston University.

The life-changing drug developed by Boston-based Vertex and its Swiss partner CRISPR Therapeutics is expected to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration by Friday for people with severe cases of the disease. Called Casgevy it would usher in a new era not only for those with sickle cell but also for medicine: The drug would be the first gene-editing therapy authorized by US regulators and uses a tool called CRISPR.

The likely approval — Casgevy was cleared by British regulators last month — raises both the promise of cures for diseases as well as the ethical concerns that come with the power to manipulate the building blocks of human life. With an expected price tag in the seven figures it also touches on issues of equity in medicine.

Sickle cell primarily afflicts people of African descent. Research on the disease languished for decades which many experts blame on structural racism particularly in funding.

For Tornyenu Casgevy has meant an end to the searing pain crises that caused her to miss a week of classes every month as a high school senior. After getting the treatment she took the spring semester off from Cornell to recover from the debilitating effects of chemotherapy that made room in her blood marrow for gene-edited cells.

But now she no longer dreads the arrival of cold weather which would often induce excruciating pain in her hips and legs. A senior at Cornell she has a job lined up as a consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Boston after graduation.

“I’m very hopeful [Casgevy] will be approved” she said “because I don’t know what I would have done otherwise.”

The gene-editing method that became known as CRISPR was first reported in a landmark 2012 paper by American biochemist Jennifer Doudna of the University of California Berkeley and French microbiologist Emmanuelle Charpentier of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology. They would share the 2020 Nobel Prize in chemistry for their work on the tool.

Sickle cell was an obvious choice for scientists to tackle with CRISPR. It was the first human disorder understood on a molecular level its underpinnings explained in a landmark 1949 paper written by the future two-time Nobel laureate Linus Pauling. Yet progress against the disease was slow for decades afterward.

Sickle cell affects hemoglobin the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. It causes the round flexible blood cells to deform into a sickle shape and stick to vessel walls. That deprives tissues of oxygen causing crushing pain that can often only be relieved with opioids and blood transfusions.

Sickle cell can also lead to strokes damage organs and cause early death. A 2019 study in JAMA Network Open estimated the life expectancy of adults with sickle cell in the US is 54 years about 20 years shorter than the general population.

In a clinical trial Casgevy demonstrated remarkable results. The medicine completely relieved 29 of 30 sickle cell patients of debilitating episodes of pain for at least one year among trial participants who were followed for at least 18 months according to Vertex. The patients received a one-time intravenous infusion of edited stem cells that flipped a genetic switch to restore their blood cells’ ability to carry oxygen throughout their bodies.

“This is what a potential cure looks like” said Dr. Stephan Grupp chief of the Cellular Therapy and Transplant Section at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. He was the principal investigator at the trial site where Tornyenu got Casgevy and was paid by Vertex to help organize the study at locations across the US.

About 100000 Americans most of them Black or Hispanic are believed to have sickle cell. The Vertex-CRISPR treatment was geared for those with severe and repeated pain crises roughly 20000 people in the US. As of 2021 almost 8 million people around the world live with sickle cell according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle.

The FDA has approved four medicines for the disorder but none has been remotely as effective as Casgevy which is expected to cost more than $1 million for a one-time infusion in the US according to experts. (No price has been announced in the United Kingdom.) Sickle cell can be cured with a bone-marrow transplant but few patients have compatible donors.

Patients are already inquiring about Casgevy said Dr. Sharl Azar a hematologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and medical director of its Comprehensive Sickle Cell Disease Treatment Center. He said he is eager to see whether the FDA clears it how broad the approval would be and whether Medicare and Medicaid would cover it.

“There’s a lot of unknowns that we’re looking forward to working out in the coming months” he said. “But I think everyone from patients to providers recognizes that this is a big deal.”

Rahman Oladigbolu a 52-year-old Harvard-educated filmmaker in Brockton is among local patients interested in Casgevy. He has had six joints — his hips shoulders and knees — surgically replaced since 2000 because of damage from sickle cell. He walks with a cane at times often gets lightheaded and takes opioids to relieve persistent pain.

When Oladigbolu was growing up in Nigeria his grandmother would take him to traditional medicine men and medicine women who prescribed herbs and potions some of which they rubbed into his aching limbs after cutting him with a razor blade. He moved to the US when he was 28 and currently takes a sickle cell drug called crizanlizumab which reduces his pain but doesn’t eliminate it.

“Pursuing a cure has been like a side job all my life” said Oladigbolu who receives treatment at Boston Medical Center.

CRISPR-based treatments will likely be approved for other disorders in the coming years experts say although its hard to predict for what and when. Researchers including scientists at multiple biotech companies and hospitals in Massachusetts are studying the potential of gene editing for a variety of diseases from ALS to forms of cancer.

“There will be other gene-editing therapies certainly but each disease is different” said Dr. Stuart Orkin a researcher at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children’s Hospital who in 2008 helped identify the gene that Casgevy snips to treat sickle cell. “For some diseases it’s not clear what to edit. People will argue about what’s the right target. Each one is a special case.”

Gene editing has also raised ethical concerns. In 2018 a Chinese scientist He Jiankui was widely condemned when he announced that he used CRISPR to edit DNA in human embryos to try to make them immune to HIV. The experiment sparked fears that He had opened the door to creating so-called designer babies — children whose genetic makeup is altered to produce desired traits.

Dr. George Q. Daley dean of Harvard Medical School was among those who said He’s experiment raised the specter of a Brave New World of eugenics. Casgevy he said recently is completely different. The modifications it makes to DNA only helps sickle cell patients and cannot be passed on to their children.

Daley’s bigger worry concerns access to Casgevy. While wealthy countries like the US have hospitals and doctors capable of preparing patients for the treatment and administering it he said millions of people with sickle cell in sub-Saharan Africa don’t have those options.

“This is a triumph of modern biomedicine” he said. “The major ethical concerns now are issues of cost and equitable distribution.”

Casgevy isn’t the only gene-based medicine on the horizon for sickle cell. The Somerville biotech Bluebird Bio hopes the FDA approves a so-called gene therapy lovo-cel by Dec. 20. It also proved remarkably effective in clinical trials.

Unlike Casgevy which cuts a gene lovo-cel adds a modified gene into a patient’s DNA to enable blood cells to deliver oxygen. The FDA has approved at least eight gene therapies for mostly rare diseases since 2017.

Both Casgevy and lovo-cel are expected to be breathtakingly expensive. That has renewed questions about whether the health care system can afford such cutting-edge medicines.

Still the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review or ICER an independent Boston-based drug-pricing watchdog estimates that either drug could cost nearly $2 million and be worth it given the cumulative costs of treating sickle cell over a lifetime and the benefits the new approaches would bring to patients and families.

Casgevy which was called exa-cel in clinical trials works by editing a patient’s bone marrow stem cells to make high levels of fetal hemoglobin — the healthy oxygen-carrying form of hemoglobin produced during fetal development that is replaced by adult hemoglobin soon after birth.

Unlike adult hemoglobin fetal hemoglobin resists forming a crescent shape in sickle cell patients and scientists have long searched for a way to restart it. The researchers behind Casgevy solved the problem by editing a gene called BCL11A which regulates fetal hemoglobin.

The treatment involves multiple steps over several months. Patients must donate stem cells to be modified at a laboratory. Then donors have to undergo a grueling regimen of chemotherapy to make room in their bone marrow for the genetically altered cells. Finally the patients get the cells back through a single infusion.

Dr. David Altshuler Vertex’s chief scientific officer acknowledged that the gene-editing treatment is “extremely complex and resource intensive.” He said Vertex is researching the possibility of developing a pill that could do what Casgevy does without gene editing. (Vertex’s business partner for Casgevy CRISPR Therapeutics is based in Zug Switzerland but has most of its workforce in Boston.)

FDA officials have raised concerns about the possibility that Casgevy could inadvertently change patients’ DNA beyond the targeted disease — so-called off-target editing. Dr. Daniel E. Bauer a staff physician at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children’s Hospital told an FDA advisory panel on Oct. 31 that Casgevy contains hundreds of millions of edited cells and one could undoubtedly go off target and cause leukemia. But he described the risk as “modest” given the benefits of the treatment.

Altshuler said recently that “there is no evidence to date of off-target editing but it is important to be humble and to continue to follow patients.” Vertex and CRISPR have pledged to follow trial participants for 15 years to make sure they stay healthy.

Tornyenu the Cornell student says she considers Casgevy a miracle and would celebrate Dec. 8 every year if the FDA approves the drug that day.

“For lack of a better term” she said “it’s a big FU to sickle cell.”

The treatment was developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals and CRISPR Therapeutics after conducting a series of successful clinical trials in the UK US France Italy and Germany among others.



Following the UK MHRA’s authorisation to use CASGEVY Bahrain is the second country in the world and the first in the region to approve this treatment.

This extraordinary development opens up new possibilities for medical advancements and reinforces Bahrain's commitment to pioneering healthcare solutions offering a better quality of life for patients with these blood disorders.

CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) is a revolutionary gene-editing technique that holds immense potential for treating a wide range of genetic disorders. By harnessing the power of CRISPR scientists can transfuse patients with their own edited stem cells to produce fully functioning hemoglobin and offer hope for patients with conditions that were previously considered untreatable such as sickle cell anemia.

By embracing the revolutionary therapy Bahrain is not only demonstrating its commitment to improving the health and well-being of its people but also positioning itself at the forefront of medical advancements in the region.

Her Excellency Dr Jaleela Jawad Minister of Health stated ""This authorization showcases Bahrain's progressive approach to healthcare and its determination to remain at the forefront of scientific breakthroughs.""

The confirmation of approval by the National Health Regulatory Authority (NHRA) of the Kingdom of Bahrain followed thorough analysis and review undertaken by NHRA. Today sickle-cell patients in Bahrain suffer from the very limited globally available options of treatment. Beyond bone marrow transplant one of the only cures available for sickle cell disease is the use of genetic editing therapy CASGEVY.

Commenting on this Dr. Ahmed Alansari CEO of the National Health Regulatory Authority in Bahrain said “The approval of the use of CASGEVY in Bahrain marks a significant turning point in the cluster of treatments on offer to Bahrainis. It is a testament to the country's visionary leadership dedication to innovation and unwavering commitment to improving the lives of its citizens while ushering in the highest quality of health care and wellbeing for them.”

With 2023 almost behind us it's a great time to think about the new investing year just ahead. This doesn't mean you should completely revamp your portfolio but instead consider what may be missing from your holdings -- and if you have some cash available and the price of a particular stock is right make those additions.

One area to focus on is companies that generally offer steady earnings growth over time. Healthcare is the perfect place to find these players since patients need their medicines or procedures no matter what the economy is doing. Within this group you'll find tried-and-true names as well as up-and-coming players that may deliver an extra dose of growth.

Let's take a look at five of these top stocks to add to your portfolio before the new year.

1. CRISPR Therapeutics

CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP 1.92%) just reached a huge milestone and another may be just ahead. The company recently won the world's first authorization for a CRISPR-based gene-editing treatment when the U.K. gave the nod to exa-cel (to be commercialized as Casgevy). U.S. regulators are set to decide on the blood disorders treatment for sickle cell disease this month -- then for beta thalassemia in March.

This is big because it represents product revenue just ahead and this revenue could reach blockbuster levels. It's also a key event because it serves as a vote of confidence for the technology CRISPR Therapeutics uses across its pipeline. The company even has another candidate -- potential immuno-oncology treatment CTX-110 -- involved in a late-stage study that could support a regulatory request.

Meanwhile CRISPR Therapeutics stock is trading at a much lower level than it did in the past when we had less visibility about the future. Considering that this biotech is in the early stages of its story over time the shares could soar from today's level.

2. Eli Lilly

Eli Lilly (LLY -0.30%) has taken center stage thanks to its diabetes drug Mounjaro which doctors also have been prescribing for weight loss. In fact Mounjaro and rival products have become so popular that patients have faced shortages of the drugs as supply can't keep up with demand.

Lilly is increasing production capacity and in more good news the company recently won regulatory approval for the same molecule to specifically address weight loss. Lilly will sell the product as Zepbound. Mounjaro brought in $1.4 billion in sales during the most recent quarter so there's reason to be optimistic about the potential of both drugs to drive growth.

But Lilly isn't about just one or two products or one treatment area. The company sells dozens of products in areas including immunology cancer and neuroscience. And these drugs helped the company increase revenue 37% in the quarter with new products and growth products leading the gains.

Considering current growth and future potential thanks to new and high-growth products Lilly shares even after recent gains are likely to head higher over time.

3. Vertex Pharmaceuticals

Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX -1.21%) is known for its leadership in the global cystic fibrosis (CF) treatment market and its CF drugs have brought in billions of dollars in earnings. This is set to continue into the next decade thanks to current products and a very promising candidate in pivotal development right now.

So we can be confident about the CF program generating billion-dollar earnings well into the future. But Vertex is about to offer patients and investors even more. The company partnered with CRISPR Therapeutics on Casgevy -- so will benefit from sales there.

And Vertex is working on a candidate to address the very common problem of pain with VX-548 on track to complete its pivotal program by the end of this year. The company aims to share data from the trial early next year and if it's positive a commercial launch may not be far off.

You'll love Vertex for its all of the above -- and its reasonable valuation as it trades for 23x forward earnings estimates.

4. Intuitive Surgical

Intuitive Surgical (ISRG 0.13%) is the worldwide leader in robotic surgery with its flagship da Vinci system now installed in 8285 locations. What I like most about Intuitive is its moat or competitive advantage which should ensure ongoing market leadership.

Robotic systems cost millions of dollars so it's unlikely hospitals will easily switch to another provider if they're satisfied with the current platform. Also most doctors train on the da Vinci so they probably will support the idea of sticking with a system they know well.

I also like the fact that Intuitive generates most of its revenue not from selling the surgical robots -- but from selling the instruments and accessories needed for each surgery. This is great because it represents recurrent revenue and practically guarantees that every da Vinci sold or leased will keep generating income for Intuitive.

Intuitive shares have climbed this year but they're still trading lower in relation to forward earnings estimates than they were a couple of years ago. This and solid future prospects make the stock a great deal today.

5. Pfizer

Pfizer's (PFE -0.32%) revenue surged to record highs last year thanks to its coronavirus vaccine and treatment but today the big pharma faces two challenges: a decline in coronavirus product revenue and upcoming losses of exclusivity of certain older blockbusters.

That's soured some investors on Pfizer but this actually creates a top buying opportunity for the rest of us. The stock now trades for only 18.4 times forward earnings estimates.

Why buy Pfizer now? Because the company is set to compensate for patent losses and grow beyond them. Pfizer is in the middle of its biggest launch streak ever -- releasing 19 new products or indications over an 18-month period. It's completed 13 launches so far showing it's well on the way to meeting the goal.

Pfizer predicts non-COVID program revenues could reach $84 billion by 2030 representing more than 60% growth from pre-pandemic revenue.

Meanwhile you also can count on Pfizer for passive income -- the company is making dividend growth a priority and delivers a dividend yield that's higher than that of the S&P 500.

All of this makes Pfizer a top addition to your portfolio now so that you'll benefit from passive income in 2024 and likely share performance over time.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZXRyb2l0bmV3cy5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9taWNoaWdhbi8yMDIzLzEyLzAzL3RyYW5zZm9ybWF0aXZlLWdlbmV0aWMtdGhlcmFwaWVzLWZvci1zaWNrbGUtY2VsbC1kaXNlYXNlLW9uLXRoZS1ob3Jpem9uLzcxNTgxMzc5MDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Effective' genetic therapies for sickle cell disease on the horizon,"Your subscription supports:

With the late 2023 rally underway investors can bolster their portfolios by adding a select group of dividend payers into the mix. Dividend-paying stocks give investors a combination of potential price appreciation and income which can enhance total returns. Bearing that in mind here are five attractive dividend stocks according to Wall Street's top experts on TipRanks a platform that ranks analysts based on their past performance.

Energy Transfer

First on this week's list is Energy Transfer (ET) a limited partnership that operates a diversified portfolio of energy assets in the U.S. with nearly 125000 miles of pipelines. ET recently completed its acquisition of Crestwood Equity Partners. In October ET declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.3125 per common unit for the third quarter which was paid on Nov. 20. The stock has a dividend yield of 9%. Commenting on the third-quarter results RBC Capital analyst Elvira Scotto said that Energy Transfer delivered a solid performance with adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization exceeding the consensus estimate by 7%. The analyst also noted the increase in the 2023 midpoint adjusted EBITDA outlook by $300 million. Scotto expects the Crestwood acquisition to offer commercial synergies. Further she pointed out that ET intends to maintain a strong balance sheet aiming for leverage of 4.0-4.5x debt/EBITDA. Also ET aims to continue to return cash to unitholders via increased distribution and potential buybacks. ""With high return growth projects accretive acquisitions and its integrated asset footprint across hydrocarbons and basins we believe ET can generate significant cash flow in the coming years"" said Scotto. Scotto increased her price target on Energy Transfer to $19 from $18 and reiterated a buy rating calling the stock a compelling investment opportunity. She ranks No. 54 among more than 8700 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Her ratings have been profitable 65% of the time with each delivering an average return of 18.1%. (See Energy Transfer Insider Trading Activity on TipRanks)

Sunoco LP

Scotto is also upbeat about another limited partnership: Sunoco (SUN) one of the leading motor fuel distributors in the U.S. For the third quarter Sunoco announced a quarterly cash distribution of $0.8420 per unit paid on Nov. 20. The company's dividend yield stands at 6.3%. After Sunoco posted its quarterly results Scotto raised the price target for SUN stock to $57 from $51 to reflect a higher earnings outlook. The analyst reiterated a buy rating saying that the company's volumes and margins surpassed her estimates. The analyst thinks that the company's scale procurement ability and lower cost structure compared to the industry enable it to deliver beyond the industry's breakeven margin. ""SUN continues to maintain a strong balance sheet exiting 3Q23 with leverage of 3.9x and total liquidity of $1.1BN which provides SUN with significant financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities including acquisitions."" Overall Scotto remains bullish on Sunoco due to its solid cash flows and focus on breakeven margins and expense management. (See Sunoco Hedge Funds Trading Activity on TipRanks)

VICI Properties

Our next dividend stock is VICI Properties (VICI) a real estate investment trust. VICI owns a solid portfolio of gaming hospitality and entertainment properties including the properties of the iconic Caesars Palace Las Vegas and MGM Grand. For the third quarter the company declared a cash dividend of $0.415 per share reflecting a 6.4% increase. VICI offers a dividend yield of 5.4%. In a recent research note Stifel analyst Simon Yarmak who ranks 573rd out of more than 8700 analysts tracked by TipRanks reiterated a buy rating on VICI stock and called it one of his top ideas in the North American triple-net REITs sector. Yarmak noted that VICI has performed well in both gaming and non-gaming categories. He added that VICI's tenants remain in a strong position. ""VICI has negotiated favorable escalators in its leases which provide strong internal growth. Many of these escalators are linked to uncapped CPI growth (50.0% of rent) and therefore VICI should benefit from meaningful lease escalations in the above-average inflationary environment"" noted Yarmak. The analyst estimates that lease escalations would generate about $71 million of incremental rent in 2024 which was not captured in the 2023 results. He expects VICI to post some of the best year-over-year growth in 2024 in the triple-net sector with nearly 4.5% to 5.0% adjusted funds from operations growth. Yarmak's ratings have been successful 54% of the time with each one delivering an average return of 8%. (See VICI's Options Activity on TipRanks)

Home Depot

We move to home improvement retailer Home Depot (HD). The company exceeded analysts' fiscal third-quarter estimates despite a decline in sales due to pressure in certain big-ticket discretionary categories. However the company narrowed its full-year outlook due to macro pressures. For the third quarter the company declared a cash dividend of $2.09 per share payable on Dec. 14. HD's dividend yield stands at 2.6%. Following the fiscal third-quarter results JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers lowered the price target for HD stock to $318 from $332 but maintained a buy rating saying that Home Depot is managing well against a tough backdrop. The analyst thinks that management's tone was less optimistic versus the second quarter but not worse than the first quarter. While the home improvement category is expected to remain under pressure in the first half of 2024 comparable sales are projected to recover in the second half. ""We believe HD remains one of the best long-term stories in retail given company-specific sales and margin initiatives the duopoly/AMZN-resistant nature of the industry and significant financial and operating leverage that amplifies EPS growth in better sales environments"" said Horvers. Horvers ranks No. 520 among more than 8700 analysts on TipRanks. His ratings have been profitable 61% of the time with each delivering an average return of 8%.

Significantly high institutional ownership implies Visa's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions

39% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders

Recent sales by insiders

To get a sense of who is truly in control of Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 77% ownership. That is the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).

Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight especially with individual investors. Hence having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.

In the chart below we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Visa.

Check out our latest analysis for Visa

What Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Visa?

Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.

Visa already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Visa's earnings history below. Of course the future is what really matters.

Since institutional investors own more than half the issued stock the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Visa. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group Inc. is the largest shareholder with 7.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.2% and 3.6% of the stock.

Our studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.

While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting too.

Insider Ownership Of Visa

The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business but the CEO will answer to the board even if he or she is a member of it.

Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.

Our information suggests that Visa Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively they own US$212m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling.

General Public Ownership

The general public-- including retail investors -- own 23% stake in the company and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.

Next Steps:

I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight we need to consider other information too. Be aware that Visa is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis  you should know about...

You can skip our comprehensive analysis and proceed directly to the 5 Biggest Countries that Qualify for the Green Card Lottery.

The Diversity Immigrant Visa Program commonly referred to as the Green Card Lottery is an initiative that allocates a maximum of 50000 immigrant visas annually through a randomized selection method. Since its initiation in 1990 its primary objective has been to enhance the diversity of immigrants in the United States by granting visas to individuals hailing from nations with minimal immigration rates. Interested participants are required to complete a straightforward online form within the stipulated registration window typically spanning from early October to early November.

The Diversity Visa Program comprises a ten-step process: submitting an entry applicant selection confirmation of selection confirming qualifications submitting the visa application providing supporting documents attending an interview preparing for it undergoing the interview and managing post-interview procedures. This systematic approach guides applicants through the program's stages toward potential immigration opportunities.

Successful candidates and their immediate families upon selection gain the opportunity to secure permanent residency in the United States. Notably the application process is free and winners are chosen randomly by a computer. Those selected must fulfill the same criteria as any other US Green Card applicant. Notification for successful applicants generally occurs approximately 7 months after submission and the government may take up to 14 months to arrange interviews and issue visas.

According to Travel.State.Gov the entry window for the DV-2025 Diversity Visa Program was open from October 4 2023 to November 7 2023. As of now no entries are being accepted. As of September 5 2023 over 54000 status issuances/adjustments have been recorded globally out of the 54833 Diversity Visas (DVs) allocated for fiscal 2023. Moreover according to US immigration regulations no individual country can obtain more than 7% of the total available DVs within a single fiscal year.

The American Dream highlights restrictions on Green Card Lottery participation barring individuals from specific countries. According to the current regulations those born in Bangladesh Brazil Canada China (including Hong Kong SAR) Colombia Dominican Republic El Salvador Haiti Honduras India Jamaica Mexico Nigeria Pakistan Philippines South Korea Venezuela and Vietnam cannot apply for the program. These exclusions are based on historical immigration rates to the United States and aim to diversify the pool of immigrants entering the country through this particular visa program.

Story continues

In certain regions particularly in Africa the Green Card Lottery can yield more than 3500 winners due to the random selection process. Countries with higher applicant numbers like Egypt Ethiopia Ghana Cameroon and the Congo might generate more winners proportionally. However the actual successful applicants tend to be lower due to factors like some winners not proceeding with the application educational and professional disparities and financial constraints.

To maintain immigration diversity a cap of 3500 Green Cards per participating country is set processing only the first 3500 qualified responses in cases of overflow. Countries with fewer winners have higher chances of obtaining the desired immigrant visa if all requirements are met during the acceptance process usually assisted within the service tariff for customers.

Diversity Immigrant Visa Program: Impact on the US Economy

The Green Card lottery enables immigrants from less represented nations to enrich diverse sectors such as technology healthcare and entrepreneurship. Their presence fuels innovation and economic expansion evidenced by their entrepreneurial ventures elevated rates of business inception and substantial tax contributions. This not only boosts consumer expenditure and government revenue but also aids in tackling demographic hurdles.

According to The White House immigrants significantly contribute to the U.S. economy by expanding the labor force and boosting productivity. Economists find that immigrants being more mobile in response to economic changes help labor markets function more efficiently. Research also shows that a 1% increase in immigrant college graduates leads to a 9% to 18% rise in patents per capita highlighting their substantial impact on innovation.

It was a special experience for me because my great-great grandfather Rabbi Henry Berkowitz served as the second rabbi of this congregation from 1892–1921. I felt meaningful belonging when the rabbi explicitly stated that transgender Jews are welcome. Sadly the tone shifted when the rabbi spoke to one of her largest audiences of the year about why she rejects the call for Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) against the State of Israel slandering this nonviolent strategy (built on the success of the South African anti-apartheid movement) as antisemitic. As a member of Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP) and an active supporter of the Palestinian civil society call for BDS I learned that I was not actually welcome in the congregation with my whole self my full ethical integrity.

This memory came back to me suddenly when I learned that Rodeph Shalom was poised to host a massive fundraising event for the Friends of the IDF (FIDF) with ticket prices up to $36000 at the “Major General” level on November 30. I felt a flood of shame that Rodeph Shalom would host this crass and cynical celebration of militarism while we all witness the devastating wreckage in Gaza the bombed hospitals the soaring civilian death tolls the dead babies the people told to flee with nowhere to escape no water no food no fuel.

Do the congregants support this? Most of them don’t even know their spiritual home was used this way. The event was not listed on the Rodeph Shalom (RS) website not openly advertised to the membership. It was posted on the FIDF website with no location acknowledged — apparently aware that a public event of this kind would and should be protested. An invitee leaked the details compelled to speak out against this celebration of death and destruction. In reaching out to members of the RS community I spoke to many who were shocked and upset to learn of the event and agreed to share their concern with the leadership.

Members of JVP IfNotNow and others in the Philadelphia Jewish community have been mobilizing by the thousands almost daily to cry out for a ceasefire to say NOT IN MY NAME to Israel’s extremist right-wing government and our elected officials in Pennsylvania and DC. In Philly we held a vigil counter to the FIDF gala on Thursday night. At the same time a group of young Israelis disrupted an FIDF event in Manhattan.

What would Rabbi Berkowitz say? I don’t have to guess. He was among the loudest voices of anti-Zionism in the early days of Zionist mobilization and a member of the National Committee of Rabbis Opposed to Zionism. In 1899 he published the essay “Why I Oppose Zionism” in the Central Conference of American Rabbis Journal touring the country to speak out on this theme.

In 1919 Rabbi Berkowitz co-organized a petition signed by three hundred prominent U.S. Jews which was published in the New York Times and delivered to the Paris Peace Conference. The 1919 statement addressed to President Woodrow Wilson made prescient points in opposition to the Zionist movement including warnings that Zionists underestimated Muslim and Christian Palestinians’ allegiance to the land that Zionism’s assurance of respect for other communities under Jewish dominance were incompatible with real equality democracy or the safety of the global Jewish community.

Like my rabbinic ancestor I’m a longtime anti-Zionist. JVP Philadelphia’s inbox overflows with Jews and other allies reaching out to join in calls for peace and for an end to the occupation and the unjust conditions that can only yield more violence.

Rodeph Shalom is generally a progressive synagogue with active commitments to racial and economic justice and LGBTQ+ inclusion. Shame on the RS administration for hosting this private mega-fundraiser for the Israeli military — even more absurd given that the IDF already receives over $3 billion a year from the U.S. Government with an additional $14.3 billion recently proposed by the Biden administration.

I truly hope the congregants will demand that their spiritual home never be used this way again.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNsaWNrb25kZXRyb2l0LmNvbS9uZXdzL2xvY2FsLzIwMjMvMDUvMzEvdGhlLWRpc2FwcGVhcmFuY2Utb2YtZGFuaWVsbGUtc3Rpc2xpY2tpLWFuZC10aGUtdHJpYWwtb2YtZmxveWQtZ2FsbG93YXkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The disappearance of Danielle Stislicki and the trial of Floyd Galloway,"FARMINGTON HILLS Mich. – It has been seven years since Danielle Stislicki vanished.

Stislicki walked out of her office on Dec. 2 2016 and was never seen again. Her body has never been found. Floyd Galloway a security guard who worked in her office has been charged with her murder.

Stislicki’s family has acknowledged that they may never find her body but they will not stop fighting for justice.

“There’s overwhelming probable cause that defendant Floyd Galloway Jr. committed that crime” Judge James Brady of 47th District Court in Farmington Hills said in 2019.

The day Danielle Stislicki disappeared

Dec. 2 2016 was a cold Friday night.

Stislicki 28 left work at around 5 p.m. Witnesses said they saw her leaving the parking lot of her MetLife office on Telegraph Road in Southfield with Galloway.

According to prosecutors Galloway was known to seek out or flirt with Stislicki and had previously sent her flowers.

Galloway told police he had worked until 11 p.m. that night. Investigators later learned that Galloway did not work and had called off for a “doctor appointment.”

The witness said that night Galloway was in the parking lot with the hood up on his Buick Regal -- indicating he had car trouble according to court documents.

Her coworker told police that they later saw Galloway in the passenger seat of Stislicki’s Jeep Renegade. They said Stislicki was leaving the parking lot and waiting to turn north onto Telegraph Road.

Prosecutors said Stislicki’s phone pinged with a cellular tower nearest to Galloway’s home in Berkley.

Stislicki had plans to get to dinner with her best friend that evening but did not show up and did not contact her friend.

She was never seen again.

Jeep Renegade found at her apartment

On Dec. 3 2016 Stislicki’s Jeep Renegade was found outside her apartment.

Stislicki’s best friend the one she was supposed to have dinner with the night before contacted Stislicki’s parents and they went to her apartment in the Independence Green complex in Farmington Hills.

“Just the fact that Dani did not show up for dinner that night -- that alone was completely out of character for her” Michigan State Police Lt. Sarah Krebbs said in 2020.

When they arrived they found her vehicle in its normal spot -- just eight feet from her door. Her purse ID and credit cards were found inside her vehicle. Her phone a Samsung Galaxy Core Prime with a rose-gold case and keys were missing. They contacted the police and initiated the first missing person report.

Her belongings and her cat were still in her apartment. Police weren’t sure if she drove the Jeep to her apartment or if someone else did.

On Dec. 19 2016 police announced that they believed Stislicki was the victim of a crime.

Galloway takes lie detector test

Galloway took a lie detector test on Dec. 9 2016 seven days after Stislicki vanished.

The test was ordered by the attorney that Galloway himself had hired. That attorney had James Hoppe a former FBI agent administer the lie detector test.

Something Galloway said during the test disturbed Hoppe so much that he called his personal friend and then chief of police of the Troy police Gary Mayer and relayed what he learned during the test.

Mayer shared the information with Farmington Hills police Chief Chuck Nebus who was investigating the case.

“Chief Nebus typed up a standard form tip sheet they use in all these cases” prosecutor Danielle Russo Bennetts said. “These officers then go out to a location and recover property belonging to Miss Stislicki.”

Nebus termed the tip anonymous. This tip and the way it was handled would later taint key evidence in the trial against Galloway.

Investigators search Galloway’s home

On Dec. 22 2016 police searched Galloway’s home for evidence in Stislicki’s disappearance.

They discovered that a patch of carpet had recently been replaced in his bedroom. They tested the carpet adjacent to the replaced patch and found “very strong support” that Stislicki’s DNA was on the carpet.

Investigators also discovered that Galloway had purchased a new comforter from Bed Bath and Beyond on Dec. 4 2016 -- two days after Stislicki vanished.

Sources told Local 4 that police also removed a car from the garage.

Then-Farmington Hills Police Chief Chuck Nebus released the following statement on Dec. 23 2016.

“Farmington Hills detectives and members of the Oakland County Sheriff’s Office Crime Lab were at a home in Berkley last night investigating the disappearance of Danielle Stislicki. Farmington Hills detectives and investigators from several other agencies have been involved in searches and the collection of evidence at numerous locations over the past three weeks. Detectives evidence technicians and crime lab personnel from several law enforcement agencies have been working tirelessly and remain committed to finding Danielle and solving this case. The investigation has been progressing since day one. I understand a caring public and media are anxious for information. However no information will be released regarding the specifics of the case in order to maintain the integrity of the investigation.”

What prosecutors say happened the night Stislicki vanished

A court document broke down what prosecutors say evidence shows happened the night Stislicki vanished.

8 p.m.: Stislicki’s phone communicates with towers on the route between Galloway’s home and her apartment. Security footage shows a vehicle matching hers moving toward her apartment.

8:40 p.m.: Security camera footage from Tim Horton’s (a 10 minute walk from Stislicki’s apartment) shows Galloway getting coffee and using the business’ phone. Police later found her keys and FitBit in the area between her apartment and the Tim Horton’s.

9 p.m.: Cab driver says she picked up Galloway from Tim Horton’s and dropped him off at an apartment complex about 1000 feet from the workplace parking lot.

9:35 p.m.: A vehicle matching Galloway’s was found on security cameras driving toward his home.

Galloway told a judge on Nov. 21 2017 that he had tried to rape a woman on Sept. 4 2016 when she was jogging at Hines Park in Livonia.

The woman testified that she went jogging at about 6 p.m. that day. She said she ran 4-and-a-half miles in Hines Park before turning around to go back to her car.

She said she took a path into a secluded wooded area and saw Galloway approaching her on the path. She said as they passed each other he turned around and grabbed her from behind. A struggle ensued.

She said he had an arm around her neck and dragged her into the woods. She testified that he got on top of her and she yelled at him “What do you want? Why are you doing this? What do you want?”

She said Galloway answered “I just want sex.”

She said he began to punch and choke her. She pleaded with him to let her go and said she had a family and a daughter. He then told her that he would let her go and left.

When he left she flagged down two cars along Hines Drive and called 911. The 911 call can be heard below.

Galloway pleaded guilty to assault with intent to cause great bodily harm assault with intent to commit sexual penetration and kidnapping. He was sentenced on Dec. 8 2017 and his earliest release date is June 26 2033.

“I saw a woman jogging on a path I was walking on” Galloway said. “As she passed me I pulled her to the ground from behind putting my arm around her neck . . . I began hitting her and choking her. I did all of this in order to have sex with her. After a few minutes I got off of her let her go and I ran away. I did not have sex with her.”

Police search Hines Park for Danielle Stislicki

On July 19 2017 police searched Hines Park.

Several agencies were involved in the search including the FBI Farmington Hills police Livonia police and Michigan State police. Around 14 cadaver dogs were used.

“Law enforcement authorities have expressed since day one that Danielle Stislicki was a victim of a crime” said Farmington Hills Police Chief Chuck Nebus. “The facts of the case lead us to believe she is not alive. Several air land and water searches have been conducted at various places throughout the investigation. Hines Park is being searched as the result of a recent Livonia and Farmington Hills joint investigation. This investigation has led to criminal charges in Livonia against Floyd Galloway a 30-year-old resident of Berkley. Because the Livonia incident occurred in Hines Park it is a location that requires searching. There is no specific information or evidence that leads us to believe Danielle’s remains are in the park.”

Police searched for any signs of her remains at the park -- including items such as a suitcase trunk luggage bags her blue Eddie Bauer 3-in-1 jacket a black zip up jeans and a pair of burgundy boots.

Investigators believed her body could have been wrapped in a tan and brown striped comforter. Since she vanished police have searched woods parks and bodies of water.

Galloway ordered to stand trial

Galloway was ordered to stand trial in Stislicki’s murder on Sept. 10 2019. At a hearing a judge ruled that there was enough evidence to send Galloway to trial in her murder. At that point it had been nearly three years since she vanished.

“There’s overwhelming probable cause that defendant Floyd Galloway Jr. committed that crime” said Judge James Brady of 47th District Court in Farmington Hills.

Prosecutors used phone records that showed Galloway and Stislicki were together the night she vanished. They also showed the surveillance video showing Galloway near her home.

“It was satisfying” said Ann Stislicki Danielle Stislicki’s mother. “He looked at us. He looked at the witnesses that were up rather than cowardly looking down. But he did not look up or around when he left the courtroom.”

The trial continues

On Aug. 17 2022 Galloway appeared for a virtual motion hearing. His attorneys were requesting the judge to wave prosecutors’ privileged information and materials arguing that it’s possible they don’t have access to all of the discovery relevant to the case.

Judge rules to suppress key evidence in murder case

On Nov. 17 2022 a judge ruled to suppress key evidence in the murder case because of how it was obtained.

The decision to suppress the evidence surrounds attorney-client privilege. Galloway allegedly made an admission to the person who was conducting a lie detector test on behalf of his then-attorney. That alleged admission made its way back to investigators who used the information to seize key evidence in the case.

Because of how it was obtained that evidence will not be presented during Galloway’s murder trial. This is a major win for Galloway’s defense. Stislicki’s family said they are “disappointed” in the decision.

“Our family is disappointed on these results and will continue to support the judicial appeal process and effort for the true story to be told. “The public should also be aware that Floyd is currently in prison for sexually attacking a jogger that was fortunate to escape just three months before Danielle went missing.” Ann Stislicki

What evidence will be suppressed?

Galloway’s attorney at the time had him take a lie detector test. James Hoppe conducted the test he was so disturbed by what Galloway told him that he shared that information with then Troy police Chief Gary Mayer.

Mayer shared the information with Farmington Hills police Chief Chuck Nebu who was investigating the case. Nebus had his detectives search for clues and because of what Galloway shared with the lie detector operator much evidence was found.

Investigators found Stislicki’s Fitbit keys and obtained forensic data from cell phones. They also obtained testimony of Galloway being spotted at a nearby Tim Horton’s surveillance video and phone records from the coffee shop and evidence of a cab ride Galloway took that night from where near where Stislicki vanished.

That evidence will not be presented during the trial. A judge ruled that it was seized as a direct result of investigators obtaining privileged information.

The judge concluded that police intentionally intruded on the privileged relationship and used the information to locate and seize evidence. The judge said “the court finds the actions of the government were outrageous.”

“Judge McMillan sent a message to law enforcement and to the attorney general that outrageous conduct in violation of defendant’s due process rights will not be tolerated” Galloway’s attorney said.

Other CSI officers started to pursue Johnson and caught up with her at the intersection of Coreland Drive and Berkley Drive in Madison.

She stopped the Metro Police vehicle she was in and was taken into custody.

WBA,Walgreens Boots Alliance,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzEyLzAyL3dhbGdyZWVucy1ib290cy1hbGxpYW5jZS1zdG9jay1iZWFyLXZzLWJ1bGwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walgreens Boots Alliance Stock: Bear vs. Bull,"Is Walgreens Boots Alliance stock a bargain or a value trap?

Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA 0.91%) pays an incredibly high dividend yield. It's also trading near lows it hasn't seen in years. That's because the business is facing some significant risks as it's no longer getting a boost from COVID vaccine traffic and its financials are hurting. In the midst of all this the company has a new CEO Tim Wentworth.

There's a lot for investors to unpack when it comes to Walgreens Boots Alliance. Below I'll outline the bullish and bearish cases for investing in the stock and whether it's an investment you should consider adding to your portfolio today.

The bullish case for Walgreens Boots Alliance

One of the biggest reasons investors may be bullish on Walgreens' stock these days is its incredibly low valuation. Just when you think the healthcare stock can't get any cheaper it finds a way to go lower. Shares of Walgreens haven't been at their current levels in more than a decade. At 6 times earnings the stock is either a deep value buy or simply a value trap.

For bullish investors it's a value buy. That's because Walgreens is a top pharmacy retailer in the U.S. with a strong brand that people have come to know and trust. It is also building on its trusted brand and branching into primary care as it launches hundreds of clinics at its stores. This year it has also launched virtual healthcare services to build on its healthcare expansion.

Walgreens' core business is also fairly stable with the company normally reporting north of $30 billion in quarterly revenue. The stock offers an incredibly high dividend that yields 9.6% which can provide investors with a significant source of recurring income. It has also increased its dividend payments for decades.

Bullish investors will have you believe that buying the stock today could be a tremendous opportunity to lock in a great dividend and set yourself up for some massive long-term gains as the business grows and the stock rises in value.

The bearish case for Walgreens Boots Alliance

Investors also have plenty of reason to be skeptical about Walgreens' stock despite its hopes for building a robust healthcare business. The most glaring concern is the company's lack of profitability. Walgreens has incurred an operating loss in four of its last five reported quarters.

An even more concerning problem however is that the company's cash balance may not be strong enough to cover both its growth objectives and the dividend. As of the end of August the company had $739 million in cash and marketable securities on its books. Meanwhile over the past year it has spent more than $2.1 billion on additions to plant property and equipment and another $1.7 billion on paying dividends.

That's fine if the company generates plenty of cash flow but Walgreens doesn't. Over the past 12 months its operating cash flow totaled $2.3 billion. The company has been selling investments to free up cash but ultimately it isn't a sustainable strategy for Walgreens to pay its current dividend and pursue an ambitious growth strategy.

The high dividend yield is also indicative of investor sentiment as it implies they are wary of trusting that high a payout. Otherwise they would be scooping it up in a hurry the stock price would rise and the yield would come down. But that isn't happening. Instead investors continue to remain bearish on the business waiting for something big from the new CEO. Whether it's a change in the healthcare strategy or the dividend policy at some point something has to give.

Walgreens is too risky a stock to buy

Shares of Walgreens are down 46% this year and for good reason -- this is a risky stock with an uncertain path forward. The company's financials look abysmal and Walgreens' growth strategy may only prove to be a money pit in the long run. There isn't a clear path for the company to turn its business around and until that changes investors are better off avoiding the stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vZGVybmhlYWx0aGNhcmUuY29tL2F3YXJkcy8yMDIzLW1vc3QtaW5mbHVlbnRpYWwtaGVhbHRoY2FyZS10aW0tYmFycnktdmlsbGFnZW1k0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2023 Most Influential in Healthcare Tim Barry,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.modernhealthcare.com/awards/2023-most-influential-healthcare-tim-barry-villagemd on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vZGVybmhlYWx0aGNhcmUuY29tL2F3YXJkcy8yMDIzLW1vc3QtaW5mbHVlbnRpYWwtaGVhbHRoY2FyZS10aW0tYmFycnktdmlsbGFnZW1k0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Between January and August this year Walmart shipped 25 percent of its U.S. imports from India. That compares to just 2 percent in 2018. Import Yeti a data company shared the information with Reuters.

The same data shows that only 60 percent of Walmart’s imports came from China during the same period down from 80 percent in 2018. China is still Walmart’s biggest country for importing goods.

The shift shows how the rising cost of importing from China and increased tension between China and the U.S. are leading American companies to import from other countries. Those countries include India Thailand and Vietnam.

Andrea Alright is Walmart’s executive vice president of sourcing. She said “We want the best prices.” She added that Walmart has to deal with natural disasters to shortages in materials and cannot be dependent on any one supplier or area for products.

Walmart said the import information did not mean that it was reducing dependence on any of its markets. ""We're a growth business and are working to source more manufacturing capacity"" the company said in a statement. And Albright added that India has become an important part of Walmart’s efforts to build that manufacturing capacity.

Walmart has been increasing growth in India since 2018. It bought 77 percent of shares in the online company Flipkart. Two years later it promised to import $10 billion worth of goods from India each year by 2027. That is a target it is on the way to meet Albright said. It is currently importing around $3 billion worth of goods from India each year.

India’s workforce and technology

Walmart is importing goods including toys electronics sporting equipment and medications from India. Foods like packaged food dry grains and pasta are also popular imports from India Albright told Reuters.

India whose stock market has risen to record highs this year is viewed as the country best equipped to outperform China in low-cost and large amounts of manufacturing.

The South Asian country also has a growing workforce and increasing technological developments. China however recently reported its first population decrease in sixty years.

Walmart started its sourcing operations in the Indian city of Bangalore in 2002. Now the company employs more than 100000 people including temporary workers around the country.

Rising costs from China

The rising cost of shopping goods from China has also added to the shift to India supply chain experts say.

Chris Rogers is a researcher at S&P Global Market Intelligence’s supply chain research group Panjiva. He said “Sourcing from mainland China has become less competitive because of rising labor costs versus other manufacturing centers.”

China's minimum wage ranges between $198.52 to $376.08 monthly. Meanwhile average wages for unskilled and semi-skilled workers in India are between $108.04 and $180.06.

The COVID-19 pandemic showed weaknesses in worldwide supply chains showing U.S. importers were over-dependent on a small number of markets.

Albright said planning for an event like the pandemic is like planning for a natural disaster. She said “What I can control is where my product is coming from and how do I make sure that Christmas still happens if something happens in our supply chain.”

Walmart has joined the growing list of companies suspending their ads on X.

It comes after Elon Musk appeared to endorse an antisemitic post.

Musk said that it was ""a mistake"" and ""one of the most foolish things"" he'd done on the platform.

Walmart announced on Friday that it will stop advertising on Elon Musk's social media platform X formerly known as Twitter.

""We aren't advertising on X as we've found other platforms to better reach our customers"" a Walmart spokeswoman told Bloomberg News.

The retailer which is the largest in the US by sales joins several other major companies including Disney Apple IBM and Warner Bros in pulling ads from the platform since Musk seemingly endorsed an antisemitic post.

But Joe Benarroch X's head of business operations said on CBS MoneyWatch that the company had stopped advertising on X in October ""so this is not a recent pausing.""

In a dig at Walmart on Friday Musk replied to a tweet about the news saying: ""I prefer HEB.""

I prefer HEB — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) December 2 2023

He had harsher words at the DealBook Summit this week raging against big advertisers that have ditched his platform and warning that they could ""kill"" X.

X CEO Lina Yaccarino sent a memo around the company Thursday backing up Musk.

""Our principles do not have a price tag nor will they be compromised — ever"" she wrote. ""No matter how hard they try we will not be distracted by sideline critics who don't understand our mission.""

Musk has since said the post was a ""mistake"" and ""one of the most foolish things"" he'd done on the platform. The controversy could cost the company up to $75 million in ad revenue by the end of 2023 The New York Times reported.

The investor Ross Gerber has said that Musk's X comments have also damaged Tesla saying he'd never seen a CEO do ""so many detrimental things"" to harm a brand.







""I've never had this with any company I've invested in in my entire life where the CEO does so many detrimental things that destroy the brand because bottom line that's what's happening. It's absolutely outrageous his behaviors and the damage he's caused to the brand"" he said.

Walmart did not immediately reply to Business Insider's request for comment which was made outside of normal working hours."

Jordyn Bradley

I worked at Disney World and visited the theme parks for free all the time.

Now that I've returned as a regular paying guest I'm not sure it's worth all the money.

I still had a blast on my vacation but the cost of tickets add-ons food and souvenirs adds up.

If you're looking for a vacation that's a great value I don't think you'll ever find it at Disney World.

As someone who used to work at the parks I still love their childlike whimsy. But I've turned into a more practical (and cynical) guest.

My partner and I recently planned our first Disney trip together and told ourselves we could do it on a budget. But even with all of our efforts the vacation was still extremely expensive.

We tried to cut the base cost down while booking our trip

We went in early September — when the parks are typically a little less crowded and a little cheaper. And we ended up paying just over $100 a night to stay at Disney's All-Star Sports Resort.

By staying on the property we had the perk of free bus transportation to the parks and Disney Springs so we didn't have to pay for a rental car or parking.

As far as the theme parks go we sprung for three-day park-hopper tickets for a little over $500 each intending to visit a couple of parks each day and check off all our must-dos must-rides must-eats and must-meets.

Our days were meticulously planned to get as much done as possible

The parks get crowded as the day goes on so we got there early. Jordyn Bradley

To help with our time constraints we rope-dropped the parks by getting there as early as possible. We also signed up for any virtual queues available for newer rides and made dining reservations for the places we knew we wanted to hit.

Our park days kicked off with high-interest rides and areas like Seven Dwarfs Mine Train in Magic Kingdom and Galaxy's Edge in Hollywood Studios.

This helped us significantly cut down on our wait times because the parks only get more crowded as the days go on.

We tried to avoid ticket add-ons but it was pretty much impossible

We prioritized getting on all our favorite rides which ended up costing us. Jordyn Bradley

We were pretty set on not paying the extra $20 a person per day for Genie+ Lightning Lanes that offer shorter waits. But it was a bit unavoidable if we wanted to get on all our must-do rides.

We had to choose between paying more or missing out and our FOMO got the best of us.

Paying more to be able to ride something when I've already purchased a ticket to the park is frustrating especially since these line-skipping passes used to be free.







When I worked at the parks I could log on to the My Disney Experience App on my days off see what attractions had passes available and be on that ride within the hour.

I'm used to getting discounts all over Disney World

When I worked at Disney World I visited the parks for free and got added discounts. Jordyn Bradley

On top of free park entry when I worked at Disney World I got 20% off select food and beverage locations — and around the holidays 40% off select merchandise.

We also received special holiday coupons for things like free Mickey pretzels ice-cream bars and churros on top of discounted sit-down dining.

With all those savings I constantly bought new $30 Mickey ears. But this time I had to keep my merchandise budget strictly for more affordable things like pins.

Eating and drinking around the world at Epcot was the most cost-efficient thing we did

Of course we wanted to do what most 20-somethings like to do at Disney: Eat and drink around the world showcase at Epcot.

I think the Food and Wine Festival is the best way to try many small plates at a fair price. I also bought discounted Disney gift cards from Sam's Club ahead of the trip to better budget our snacking.

Some of our favorite food items were the beef Wagyu don in the Japan Pavilion and the filet mignon from Canada. At $9.75 each these were some of the higher-priced items at the festival but they were filling.

I preferred eating a few festival plates for dinner over the sit-down meal we had at Liberty Tree Tavern in Magic Kingdom earlier that day. The meal was tasty but the ""all you care to enjoy"" spread cost over $40 a person.

We just couldn't eat enough to justify the price.

I still loved my trip but I do feel like Disney World is too expensive

It will probably be a while before I head back to Disney World. Jordyn Bradley

I've never had a bad day at Disney — it makes me feel like a kid again. But the bottom line is that a trip to the theme parks is too expensive.

Disney will always charge a premium for its theming and I'll still jump at the opportunity to go. But it takes a significant amount of saving up to make the trip worth it.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2Rpc25leXMtaWdlci10YWtlcy1zaG90cy1hdC13b2tlLXdhci1kZXNhbnRpcy1hbmQtbXVza9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Walt Disney CEO Iger calls out Elon Musk Ron DeSantis,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/travel/disneys-iger-takes-shots-at-woke-war-desantis-and-musk on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2Rpc25leXMtaWdlci10YWtlcy1zaG90cy1hdC13b2tlLXdhci1kZXNhbnRpcy1hbmQtbXVza9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1enpmZWVkLmNvbS9hdWRyZXl3b3Jib3lzLzE2LWVhc3Rlci1lZ2dzLWF0LWRpc25leS1wYXJrc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I Can't Believe I Just Noticed These 17 Easter Eggs At Disney Parks,"6.

Discovery Executes Another Historic Content Purge - Inside the Magic,"According to a recent announcement Warner Bros. Discovery has continued its trend of purging content this time removing well over 100 shows from a digital storefront.

Originally synonymous with innovation and classic brands like Looney Tunes Warner Bros. is now more associated with cutting content. After becoming CEO of Warner Bros. when the company merged with Discovery it seems like David Zaslav has gotten the most joy from preventing audiences from enjoying content.

Not only have multiple finished projects been canceled like Batgirl and Scooby-Doo: The Haunted High-Rise but the higher-ups at Warner Bros. Discovery have also removed numerous animated shows from its streaming platform Max and even completely shut down the Cartoon Network studios.

All of this has been done in order to earn the company tax breaks. Still this has infuriated fans around the globe so much so that they were actually able to get one project Coyote Vs. Acme (TBA) to get pitched to other studios. Hopefully we’ll see that in theaters or online soon.

However this hasn’t completely put a stop to the company’s cost-cutting goals as numerous shows and series will be officially removed from a popular digital storefront by the end of the year.

Warner Bros. Discovery Removes An Unbelievable Amount of Shows From Streaming Service

According to an announcement from Sony a massive number of television shows owned by Warner Bros. Discovery are about to be removed entirely from the PlayStation Store. This includes shows like Say Yes To the Dress (2007-present) Cake Boss (2009-2020) Shark Week (1988-present) and Long Island Medium (2011-2019).

However the most surprising part of this news is that it won’t just be removed from the store; it will be deleted from the PlayStation Network completely. That means even if you already purchased the show it will still be deleted from your library.

“As of December 31 2023” reads the announcement “due to our content licensing arrangements with content providers you will no longer be able to watch any of your previously purchased Discovery content and the content will be removed from your video library.”

Naturally this has shocked many people who own a PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 especially if they have already purchased a show or series they love. “I use PS4” said one Reddit user. “But I have bought many seasons of shows such as Dual Survival (2010-2016) that I do not wish to lose. I was actually under the impression since I owned it I wouldn’t ever lose it…”

Unfortunately this is not the case since users only purchased the license for the show and not a copy of the show itself. This means that even though they may have bought it years ago any piece of content can be purged at any time.

If anything this is a massive argument for physical media. Whenever a product is digital there’s no telling when something can be removed or face some error. If you genuinely want to own a film series video game or any other type of media make sure to listen to Christopher Nolan and get it physically.

Discovery CEO says Mass Layoffs Came Because Prior Businesses Weren’t Ready For the Future of Streaming,"Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav on Wednesday took to the stage at the New York Times Dealbook Summit and spoke about his plans to create a profitable “healthy company.”

Like a majority of streaming companies Zaslav said his goal for Warner Bros. Discovery is to achieve profitability and compete with other streamers not to spend the most money. As a result he oversaw the layoff of hundreds of employees.

“Warner Bros. and Time Warner are companies that had never been restructured for the future” Zaslav said.

This comes as AT&T let go of Warner Bros. last year and Discovery leadership took over. AT&T got out of Hollywood and merged those assets with Discovery forming Zaslav’s Warner Bros. Discovery.

Since taking the helm of the company Zaslav’s tenure has been marked by a series of difficult decisions. During the summit Zaslav defended the choices made to get the new company on track financially.

Prior to the merger Zaslav said “Warner was spending $36 billion on content and losing money.” So far Warner Bros. Discovery has paid down $12 billion of its $56 billion debt that it took on to complete the merger according to Yahoo Finance via Fortune (a paywalled publication).

During Zaslav’s stint as CEO Warner Bros. Discovery shelved several completed movies a controversial move that angered some in Hollywood. He also rebranded HBO Max as Max shut down CNN+ within weeks of launching having since launched a CNN Max instead and put its cable sports content on the streaming service. This all happened amid a massive restructuring that eliminated a large number of jobs.

During the summit Zaslav said the first day of the mass layoffs was his “worst day on the job.”

Zaslav said that the rise of streaming services and the companies prior to the merger weren’t “properly organized” for the evolving business landscape.

Over the last few years the streaming industry has faced a series of obstacles like rising inflation rates increasingly budget-conscious customers and the since-resolved Hollywood writers and actors strikes.

A majority of providers are looking for ways to stay afloat during turbulent times like offering promotions bundle deals and striking new partnership agreements but it’s uncertain whether all the services will survive the next few years.

AT&T wasn’t immediately available for comment.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjcmVlbmdlZWsubmV0LzIwMjMvMTIvMDMvYmF0Z2lybC1tb3ZpZS1jYW5jZWwtY291cmFnZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Warner Bros. CEO David Zaslav Says Cancelling 'Batgirl' Took Courage,"Fans and filmmakers everywhere were devastated when Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav made the decision to cancel Batgirl. The DCEU movie would have loosely tied in with the events of Tim Burton’s Batman and Batman Returns bringing back Michael Keaton as an older Bruce Wayne while Leslie Grace would have played Batgirl. Now David Zaslav states that cancelling the film took “courage.”

As noted via Deadline Zaslav attempted to explain the accounting that went into his decision. Since he took over Warner Bros following their merger with Discovery he’s been eagerly restructuring the company. This has includes a number of layoffs and other such decisions that haven’t been popular in the slightest.

Nevertheless Zaslav insists that they’re necessary:

“The accounting piece is really a misnomer” Zaslav said. “If we produce a show a $100-million movie…We’ve spent the $100 million dollars and if we don’t release it. It’s gone. We don’t have any real benefit from it. The question is should we take certain of these movies and open them in the theater and spend another $30 or $40 million to promote them? And Warner Brothers team and HBO made a number of decisions. They were hard. But when I look at the health of our company today we needed to make those decisions. And it took real courage.”

Of course Batgirl was from the only movie cancelled under David Zaslav. A number of other films and television shows were similarly scrapped. This included the animated special Scoob! Holiday Haunt and a Looney Tunes feature film titled Coyote vs Acme. Fortunately the latter is reportedly being shopped around to other studios for distribution.

As such we’ll have to see how these decisions and attempts at cost-cutting work out. Hopefully Warner Bros will find itself at a place where fans and filmmakers can both be happy and eager to see what the studio has to deliver next.

Stay tuned to ScreenGeek for any additional updates regarding Warner Bros. Discovery and their CEO David Zaslav as we have them. Hopefully we won’t have any other films-turned-tax-write-offs to report in the near future."

According to UNESCO the Hyrcanian Forests in the northern provinces of Gilan Mazandaran and Golestan are between 25 and 50 million years old.

The forests contain the most significant natural habitats for in situ conservation of biological diversity including those containing threatened species of outstanding universal value from the perspective of science or conservation.

It also contains superlative natural phenomena or areas of exceptional natural beauty and aesthetic importance.

In July 2019 Hyrcanian Forests was named a UNESCO World Heritage during the 43rd session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee.

Burying waste in the northern provinces of the country due to the proximity to the sea and the existence of many underground rivers and aquifers is almost impossible.

The problem has endangered not only the health of the forests but also the health of the residents living in their surroundings also.

Therefore the Department of Environment in cooperation with two non-governmental organizations has launched two pilot programs for community-based waste management in two villages which have resulted in a 70 percent reduction in landfilling.

Wet waste is turned into compost in a field around the village and dry waste is collected as people hand them and receive goods in return.

Marine waste management

On September 30 a comprehensive marine environment monitoring program for the country was designed said an official with the Department of Environment.

“The program includes both biological and pollution monitoring for the Persian Gulf the Oman Sea as well as the Caspian Sea” ISNA quoted Omid Seddiqi the DOE official as saying.

“The comprehensive program for monitoring the pollution of the Caspian Sea has made further progress and its fund has been provided. It will begin in late autumn with the help of an ocean-going vessel” he explained.

This program will probably start in autumn or early winter in the south of the country with the help of the Persian Gulf probe ship.

Marine plastic pollution impacts

Over 300 million tons of plastic are produced every year. If discarded improperly plastic waste can harm the environment and biodiversity.

At least 14 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean every year. Plastic debris is currently the most abundant type of litter in the ocean.

Most sources of plastic debris found in the ocean are land-based. Plastic pollution is a widespread problem affecting the marine environment.

It threatens ocean health the health of marine species food safety & quality human health and coastal tourism and contributes to climate change.

The most visible impacts of plastic debris are ingestion suffocation and entanglement of hundreds of marine species.

Marine wildlife such as seabirds whales fish and turtles mistake them for prey and die of starvation as their stomachs become filled with plastic. They suffer lacerations infections reduced ability to swim and internal injuries.

Also when marine organisms ingest plastic debris these contaminants between marine species and humans through the consumption of seafood have been identified as a health hazard and research is ongoing.

Mismanagement of waste

Today one of the most important environmental problems in the country is the mismanagement of waste which incurs a loss of 448 trillion rials (nearly $896 m) annually.

Annually more than 61 million tons of various types of waste are produced in Iran according to the DOE an estimated 10 to 17 percent of the total produced waste is recycled. While in developed countries this number reaches up to 70 percent.

In 2021 Iran ranked 17th in terms of waste production according to the World Population Review.

Although there will be pollution as long as there is consumption in any way it can be kept to an acceptable level by considering green options so as not to cause excessive pollution of the environment.

Some 45000 tons of waste are produced in urban areas and 10000 tons in rural areas and the average per capita waste production per person is 760 grams in cities and 485 grams in villages. Some 65 percent of waste is ""wet"" and 35 percent is ""dry"" while 25 percent is processed and the remaining 75 percent without processing is buried directly and only 10 percent is separated at the source.

The average per capita waste produced in Tehran is 320 kg. On the other hand while the per capita waste production in the world is about 110 kilograms per year and the per capita daily production is 250 to 300 grams this figure is 600 grams in Iran and 1200 grams in the north of Tehran.

Every Iranian consumes an average of three plastic bags daily and the average life of each bag is only 12 minutes while it remains in nature for hundreds of years. In addition to this disposable plastic containers plastic tablecloths plastic packaging etc. have been produced in large quantities in the country which has been used a lot due to the change in people’s lifestyles in recent decades and have put double pressure on the environment.

Also the abundance of plastic bags is of great importance in the waste segregation at the source and their recycling. According to global statistics Iran is among the top 20 countries in the world in producing plastic waste. Some 4 million tons of plastic waste are produced annually of which half a million tons are related to plastic bags. In Iran over 1 million tons of plastic bags are produced annually 96 percent of which go directly into the trash.

Considering the high rate of waste produced in the country and its harmful effects on human health and the environment it seems that the revision of waste management is very important. One of the ways that many countries have taken to reduce waste production is ""zero waste"".

""Zero waste"" is a kind of lifestyle in which a person decides to take full responsibility for the waste they produce during the day and night and also tries to bring the production of waste closer to zero.

In the zero-waste lifestyle people try to avoid luxurious life as much as possible at the beginning. In the next step people with this lifestyle try not to produce waste. When the generation of waste is unavoidable people regularly and carefully separate the waste properly.

We humans can never achieve the zero waste goal. It is only the name of a lifestyle but if the conditions of the society and infrastructure are available we can only approach it.

DeKALB – Waste Management of Illinois plans to open its latest renewable natural gas facility in DeKalb by the end of 2024.

The plant will process bio-gas collected from decomposing organic materials according to a news release. The bio-gas is processed for gas pipeline system delivery. The facility will recover and distribute 1 million British thermal units of renewable natural gas per year.

The plant’s renewable natural gas use is expected to avoid 53000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions from displaced fossil fuels.

Waste Management has identified 20 renewable natural gas projects for development including the DeKalb facility. The company plans to spend more than $1 billion on renewable energy projects from 2022 to 2026 according to the release.

Multiple DeKalb-area dignitaries joined Waste Management leaders in August to celebrate the facility’s groundbreaking.

The ceremony was at the DeKalb County Landfill 18370 Somonauk Road DeKalb.

Every year our planet is burdened with billions of tons of solid waste much of which is not managed properly. According to UN-Habitat 40 to 45 per cent of global municipal solid waste generated either ends up uncollected or managed in uncontrolled facilities such as open dumpsites. Up to 40 per cent of this waste is openly burned and responsible for a staggering five per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. This uncontrolled burning also contaminates the water we drink and the soil in which we grow our food.

In addition the waste management sector is also highly vulnerable to criminal activities due to its scale the high cost of disposal and the complexity of its regulations. By undercutting the costs of proper waste management and through collusion with corrupt officials criminal groups smuggle plastic and solid waste across borders dispose of waste illegally and further contaminate ecosystems.

According to the UN Environment Programme’s (UNEP) Global Waste Management Outlook the prevention and recovery of waste has positive consequences for emissions in all sectors of the economy.

The urgent need for action in this area was recognized by countries in 2022 when the Presidency of the 27th United Nations Climate Change Conference launched a global initiative “50 by 2050” to treat and recycle at least 50 per cent of the solid waste produced in Africa by 2050. With over 180 countries involved this initiative marked a significant step toward a cleaner greener future for our planet.

Yet only 13 per cent of climate commitments target the waste sector in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Efforts in waste reduction reuse recycling and energy recovery are key to creating a low carbon and circular society with sustainable consumption and production. In addition controlling transboundary movements of hazardous and other waste and its illegal trafficking are important means to help countries meet commitments.

Our work

Clear and effective legal provisions and requirements are critical to the success of any compliance and enforcement programme. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) assists Member States to understand prevent detect investigate disrupt and prosecute crimes in the waste sector.

Since 2018 countries in Southeast Asia – including Indonesia Malaysia Thailand and Viet Nam – have become the top regional destinations for the inflow of both legal and illegal waste. Despite existing national and international legal frameworks the existence of waste trade bans and the restrictions put in place by regional governments in recent years problematic waste is still reaching these countries.

Referring to a recent case of e-waste found in warehouses and landfills in Thailand Mr. Teerat Limpayaraya Public Prosecutor in Thailand’s Attorney General’s Office said""only security guards and a warehouse owner were prosecuted with a very small punishment. And waste disposal has become a burden to local government and communities.""

Funded by the European Union and implemented by UNODC the UN Institute for Training and Research and UNEP the Unwaste project aims to promote regional cooperation and policy dialogues to better understand the flows of illicit waste between Europe and Southeast Asia.

In addition through the Passenger and Cargo Control Programme UNODC is building the capacity of customs and law enforcement authorities in Southeast Asia to target plastic and hazardous waste trafficking in containers. Over 84000 tons of plastic and other hazardous waste have been seized or identified during the course of this project. Of this some 50000 tons of dumped hazardous waste have been identified in abandoned containers.

UNODC has also developed a legislative guide on combating waste trafficking to support states to enact or strengthen domestic legislation against this practice. UNODC will also soon release a legislative guide on combatting pollution crime as well as a Global Strategy on Waste.

Side event at COP28

At COP28 UNODC and partners held a side event on 3 December in the Waste and Resources pavilion on international regulations and national policies driving waste management and circularity.

“The lack of environmental legislation and enforcement coupled with financial disparities between countries drives illegal trafficking of waste – and waste trafficking is a very big business” said UNODC Executive Director Ghada Waly at the event. Ms. Waly highlighted UNODC’s efforts assisting Member States to address the illegal trafficking of waste as a climate mitigation strategy and integrate the justice system’s response to waste crime into circular economy agendas.

The side event was organized through a partnership between the UN Human Settlements Programme (UN Habitat) the Secretariat of the Basel Rotterdam and Stockholm (BRS Secretariat) along with the ASEAN Secretariat Nokia the French Agency for Ecological Transition and the International Solid Waste Association.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZhaXJwbGFuZXQub3JnL2VkaXRvcnMtcGljay9pbmRpYS13YXN0ZS1wcm9ibGVtL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What do we do with India’s mounting waste problem?,"December 02 2023 What do we do with India's mounting waste problem? topic: Pollution located: India editor: Bindu Gopal Rao

India is facing a serious issue as it grapples with finding a solution to waste management. The country's population generates 62 million tonnes of waste annually. Only 70% is collected and 12 million tonnes are treated. Unfortunately 31 million tonnes still end up in landfills. Solid municipal waste is expected to rise to 165 million tonnes by 2030. The numbers indeed indicate that this is a huge issue to tackle.

The Union Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change controls waste management in India and related laws are framed according to the Environment Protection Act of 1986.

Rapid urbanisation is one of the primary reasons for the surge in solid waste production. As more and more people move from rural to urban areas India's cities are becoming overloaded with people leading to a steady rise in population and waste generation.

Waste disposal is a problem as cities lack adequate garbage collection infrastructure. Though waste segregation is mandated in several states only about 30% of waste is sorted correctly meaning plastic ends up in landfills instead of being recycled.

Yet many solutions to the waste management problem are hiding in plain sight. A white paper presented at a two-day waste management workshop earlier this year indicated that the waste in India could produce up to 65 GW of electricity per annum. This figure could grow to 165 GW by 2030 and 436 GW by 2050.

While local bodies and corporation offices oversee waste collection one line of thought advocates a decentralised waste management model looking at privatising garbage collection and another involves local communities taking charge of waste treatment and promoting recycling.

While technology can help especially RFID-enabled monitoring and GPS tracking for efficient waste management strict implementation of waste management rules will ensure that severe penalties are levied for noncompliance.

An aggressive public awareness program to educate people through community and self-help groups about segregation composting and recycling waste could also make a big difference.

He’s not exactly wrong.

The company’s first feature Sattar smashed Saudi box office records at the start of the year becoming the most successful local feature of all time in the space of a couple of weeks and would go on to beat most major Hollywood releases (including Barbie). Less than 12 months on at the Red Sea Film Festival in Jeddah it currently has two of buzziest titles screening in Naga and Mandoob both of which premiered in Toronto. Screenings for the films were among the first to sell out.

Suspense thriller Naga — part of a multi-picture deal Telfaz11 signed with Netflix — comes from writer/director Meshal Aljaser and tells the story of a girl whose efforts to sneak out for a secret date spiral out of control. Mandoob meanwhile is a darker comedy set in Riyadh following a delivery man who unwittingly gets caught up in the city’s more illicit underbelly.

Despite being a prolific creative for many years Mandoob also marks the first feature directed by Kalthami who says he’s been biding his time helping produce other Telfaz features from its roster of directors while quietly developing the project in the background.

“I’m glad I did it that way — it made me wiser so I could learn from my mistakes and see the position of the market” he explains from the Red Sea Festival ahead of Mandoob’s local premiere on Sunday Dec. 3.

It’s a strategy Telfaz11 has perfected from the beginning that of carefully analyzing the cinematic landscape before racing to rush out films (despite being one of the more established companies when cinemas reopened in 2018 its first release didn’t come until 5 years later).

And Kalthami explains Mandoob marks part of the next stage of the company’s strategy to “unlock a new potential” for a still young market with an as-yet-untested genre.

Up until now Telfaz11 has been known — and celebrated — for its comedies (it made its name making comedy sketch shows for YouTube) and most Arabic language releases have stuck to humor. But Mandoob breaks away from that mold with something darker.

“I’m hoping that we open up a new demographic and that people who were perhaps losing the faith that genre wasn’t being catered for find something in this” he says. “We want to be a studio for filmmakers who want to tell a story that could be out of the norm. We want to break the norm and surpass it — we want to be known as a studio that does genres and isn’t stuck to one thing.”

Mandoob is also part of an effort to position Telfaz11 internationally to get recognition from film festivals such as Toronto and see their films travel the globe. While Netflix is releasing Naga Mandoob is being shopped by MPM Premium with THR understanding some territories have already been snapped up (in Saudi it’s being released by Front Row Arabia which helped land Sattar record-breaking results).

As a Saudi who has watched the dramatic changes in his country over the last few years Mandoob is also something personal for Kalthami set in the present day in his home city of Riyadh.

“We go to the cinema all the time and watch films that show places and behaviors and belief systems in stories that reflect the time that the film was shot and I guess that’s what I was thinking about while making this” he says. “I know for a fact that Saudi will shift completely in the next 10 years. So the film becomes a reference point. I’m not saying that Mandoob is a document of reality it’s a reference to reality and drawn from reality.”

The reaction to Mandoob in Toronto — its first contact with the public — far exceeded what Kalthami expected especially for a local film. He recalls looking back at the audience and seeing a sea of “white faces and blonde hair” and thinking “Oh my god this is not remotely us — are they going to know what the story is about?”

But they did.

“They got the humor they got the sarcasm they understood the character they got the true essence of the genre” he says adding that there was also a “huge interest” from people in seeing a Saudi film possibly for the very first time (and a story that many might not expect to come from the country). By the time of the second screening at TIFF word had gotten out and a younger audience came some of whom Kalthami says had lived in Saudi in their childhood and noticed things in the film he never thought anyone outside the country would spot.

“It was to control expectations or even guide expectations” he says. “I was afraid maybe it’s a genre that people wouldn’t be interested in but it’s been the opposite. That’s the reaction we’ve had from people. It’s like thank you we’ve been waiting for something like this.

Maxine Waters asks PNC Wells to put bank branches in her district,"Representative Maxine Waters a Democrat from California held a town hall meeting on Saturday at Inglewood High School where she pointedly asked executives from City National Bank PNC Financial Services and Wells Fargo & Co. if they would each open a branch in her district.

LOS ANGELES – Rep. Maxine Waters held a town hall meeting on Saturday where she pointedly asked executives from City National Bank PNC Financial Services and Wells Fargo & Co. if they would each open a branch in her district. She said she wanted to hold the banks accountable for promises made in recent merger agreements or consent orders.

The town hall meeting at Inglewood High School got fiery at times as Waters pressed the three bank executives to answer questions from constituents in her 43rd congressional district in South Los Angeles. Waters the ranking member of the House Financial Services Committee said she invited all the top banks to attend but was turned down by Bank of America Citigroup JPMorgan Chase and U.S. Bancorp.

Next week the Senate Banking Committee plans to hold an annual oversight hearing with executives from the nation's top banks. Waters said she was disappointed that Republicans in the House would not hold a similar hearing. Her town hall she said would try to fill in the gap.

When Jeffrey Martinez executive vice president and head of branch banking at PNC Bank described how the Pittsburgh bank was upholding its pledge to invest an eye-popping $88 billion in local communities over four years as part of its 2020 acquisition of BBVA  Waters asked specifically if PNC was coming to her neighborhood.

""When are you going to open up a branch in my district?"" Waters said. ""We have a problem with branch banking not being available to us in all of our communities in the way they should be. We call them banking deserts.""

Martinez responded: ""That's a great question it's an important one and one of the things we've slated even though we're new to California.""

""We would like to help you find a location"" Waters said to thunderous applause and laughter from the crowd of about 300. ""I'm so looking forward to establishing"" a branch here she added.

Waters then described how City National Bank in Los Angeles had agreed in January to pay $31 million to settle redlining allegations brought by the Justice Department. As part of the agreement City National has promised to open one branch in a majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhood in L.A. County.

""Can you discuss where you might be opening the branch?"" Waters asked. ""Where are you with all of this?""

David Cameron City National's executive vice president of personal and business banking responded ""That is a great question"" drawing laughter from the audience.

""I don't have any announcement on where we're going to put that branch.""

To which Waters replied: ""Oh we'll help you"" to further applause from the audience.

City National plans ""to go above and beyond"" the agreement to invest at least $29.5 million in a loan subsidy fund for residents of majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in Los Angeles County Cameron said. The bank has hired more than 20 loan officers to support the initiative to provide grants of up to $15000 each to first-time homebuyers.

Waters also questioned why City National did not have a mortgage loan officer at a local branch on Crenshaw Boulevard in Los Angeles.

""You've done well at that branch are you going to expand that branch and put a loan officer there?"" Waters said. ""Can you do these things?""

Waters skillfully thanked each of the bankers for showing up to the town hall meeting while also hitting them hard on consent orders.

""I really thank you for coming today. I know that you know we have a lot of questions for you based on the fines that you received and all of that"" she told Cameron and then asked the audience to give him a round of applause.

She also asked Colleen Canny Wells Fargo's executive vice president and national head of branch banking why the San Francisco bank has been closing so many branches  which Waters estimated at 2000 branch closings over many years. She cited the Wells Fargo 2016 fake accounts scandal that led the Federal Reserve to impose an asset cap on the bank.

""First tell us why did you close those branches?"" Waters asked.

Canny said that customer transactions through branches have fallen 50% over the past three years as more banking is done online through mobile apps or ATMs.

""We still think branches are important and we continue to look at our branch footprint to ensure we have the proper coverage"" Canny said.

Waters lamented that banks are closing branches in inner cities where seniors who may not necessarily use a cell phone to bank still prefer to go to a branch in person.

""I want to tell you something that is a cultural discovery for everybody"" Waters told the bankers and the audience. ""We like to go to a teller as we put our money across the counter. We like this kind of interaction with the people that we do service with and this is the kind of cultural consideration that the bank should take into account.""

At the town hall which lasted for four hours constituents asked a wide range of questions including why there were long lines at their local branches and why they were not able to get small business loans or even speak directly to the same banker on each visit. CFPB Director Rohit Chopra who spoke after the bankers answered a range of questions on reverse mortgages digital redlining and junk fees.

Waters also lambasted the banking industry generally for Republican-led efforts in the House which voted on Friday to nullify the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's small-business data-collection rule . Despite the bill's passage in a 221-202 vote President Joe Biden has vowed to veto the bill and uphold the rule.

The head organizer for Rise Economy the consumer group formerly known as the California Community Reinvestment Coalition asked the bankers generally why they did not support the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

""Your industry trade groups are attacking the CFPB they're attacking fundamental consumer protections … and very basic data on small business lending that we fought hard for for nearly 10 years"" said Jyotswaroop Kaur Bawa chief of organizing and campaigns at Rise Economy. ""We want you to tell us specifically how many Black and Hispanic-owned businesses you make loans to and at what rate—that's what the fight is about.""

Politics and policy House votes to nullify CFPB small-business data rule Republicans and a handful of Democrats in the House and Senate which already had passed an identical bill say the data-collection rule would be too onerous for lenders and small-business borrowers. President Biden is expected to veto the legislation. December 1

The small-business lending rule is expected to be used by the CFPB to identify discrimination though the bureau exempted more than 2000 community banks and small businesses from the rule. The coalition sued the CFPB in 2019 for taking so long to issue the rule which Dodd-Frank's Section 1071 mandated.

The 1071 rule was about wealth-building and closing the wealth gap Waters said.

""The Senate Republicans put up a great fight against getting the rule the data that we needed to determine why we can't get small business loans — they fought us very hard and they said they represented the banks"" Waters said. ""Republicans won on trying to kill that rule that would give us information that would show that Blacks Latinos women and LGBTQ would not be getting small business [loans.]""

Water did commend one bank: First Citizens BancShares which acquired the failed Silicon Valley Bank and last month announced an agreement to invest more than $6.5 billion in California and Massachusetts communities through an updated community benefits plan. The agreement Waters said paved the way for a branch to be opened in Watts.

Waters characteristically played to the audience by rattling off the various programs created after the pandemic including loans that banks delivered via the Paycheck Protection Program.

""You're wondering if there's all this money around why haven't we been able to get some of it"" Waters said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vdGhlYXZpYXRpb25pc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMDMvcC04LWV4dHJhY3Rpb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New Photos Show P-8A Being Prepared For Extraction From The Waters Of Kaneohe Bay,"The Navy currently estimates the cost of the salvage operation to be about $1.5 million.

A complex operation to recover the P-8A Poseidon that ended in water after overshooting the runway during landing at Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay Hawaii is currently underway. The P-8A 169561 YD-561 belonging to the VP-4 “Skinny Dragons” based at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island Washington came to rest around 50ft offshore sitting on its nose and main landing gear on coral while also maintaining most of its buoyancy.

The P-8A crew assigned to Whidbey Island Washington-based Patrol Squadron (VP) 4 “Skinny Dragons” was on a detachment in support of maritime homeland defense. There were nine crewmembers on board – three pilots and six crewmembers (two officer and four enlisted). All crewmembers safely evacuated the aircraft and no injuries were reported.

According to the U.S. Navy the recovery effort commenced on Dec. 2 2023 and involved a multidisciplinary team of military and civilian experts. The operation began at 6:30 AM LT and the aircraft was floating on top of the roller bags by 8:30 a.m.

“The conditions have been ideal and the operation is progressing exactly as planned” said Rear Adm. Kevin P. Lenox the salvage operation’s on-scene commander in a press release. “This morning we floated the aircraft and moved it towards land. As of early afternoon we have begun the stage where we pull the aircraft out of the water and onto the runway. Throughout the process divers in the water have maintained close observation of the aircraft to ensure no further contact with coral or the sea bottom.”

The Navy currently estimates the cost of the salvage operation to be about $1.5 million. Once extracted the aircraft will be inspected and monitored until it is towed to a wash rack where it will be cleaned with fresh water to begin the process of reclaiming and repairing the aircraft. While the airframe seems to be largely intact it’s not clear whether it can return to service.

ALAMOSA — The Colorado Pacific Rio Grande Railroad has recently repainted 10 locomotives that now adorn the engines with a motif that includes the company logo which includes a graphic comprised of mountains water and farmland that includes grains.

According to Matt Prince with the railroad it has purchased 10 of the locomotives from BNSF Railway. Prince added the locomotives are SD-70 MAC's. The paint job also includes the name of the railroad owner Stefan Soloviev.

The SD-70 MAC's were built by the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors in 2002. Many of the locomotives produced by GM were bought by BNSF and 28 were bought by the Alaska Railroad. According to that railroad the SD-MAC name is comprised of SD which refers to Special Duty and MAC translates to M for modified cab and AC for Alternating Current traction motors.

Between 1993 and 2003 over 1500 locomotives were built for five railroads across North America. The Alaska Railroad terms the locomotives as the ""backbone"" of daily train operations. Founded in 1922 the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors had a long and storied history in the production of these workhorses. In 2005 the business was sold to Greenbrier Equity and Berkshire Partners. In 2010 the business was bought by Progress Rail a division of Caterpillar Inc.

The Colorado Pacific Rio Grande is a 150-mile line that serves Alamosa Huerfano Costilla Conejos and Rio Grande counties with 12 stations along its route. In Alamosa the line splits with one branch extending south to Antonito and the other continuing northeast to South Fork. The railroad was bought last in bankruptcy proceedings by Soloviev of New York.

According to Prince several of the locomotives will go to the Colorado Pacific Railroad in Eads which is also owned by Soloviev.

""The locomotives are definitely an upgrade for us"" said Prince.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdXJiYW5taWx3YXVrZWUuY29tLzIwMjMvMTIvMDMvcGxhdHMtYW5kLXBhcmNlbHMtZGVhbC1wcmV2ZW50cy1pcm9uLWhvcnNlLWhvdGVsLWZvcmVjbG9zdXJlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Plats and Parcels: Deal Prevents Iron Horse Hotel Foreclosure,"Plus: Trouble for downtown hotels. And a recap of the week's real estate news.

Get a daily rundown of the top stories on Urban Milwaukee

Real estate developer Tim Dixon will keep control of The Iron Horse Hotel after all.

Dixon successfully navigated a 2021 foreclosure case and a 2022 Chapter 11 bankruptcy case filed in part to slow the foreclosure to allow his firm to continue to own the Walker’s Point hotel.

The 100-room boutique hotel 500 W. Florida St. has been regarded as one of the city’s premier hotels since it opened in 2008. It’s drawn special attention for its public-facing bars and restaurants and its support for guests with motorcycles.

Just a few months ago the hotel seemed like it would soon have a new owner. It was marketed for sale and an auction was scheduled. But while this was playing out Dixon was negotiating with GS Mortgage Securities Corporation II an entity created by Goldman Sachs to hold investments in several mortgages and the loan’s servicer Rialto Capital.

The auction was ultimately canceled according to Delaware bankruptcy court documents because broker JLL didn’t find a buyer willing to pay more than the $24 million owed on the secured loan.

Now a revised loan agreement would create a more sustainable operation for the hotel and Dixon’s ownership of it.

“The Debtor simply cannot sustain its operations at this juncture without the cooperation and assistance of [the lender] and the Debtor’s path forward depends upon [the lender]’s cooperation and its agreement with the treatment of its secured claim” wrote Dixon of the need for a new agreement.

The business owner also said the legal entanglement had impacted the hotel’s staff.

“Tasks related to the Chapter 11 case and the sale process have also impacted morale and imposed additional burdens on the Debtor’s management and staff at a time when as reflected in the Budget margins are thin and attention is needed to drive business to the hotel. I therefore believe it is in the best interests of the estate for hotel operations to continue without disruptions that may be caused by a transition of ownership or by continuation of the Chapter 11 case” wrote Dixon.

Earlier this month Dixon invested $100000 in Rider Hotel LLC the hotel’s legal entity of which he is the majority investor to address a cash flow shortfall. Terms of the larger settlement require Rider Hotel to pay its lender approximately $4.9 million to reinstate the loan in good standing. That must be done by the end of the year to avoid default. Rider Hotel must also engage in “certain cash management protocols.” Specific details on the reinstatement agreement are unavailable because the agreement was filed under seal.

According to a court document Rider Hotel anticipates owing more than $756000 in administrative fees to resolve the Chapter 11 case. “Cash flow is tight” says the settlement motion but the entity is expected to be able to pay all of the costs if relief is granted by the lender.

An income statement submitted as part of the bankruptcy case shows Rider Hotel lost $446584 in October the last month available but turned a gross operating profit of $66889 on $684172 in revenue.

The Iron Horse isn’t the only Milwaukee hotel to face financial difficulties. A sheriff’s sale is scheduled to resolve a foreclosure of the Cambria Hotel in Westown. Two other downtown hotels have recently endured foreclosure actions. In July the 138-room Hampton Inn & Suites 176 W. Wisconsin Ave. was transferred to its lender in lieu of foreclosure. A Fairfield Inn & Suites was sold in a 2022 sheriff’s sale.

Demolition Underway On Walker’s Point Seed Warehouse

An 11-story 150000-square-foot building once described as “one of the strongest and heaviest concrete structures in the country” will soon be no more. Demolition work is underway on the wedge-shaped Courteen Seed Company warehouse at 222 W. Freshwater Way. New Berlin Grading is razing the building on behalf of a company affiliated with Rite-Hite Holding Corporation which has its new corporate headquarters to the west. A raze permit lists the estimated cost at $1.5 million. “[The company] looked at multiple options to renovate and/or repurpose the building but after many years of vacancy expert engineering studies report that the building structure has deteriorated beyond repair” said a spokesperson for SixSibs Capital in a statement in September. “Ownership intends to save or recycle materials and objects found within the building for future use. Development plans for the property are in the early stages with nothing definitive to share at this time.”

21 Construction Companies in State Violated Prevailing Wage Laws

More than 140 construction workers will receive back pay following a federal investigation into wages paid on a housing development in Oconomowoc. According to a statement from the U.S. Department of Labor 21 construction companies violated prevailing wage laws while working on a federally-assisted 302-unit apartment complex in the Pabst Farms development in Waukesha County. The department’s Wage and Hour Division investigated the development which is insured by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and is subject to the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts. That law requires that workers on federally assisted construction projects are paid no less than the prevailing local wage. Through the investigation the department found that 142 workers were shortchanged in hourly and overtime wages by more than $1.2 million.

County Awarded Federal Funding For Affordable Housing

Milwaukee County’s Housing Division was awarded $1.8 million in federal funding for affordable housing programs. The funding comes from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and a new grant program called Housing Mobility Services. Officials from the county and HUD gathered at an affordable housing development in Brown Deer to announce the $25 million in grant awards that went to seven housing agencies across the nation. The program provides funding for housing agencies to expand housing mobility programs that help families using Section 8 housing vouchers move to neighborhoods with high-performing schools jobs low crime rates and other amenities. The grants were made for agencies that have “expressed an ability to house families through the voucher program but also help families move to areas of higher opportunity” said Robert J. Monocchio HUD Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. The funds can be used to help defray the cost of moving and to assist families in finding housing in new areas. These programs are aimed at supporting families with children.

Developer Plans To Save Long-Vacant Building

A state grant would advance the redevelopment of a long-vacant four-story building on Milwaukee’s Near West Side. Developer Jason Waters through his Watersview Investments Group is pursuing redevelopment of the building 2627-2631 W. State St. into six apartments and two first-floor commercial spaces. Plans call for marketing the commercial space to tenants interested in starting a cafe or opening a fitness training operation. First built in 1913 the 10064-square-foot building has been vacant for more than 20 years. But Waters is proposing a $1.1 million investment to renovate the property. According to a pending resolution Milwaukee County would serve as a sponsor for Waters to receive a $250000 grant from the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation (WEC). The county would not provide or serve as a pass-through for any of the funding. Watersview would be required to provide a 75% match to access the grant.

Or follow us on Google News

Carbon dioxide reaches a liquid state when compressed and it expands with a pop when released and now the Italian startup Energy Dome is ready to harness the action for a new energy storage system that could provide far more storage at far less cost than conventional lithium-ion battery arrays. Energy Dome’s first project is getting under way in Italy with completion expected before the end of next year. A second project is already in the pipeline for the US state of Wisconsin too.

CO2 For Long Duration Energy Storage

With the climate crisis looming overhead long duration energy storage systems have been described as the key to unlocking vast reserves of intermittent wind and solar energy at a more rapid pace.

Lithium-ion battery arrays are currently the go-to medium for storing excess wind and solar energy. However the state of battery technology typically allows for about 4-6 hours of storage with newer systems topping out at eight hours. That’s enough to accomplish daily grid management tasks but the work will pile up as higher volumes of renewable energy flow into grid systems. For future grid resiliency energy planners are seeking a minimum of 10 hours in storage capacity ideally reaching a full day or much longer.

The idea of using liquid CO2 for energy storage is simple enough now that low cost renewable energy is at hand. During periods when renewable energy output is high but electricity demand is low grid managers have to order curtailments in wind or solar capacity. With a CO2 storage system the excess kilowatts can be put to work running compressors that convert a large volume of CO2 gas to a smaller volume of liquid. When released from compression and heated the CO2 expands back to a gas and is put to work running turbines to generate electricity.

Energy Dome crossed the CleanTechnica radar last year with a new “CO2 Battery” storage system. The company earned a place in BNEF Pioneers program of the influential Bloomberg NEF energy research organization based on its potential for achieving long duration energy storage of up to 24 hours. The system is relatively simple deploying expandable bladders as a storage platform.

“To ice the long duration energy storage cake Energy Dome claims that its system is based on proven technologies with non-flammable non-toxic materials and that it maintains its performance level for 25 years and possibly longer” we noted.

A New CO2 Storage System For Italy

In the latest development on Friday Energy Dome announced that it has gained project-level funding to begin work on its first “thermo-mechanical energy storage system” in the municipality of Otttana in the Sardinian province of Nuoro. The euros are coming from Breakthrough Energy Catalyst (up to €35000000) and the European Investment Bank (€25000000 via Invest EU) through a partnership between Breakthrough and the EU.

“This combined investment is an endorsement of Energy Dome’s ready-to-be-deployed long-duration energy storage proposition. Energy Dome’s robust performance (high round-trip efficiency) and capital expenditure requirements are significantly more competitive than the Lithium-Ion benchmark providing a solution to the critical problem of utility-scale long-duration energy storage which is at the core of the renewable energy transition” Energy Dome states.

The Sardinia project will consist of the company’s standardized 20-megawatt 200 megawatt-hour CO2 Battery. It meets the 10-hour long duration milestone described by the US Department of Energy among others.

“The CO2 Battery does not use materials from rare metals and its main components are based on already existing and known supply chains enabling job creation within Europe” Energy Dome adds.

$30 Million For Long Duration Energy Storage In Wisconsin

Commercial operation is expected by Q3 2024 for Energy Dome’s project in Italy. Meanwhile energy planners in Wisconsin are eagerly awaiting their own 20-megawatt CO2 Battery under the forthcoming Columbia Energy Storage Project. The plan is to submit project details to state regulators next year with an eye on beginning construction in 2025 at a site in the Town of Portage.

The project will be up and running in 2026 if all goes according to plan. That may have been a somewhat dicey proposition some years ago when Wisconsin had a rocky relationship with renewable energy in general and wind power in particular. More recently though the momentum has gone to the clean tech side.

In fact Wisconsin stakeholders are anticipating that the new storage system will serve as a model for replication all around the US and some heavy hitters are involved.

The lead US stakeholder behind the CO2 Battery project is the Wisconsin public utility Alliant Energy which received a grant of up to $30 million from the US Department of Energy for the Columbia project. In addition to funding from the Energy Department partners in the project include WEC Energy Group Madison Gas and Electric Shell Global Solutions US the California-based Electric Power Research Institute University of Wisconsin-Madison and Madison College.

“Guided by our purpose-driven strategy we continue to invest in cost-effective sustainable energy solutions for the customers and communities we proudly serve” enthused John Larsen Alliant CEO and board chair. “As we diversify our energy mix the added capacity and unique capabilities of energy storage solutions will strengthen our generation portfolio increase grid resilience improve reliability and help us continue to meet customer needs.”

More Long Duration Energy Storage For The USA

As another indication that the Wisconsin project is anticipated to be the first of many it was funded through the Energy Department’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations which launched in 2021 with a $25 billion mandate from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to “help scale the emerging technologies needed to tackle our most pressing climate challenges and achieve net zero emissions by 2050.”

OCED has set a high bar for the projects in its long duration energy storage portfolio. In addition to scooping more wind and solar energy into the grid long duration projects are expected to improve critical infrastructure emergency response grid stability and management systems and transmission systems with a particular focus on rural areas including communities where energy costs are high.

Long duration energy storage is also expected to help defer or outright avoid new costs associated with transformers substations and other transmission and distribution infrastructure. Providing for EV fast-charging stations is another priority among other tasks.

On top of all that projects that qualify for OCED funding have to submit a community benefits plan. OCED lists community and workforce engagement workforce investment energy and environmental justice and diversity equity inclusion and accessibility among the elements of a qualifying project.

The Columbia project “builds on an ongoing partnership between Alliant Energy Columbia County and the Ho-Chunk Nation by supporting their shared goals of advancing sustainable energy solutions and expanding economic opportunities” OCED explained in a funding announcement issued in September.

Developed by Related Companies the project involves the conversion of three stories of retail space in 20 Hudson Yards into 445000 square feet of new office space providing an easy link to the company’s existing nine-story footprint in the connecting 30 Hudson Yards supertall skyscraper. Wells Fargo reportedly purchased the former Neiman Marcus store which closed in 2020 for $550 million and plans to open the new office in three years.

This redevelopment will transform the vacant space into a modern advanced office environment. Around 2300 employees from Wells Fargo’s current office at 150 East 42nd Street are expected to relocate to Hudson Yards starting in late 2026 joining their colleagues already based there.

The planned office space will feature collaborative workspaces amenities such as a food hall with a rotating local restaurant program and an all-day coffee bar offering views of Hudson Yards’ landmarks. The company will also have a dedicated entrance on Tenth Avenue and naming rights for the exterior of the property.

“This significant expansion demonstrates both the success of Hudson Yard’s modern lifestyle offices and live work play environment as well as the power of New York City to meet the evolving needs of the world’s most innovative companies” said Jeff T. Blau CEO of Related Companies. “New York City is once again a magnet for the best talent and industry leaders like Wells Fargo recognize the long-term advantage of having dynamic office space at Hudson Yards.”

But the largest was one we didn’t see coming: a 445000 square-foot expansion by Wells Fargo at Related Companies’ 20 Hudson Yards that swallowed up all of the former Neiman Marcus floors as well as adjacent space.

When pandemic-cursed Neiman Marcus closed its seven-floor emporium in the 20 Hudson Yards mall in July 2020 just eighteen months after it opened more than a few “experts” proclaimed that it signified the failure of Related chairman Stephen M. Ross’s entire $25 billion vision for the Far West Side.

AdWeek snorted “Neiman Marcus’ Hudson Yards Exit Is a Failure for the Entire Development.” The New York Times fretted “How Will Hudson Yards Survive the Pandemic?”

But Ross and partner Oxford Property Group have the last laugh.

Wells Fargo’s expansion which the bank announced last week isn’t a lease but a purchase which CoStar valued at $550 million.

It gives the bank a total of 950000 square feet in the complex where it bought nine floors at adjoining 30 Hudson Yards in 2015 CoStar said.

Wells Fargo has 950000 square feet in the Hudson Yards complex. Helayne Seidman

Some 95 percent of the complex’s 8.8 million square feet of expensive offices are either leased or owned by marquee-name users such as BlackRock Facebook Tapestry Boies Schiller Flexner and Point72 Asset Management.

The towers’ seventy-plus percent physical occupancy is among the highest in the city.

Now if only Related can figure out a way to reopen the Vessel which closed after a fourth troubled person jumped to his death from it last year.

Ross and Co. are geniuses at design.

Surely there’s a common-sense solution — like higher glass walls for instance?"

The global population was approximately 4.7 billion1 (half of what it is today) and Space Shuttle missions were starting to take astronauts to orbit regularly. The US military’s ARPANET was officially switching to use the Internet Protocol marking the birth of the Internet.

While the first issue of Powder & Bulk Solids in 1983 may not have made the national headlines it was the start of an important role the publication plays in a field that touches so many parts of our daily lives. Bulk solids science has advanced significantly over the past half a century and yet there is much more to explore and develop as we discuss below.

Industry Challenges Through Four Decades

Pre-1980s Challenges

Though bulk solids handling science had been in development since Andrew Jenike’s work in the 1950s it was at its infancy and old design habits persisted. Engineers designing bulk solids handling equipment using T-squares and triangles found 60° to be a convenient hopper angle for bins and silos. Furthermore pyramidal-shaped hoppers--with four flat walls welded together--provided a low-cost easy-to-fabricate solution which unfortunately yielded the least reliable flow behavior. A lack of Computer Aided Design (CAD) and three-dimensional modeling contributed to design errors with storage and conveying systems causing major process inefficiencies safety concerns and product quality issues.

Engineers throughout the world are trained on the behaviors of solids liquids and gases. However education on bulk solids handling during this period was nearly nonexistent. Only a handful of universities had any faculty with expertise or industrial experience with bulk solids. Even major engineering societies such as AIChE or ASME had educational blind spots in this important technology area.

Though Andrew Jenike’s foundational first-principles theory of the flow of bulk solids was published in the 1960s its effective adoption in industries such as foods plastics metals and pharmaceuticals was slow. Additionally distribution of educational content on bulk solids handling was limited to only a handful of industry publications and conferences with minimal world-wide participation.

80s and 90s Challenges

These decades are considered major inflection points in the information age. Though 75% of the 80s and 90s did not have email or internet major advances occurred with computers electronics instrumentation and controls. Facilities handling bulk solids such as grains ores fossil fuels and plastics were expected to manufacture products faster and safer. Often in-company subject matter experts were available to guide others including engineers avoiding costly mistakes learned during their decades of experience. Workers commonly stayed employed at companies for many years as loyalty prevailed and opportunities for growth existed accompanied by valuable experience.

As the global economies expanded in these decades the need for increased factory throughput drove automation and increased process scaling. Automating and scaling-up handling systems require bulk solids handling expertise. While many engineers study liquids and gases in their formal education they lack understanding of bulk solids. Utilizing liquid and gas scale-up methods for solids proved to be detrimental. For instance as coal production increased to meet electricity needs larger coal storage bunkers and stockpiles were needed at power plants. Though storage capacities increased so did bunker and pile fires caused by spontaneous combustion of stagnant coal. Flow reliability decreased due to increased bridging and ratholing in bunkers and stockpiles.

Production quality improvements driven by Statistical Process Control (SPC) and Six Sigma initiatives were pervasive in these decades. In situations involving bulk solids handling poor and/or erratic flow negatively affected the overall results of SPC given out-of-control processes are difficult to fine tune. Even increased automation of processes struggled where solids were subject to caking segregation or flow rate limitations all of which are common material handling challenges in food chemical and pharmaceutical industries.

In the early 1980s the US Department of Energy commissioned the RAND Corp. to investigate the performance of 37 US- and Canada-based processing plants. The study reviewed how solids liquids and gases were processed during feed intermediate and final product conditions.

Key findings from the Rand study2 follow:



Facilities handling bulk solids performed worse than those handling liquids or gases only.

Two-thirds of the plants handling bulk solids operated at less than 80% of their nameplate capacity at the end of their first year with a quarter failing to reach even 40%. The average for this group was 64% of nameplate compared to more than 90% for liquidgas operations.

“By far the most common problems resulted from the tendency of solids to plug stick flow unevenly and go where they should not (often in the form of dust).” 3

The major root causes of these failures were lack of knowledge around heat and material balances particularly with the flow of bulk solids.

Only 6% of the 37 plants studied had no major performance issues and most problems involved were related to bulk solids behavior and not chemistry.

When compared to facilities built in the 1960s (20 years prior) there was no difference (i.e. signs of improvement). The improvement effort during that period was found to be focused on process chemistry as opposed to mechanical processes (understanding flow and doing the bulk solids science homework).

00s to Present Challenges

The world survived “Y2K” at the turn of the century and the advent of the information age made possible centrally controlled and monitored processes that allowed massive production growth in all types of industries through the housing boom up to the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. As the economy expanded over a decade from the “dotcom” period in the late 1990s to the GFC demand for foods metals fossil fuels consumer goods plastics cement/concrete and building materials rose rapidly.

Consumer goods diversity emerged with wide product offerings to meet the insatiable global appetite. This required manufacturing facilities to retool their factories toward customization and agile production methods to meet the fickle demands of their previously loyal customer base.

For instance in the 1970s there were only a handful of dry beverage juice drinks such as those with flavors of cherry grape and lemonade. A factory back then could easily blend the main ingredients of sugar pectin citric acid and simple flavors to mass produce a product that consumers loyally purchased. Fast-forward to current times whereby dry beverage manufacturers have to produce hundreds of Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) that have varying flavors sweetness natural or artificial sweeteners with or without additives providing minerals or even nutraceuticals. Instead of having silos with sugar and citric acid with minor flavor bins the modern factory must handle dozens of large ingredients in banks of silos along with portable bin containers or bulk bags for intermediate additives with paper sacks or bottles for minors. The range of flow characteristics encountered at these facilities is mind-boggling and designing storage discharge and feeding equipment to reliably handle all of these materials without flow obstructions caking attrition or segregation requires the use of solids handling technology.

In addition to the handling challenges the increased number of ingredients also resulted in not only more frequent dust explosions but also continued loss of life. Many of the bulk solids handled in agriculture plastics metals foods pharmaceuticals and wood/biomass industries are susceptible to deflagrations (i.e. fire flash fire or dust explosion) when the right combination of ingredients for a combustible dust event are present. In an unfortunate catastrophic explosion in 2008 14 workers were killed4. The explosion which was caused by ignition of a sugar dust cloud in a covered belt conveyor resulted in $60M in damages. In another example a massive plant explosion at Didion Milling in 20175 killed five workers and injured 11 due to a dry corn product deflagration in a fluid bed dryer. Recall two decades ago with West Pharmaceuticals6 and its massive dust explosion event whereby six were killed and dozens injured from fine plastic powder dust deflagration.

Worldwide factories continue to employ a range of dust collectors bucket elevators ovens/dryers mills/grinders mixers/blenders pneumatic conveying systems and silos/bins/hoppers to store process and transport all types of powders and bulk solids many of which can be subject to combustible dust hazards. Increased attention has been given to combustible dust hazards and what measures could be taken to eliminate or reduce the likelihood of hazards. In fact the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) is currently developing Standard 660 which will be a promulgation of several of the individual combustible dust standards whether for fundamentals (NFPA 652) design (NFPA 654 and 91) or commodity specific for wood sulfur metals and food/agriculture (NFPA 664 655 484 and 61). This will have a positive effect on education and practical use by a myriad of industries handling combustible dusts as the new standard will provide simplification on fundamentals common to each standard as well as unique hazard recognition and mitigations for commodity specific situations.

The turn of the century also witnessed increased recycling in a variety of industries like glass plastics and metals. Though glass and metals readily incorporated post-consumer recycle scrap plastics recycling remains difficult due to several types of plastics that often cannot be mixed into a single stream. Separation of polyethylene from polypropylene can be difficult and as a result the captured mixed recycle stream is commonly landfilled wasting (literally) the recycling efforts.

Another important bulk solids handling challenge over the past two decades has been the incorporation of biomass or alternative fuels with fossil fuels. An example of this is the co-firing of wood chips with bituminous coal. Though the heating value of the wood and coal is often similar the low density of the wood chips requires nearly two or three times the volume of material to be mixed in with coal for stochiometric combustion as a pulverized mixture. This creates handling problems with the coal/chips blend often resulting in flow obstructions and segregation issues. Furthermore using coal pulverizing equipment such as ball or rod mills does not typically work well with wood chips which require hammermills for size reduction. This mismatch of equipment requires process modifications incurring additional costs and project time.

Fossil fuel combustion plants also implemented costly back-end-technologies for air pollution control to abate harmful emissions leading to acid rain and mercury release. This environmental and public health necessity came at the cost of handling difficult reagents like hydrated lime prilled urea and activated carbon as well as byproducts such as synthetic gypsum and coal ash.

Another challenge facing manufacturing over the past few decades is that of technical staff turnover and retention. Though many engineers enjoyed longevity at manufacturing facilities before the turn of the century staff attrition has negatively affected knowledge transfer to replacement staff (assuming there is replacement). Some companies have eliminated their engineering staff through outsourcing to engineering/procurement/construction (EPC) firms. In some cases this has worked acceptably; in other cases the lack of internal engineering staff with prior project experience and specialized knowledge has resulted in process inefficiencies costly design mistakes and poor sustainability. In earlier decades engineers would often develop a process with equipment components that they sized specified procured and installed. In the past two decades many companies have turned to equipment vendors that could provide comprehensive turnkey packages with sole source responsibilities for process specification design fabrication installation and commissioning. Though this has worked in many industries for a myriad of applications it has at times suffered from a lack of comprehensive engineering process and left a knowledge gap at factories given the bulk solids handling insights have remained with the vendors.



Industry Changes Through Four Decades

While there have been significant challenges in solids handling over the past four decades there have also been notable advances.

80s and 90s Advances

Educational opportunities for powder and bulk solids handling science and technology grew significantly in the 80s and 90s. Powder & Bulk Solids magazine certainly had a role to play with its focus on technology equipment and vendors servicing the myriad of industries handling bulk materials (each month’s issue was dutifully added to our library shelves and often referenced by our engineers). The International Powder & Bulk Solids Conference and Exhibition held annually outside Chicago IL and similar conferences held in Europe and even Australia offered great opportunities for learning and information exchange. Given bulk solids and powder technology were generally not taught in US universities many engineers would learn about important flow phenomena at specialized courses taught at these conferences or through periodicals or books that began emerging during these decades. Furthermore AIChE began offering an intensive two-day course on bulk solids flow fundamentals taught by experienced Jenike & Johanson engineers. This course along with a fundamentals course on pneumatic transport remains in the top three most popular courses offered by AIChE.

Another advancement in these decades was with flow aids such as air cannons and vibrators. There can often be a sharp difference of opinion regarding their effectiveness in initiating or enhancing flow. In some cases they can be quite effective; in others they can cause more problems than intended to solve. Air cannons evolved to not only help overcome bridging problems with materials that remained at rest but also for use with buildup and unclogging of stubborn transfer chutes. Though air cannon application is generally science based with air shock and pressure wave theory application of vibration is usually via trial-and-error as first-principles theory has not effectively been developed.

Off-shoring of manufacturing in the US in the 80s and 90s--whether it be computer chips electronics appliances shoes and garments or furniture--had a big impact on the powder and solids handling industry. First in some cases there was a loss of material handling knowledge as manufacturing moved to low-cost countries that preferred brute-force labor intensive methods over efficiency. Second quality often suffered due to the use of inferior feedstocks or lack of quality checks and assurances. Third impacts occurred with returning products to the US especially if in powder or solid form (e.g. specialty chemicals pharmaceutical active ingredients and excipients). Materials returned to the US could be caked or damaged in some other means due to transoceanic shipment.

These decades also saw emersion of new instrumentation and controls with distributed integrated networks linking to control rooms for remote monitoring and operations. In fact a 2000 ton per day cement plant in the 1970s may have needed a work force of 350 to operate while with the advent of control systems and remote operations cement plants by the end of the 1990s needed half that staff.

Another sea-change was with material characterization and pilot-scale modeling of powder and solids processes. Due to the success of conferences periodicals courses and books on material flow fundamentals many companies handling bulk solids became aware of the negative impacts of poor solids flow. Some large companies such as Dow DuPont and Procter & Gamble invested in a dedicated solids handling technology group as business units specialized in producing solids whether they were resins seeds specialty pigments or consumer goods like soap or chips.

Process hazard analyses7 (PHAs) became more prevalent in these decades as they were vital to assessing hazards and risks with highly hazardous chemicals. Though risks with gases and liquids are often reviewed there remained major knowledge and experience gaps with hazards from combustible dusts.

00s to Present Advances

The turn of the millennium saw a significant increase in information exchange with bulk solids handling due to the rapid growth of the internet. As dial-up faded out and fiber optic and digital networks blossomed exchange of information via email and PDF files quickly replaced clipped articles.

Another important change to the industry was the emersion of ASTM standards for characterizing powders and bulk solids. ASTM standards D6128/D6773 provided methodology and precision for measuring cohesive strength and wall friction angles while D6940/D6941 provided test methods for segregation behaviors by sifting and fluidization mechanisms. A standard method for measuring the bulk density and compressibility of a powder or bulk solid was released in D6683.

Automation and distributed control systems with wireless technology and remote operation became routine for major manufacturing facilities whereby plant managers could monitor and control (if needed) the plant. Reliance on localized personnel operations reduced while an increase on SPC and labor cost reductions occurred. Automation allowed some mines to implement autonomous vehicles that were monitored from locations hundreds of miles away. This also created a newer threat with remote control operations where cybersecurity risks loomed large. There have been several recent major news events illustrating where plant operations were hijacked (2021 Colonial Pipeline8) by the weak link of a single password failure.

As manufacturing facilities domestically began to lose engineering staff either through attrition retirements or consolidation engineering and equipment firms stepped up with offerings of complete or turnkey bulk solids handling systems. Facilities were pleased in many cases with this approach as a sole-source responsibility for project management design build install and start-up/commission was provided. This helped to reduce hand-off misses or gaps in equipment trains but also created stretch design situations where some vendors incorporated ancillary technologies they were not fully familiar with.

The plastics industry expanded rapidly in the past few decades through processing vessels increasing from 3 to 8 m diameter and yielding up to 1 billion tons per year capacity for polypropylene and polyethylene. Plastics have been in the forefront of continuous manufacturing with minimal change-over times during grade adjustments especially effective when employing mass flow technology.

The US has been the top CO2 emitter9 and is now pivoting towards aggressive CO2 reduction goals. Specialized carbon capture technologies are being developed where bulk solids handling science plays an important role. Whether absorbing gases on granular solids or on thin layers of receptive powders reliable consistent and accurate material handling is key to the success of these emerging technologies. Solar and battery storage technologies are accelerating rapidly. However there are substantial environmental impacts with aggressive mining and wet process chemical refinement of silicon and spodumene ore (lithium aluminum inosilicate).

Additive Manufacturing (AM or “3D printing”) technology is growing rapidly. AM is a process of making parts in layers in a semi-compact sized machine directly from CAD software output without the need for complex and costly tools and with minimal waste material (near net shape). Some have described a shoe factory filled with a thousand AM machines producing custom shoes; clearly economies of scale apply and may preclude this approach.

AM still must deal with powder segregation particle density variability and particle weight issues that have been plaguing it for decades. Additionally dust hazards analysis (DHA) of processes with combustible particulate solids or dusts will be important with reducing or eliminating risks of fires flash fires or dust explosions with not only metals but also plastics wood foods pharmaceuticals and many specialty chemicals.

Bulk solids handling issues like chute plugging limited-live stockpile capacity and abrasive wear of equipment are continually experienced in the mining industry. As Discrete Element Method (DEM)10 technology and education improve focus will pivot towards prevention rather than costly retrofits. In fact process simulations via multi-physics where fluids and gases are modeled alongside particles will be commonplace. Digital twins where there is a digital representation of a physical object or process contextualized in a digital version of its environment will help companies to assess process variability and to cost-effectively tune operations with minimal risks.



The Future of Dry Processing and Bulk Solids Handling

As one can imagine there are a myriad of future challenges with respect to powders and bulk solids. There are new bulk solids yet to be discovered with unique properties. For instance consider nano-powders where the average particle size ranges from 1 to 100 nanometers (copy paper thickness is about 100000 nanometers). These tiny particles are composed of hundreds of atoms and have a massive surface area-to-volume ratio making them attractive as catalysts for optics and even having quantum effects abilities. However there are important considerations for dust explosion hazards especially with nano-metals and toxicity concerns as nanoparticles can readily cross into the blood barrier through lung tissue exposure.

Bulk solids handling also has an impact on our environment in dozens of ways. Mines for minerals are rapidly searching for new technologies that reduce energy use and minimize water use for washing leaching purifying and dedusting. If mines increase their solids throughput yields yet ignore basic material handling principles greater dusting problems could easily occur. Subsea mining is at its infancy with massive potential for metals particularly nickel manganese cobalt and lithium. The challenge will be transporting these bulk solids several miles in piping under extreme pressures and separating the minerals from the sea water without causing major disruption to the seabed or ocean.

Green energy initiatives such as green ammonia to make fertilizer or the cracking of methane gas to yield “green hydrogen” are attractive given they do not derive from oil. However they do yield a carbon bulk solids by-product that is transformed into “carbon black.” For those familiar with carbon black and its typical horrendous handling properties watch out for scale-up with those processes!

Automation will continue its massive penetration into manufacturing as we have witnessed for the past four decades. Reliable material handling plays an even greater role with automation as control logic will not be able to easily compensate for flow interruptions caused by bridging or ratholing which can completely stop a process. Engineers and process designers should recognize that proper bulk solids equipment design must come before adding layers of automation and control. This can be a hard lesson to learn for the uninitiated. Again this requires increased automation for all types of bulk material handling operations such as feedstock loading storing blending sizing processing of all types packaging and shipping. Though artificial intelligence (AI) has a role here if automation does not have reliable handling based on first principles then no amount of electronics and controls can meet the facility demands. Continued education of engineers in bulk solids is critical.

One of the last challenges to be mentioned is that beyond our planet. NASA has been studying reclaim and processing of lunar regolith as well as simulants for Martian soil. As some may have observed one of the Mars rovers experienced difficulties drilling into the soil11 whereby the resistance on the drill caused the rover to rotate (Newton’s 3rd Law in action). Think also about handling lunar soil in 1/6th the gravity of Earth. Trust us when we say that flow obstructions do not decrease when gravity reduces. In fact it is the complete opposite as Andrew Jenike demonstrated!

Pandemic? ‘Nuff said.

Summary

Bulk solids handling systems have come a long way from needing a sledgehammer next to each bin and silo. Many operations have embraced bulk solids handling technology as a reliable means to avoid and solve problems associated with bulk solids. There is no reason this technology shouldn’t be employed in every instance bulk solids are handled so that a future Rand study can conclude there is little difference between solids handling plants and those handling gases and fluids. This would result in tremendous benefit to the world with operations that keep operators safe and produce high-quality products at desired rates with minimal energy and water use.

West plays Prince Charles in the fifth season of the show as well as in part one and the soon-to-be-released part two of season six which will cover the aftermath of Princess Diana's death the premiership of Tony Blair and Prince William's relationship with Kate Middleton.

Speaking to Digital Spy West said that the show could continue past season six by going back in time rather than up to present day.

""I think it certainly could [have more seasons]"" West said. ""Peter [Morgan] never intended to get any closer to current events but I'm sure he must have thought about the previous kings and queens.""

Continuing he hinted at what era he'd like the show to explore: ""To do Edward VII would be I think interesting but I'm not sure [Morgan] wants to carry on with royals. I'd love it if he did except I can't play Edward VII now but anyway.""

West also stated just why he thinks the show has such an enduring appeal calling the royals ""the most glamorous family who's ever lived certainly who's ever been on television and so it knocks any other – I grew up with Dallas and Dynasty and it just doesn't compare does it?""

West has already spoken about the finale of the show which has confirmed that season 6's second part will be its final instalment.

The Prince Charles actor also discussed changes to the script made by Morgan following the late Queen Elizabeth II's death.

""I think what became clear to me is that The Crown is about Queen Elizabeth II. Therefore everything from Diana to Charles is secondary to that. So you end with her.

""I think what he wrote in the end was very much influenced by what happened at her funeral and the reaction to it. I thought it was desperately moving reading it.""

The Crown seasons 1-5 are streaming on Netflix with season 6 part 1 premiering on November 16 and season 6 part 2 following on December 14. Seasons 1-4 are also available on DVD and Blu-ray.

Save

Adidas may write-off the rest of its Yeezy stock following a pause on off-loading the sneakers. That’s bad news for Kanye West whose net worth has plunged even as new sneaker designs pop up. Here are the latest financial stats on Ye.

Adidas estimates that it has around $320 million in unsold Yeezy shoes that it may decide to write off instead of doing a third drop of the shoes. That’s extremely bad news for Kanye West who receives a healthy cut of every Yeezy sold even if his deal with Adidas is terminated.

Kanye West net worth went from an estimated $2 billion in 2021 to sub-$1 billion after his Adidas deal fell apart (the Adidas brand deal was estimated to account for $1.5 billion of that $2 billion figure.) Universal Music Group and The Gap also terminated their deals.

With the fallout and lack of continued sales (of which Ye earns 15%) his net worth has fallen to an estimated $400 million—meaning the Adidas deal and other terminations have cost him his billionaire status. Ye was estimated to have made as much a $220 million annually from his Adidas partnership which would have extended through 2026.

Kanye West Net Worth Snapshot: The Sharp Decline

Mid-2021: $2+ billion. Net worth peaks with Adidas The Gap other lucrative partnerships and increasing music IP valuations. October 25th 2022: Drops below $2 billion. Universal Music Group The Gap end their deals with Kanye. April 9th 2023. Drops below $1 billion. Kanye West officially dropped from Forbes billionaire list after Adidas terminates its partnership.

December 2023: Kanye West net worth sinks to $400 million as Adidas suspends plans to liquidate remaining Yeezy stock thereby eliminating a major payday for the artist.

Adidas cut ties with the rapper in October 2022 over antisemitic remarks he made online. Following that decision the German sportswear giant decided to unload the remaining stock in two releases selling through 750 million euros of product in 2023. It donated a portion of proceeds from those sales to the Anti-Defamation League and the Philonise & Keeta Floyd Institute for Social Change.

During its outlook posted for earnings this quarter it considered a possible write-off of the remaining Yeezy stock narrowing its expected loss to 100 million euros. Part of Adidas decision not to release the remaining stock comes after rising antisemitism in the breakout of the Israel-Hamas war after attacks on October 7 killed hundreds at a music festival.

In discussions about the remaining shoe inventory Adidas suggested it would be “written off.. if that will happen or not is something that we evaluate all the time so there’s currently no decision on what we’ll do. That is financially the worst case and it is a possibility. Currently there is no decision.”

“We of course hope we can do more drops next year and we can get more value out of it and donate the proceeds but right now financially we haven’t made a decision and that’s why the outlook is the way it is.” Adidas CEO Bjorn Gulden says the shoes are stored in many different locations and there are many scenarios in which they could be released.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhpbmR1c3RhbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9jaXRpZXMvcHVuZS1uZXdzL2N5Y2xvbmUtd2QtbGlrZWx5LXRvLWFmZmVjdC13aW50ZXItc2Vhc29uLXRoaXMteWVhci1pbWQtMTAxNzAxNDU3MzM5MTg1Lmh0bWzSAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaGluZHVzdGFudGltZXMuY29tL2NpdGllcy9wdW5lLW5ld3MvY3ljbG9uZS13ZC1saWtlbHktdG8tYWZmZWN0LXdpbnRlci1zZWFzb24tdGhpcy15ZWFyLWltZC0xMDE3MDE0NTczMzkxODUtYW1wLmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cyclone WD likely to affect winter season this year: IMD,"The winter season this year is likely to be adversely impacted by the upcoming cyclone in the Bay of Bengal and the possible formation of western disturbance (WD) in the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal due to which central India including Maharashtra is likely to experience above-normal minimum temperatures between December and February with little chances of a cold wave during the season. This information was given by Mrutyunjay Mohapatra director-general India Meteorological Department (IMD) during a virtual press conference organised Friday on the monthly outlook for temperature and rainfall this winter. This year the temperature was above normal level by one to three degrees Celsius says official. (REPRESENTATIVE PHOTO)

Mohapatra said “Depression has formed in the Bay of Bengal. It will intensify into ‘Cyclone Michaung’ by December 2. The movement of the cyclone is north to northwest and it will have an impact on Andhra Pradesh and adjoining areas. As a result the central part of the country will be impacted by temperature. Some areas will witness light to moderate rainfall while most areas will experience cloudy weather. The minimum temperature will remain above normal level during this period.”

“Moreover there is a possibility of the formation of a western disturbance in the later period which will also affect the winter season this year. As a result the minimum temperature will remain above normal level throughout the winter season. The impact will be more on the central parts of the country including the states of Gujarat Rajasthan Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. Some areas in south peninsular India will also experience similar conditions and these areas are likely to receive rainfall during the winter season” said Mohapatra.

Meanwhile the country experienced the third highest heavy rainfall activities in the last five years in November 2023. As per data the highest heavy rainfall activities (168) were recorded in 2021; the second highest heavy rainfall activities (98) in 2020; and the third highest heavy rainfall activities (42) in November 2023. Maharashtra too experienced around 10 to 13 heavy rainfall activities especially in the Marathwada and southern Maharashtra region. Such activities are likely to continue in December as there is a possibility of the formation of systems like cyclones western disturbance and low-pressure areas. Vineet Kumar a former researcher at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) tweeted that for the first time after 2018 all three months after the monsoon namely October November and December will see a cyclone in the Bay of Bengal.

2023 likely the warmest in the last 170 years

“The global mean near-surface temperature in 2023 (up to October) was around 1.40 degrees Celsius above the average temperature between 1850 and 1900. Based on the data till October it is virtually certain that 2023 will be the warmest year in the 174-year observance on record surpassing the previous joint warmest years namely: 2016 at 1.29 degrees Celsius above the average temperature and 2020 at 1.27 degrees Celsius above the average temperature. This year the temperature was above normal level by one to three degrees Celsius. The department is yet to declare it officially as we are waiting for the entire year’s data. Also 2015 to 2023 will be the nine warmest years on record” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra..",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijQFodHRwczovL3d3dy53ZXN0ZXJud2hlZWwuY2EvbGlmZXN0eWxlL2tpc3Mtc2F5LWZhcmV3ZWxsLXRvLWxpdmUtdG91cmluZy1iZWNvbWUtZmlyc3QtdXMtYmFuZC10by1nby12aXJ0dWFsLWFuZC1iZWNvbWUtZGlnaXRhbC1hdmF0YXJzLTc5MTY4NzLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Kiss say farewell to live touring become first US band to go virtual and become digital avatars,"On Saturday night Kiss closed out the final performance of their “The End of the Road” farewell tour at New York City’s famed Madison Square Garden.

But as dedicated fans surely know — they were never going to call it quits. Not really.

During their encore the band’s current lineup — founders Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons as well as guitarist Tommy Thayer and drummer Eric Singer — left the stage to reveal digital avatars of themselves. After the transformation the virtual Kiss launched into a performance of “God Gave Rock and Roll to You.”

The cutting-edge technology was used to tease a new chapter of the rock band: after 50 years of Kiss the band is now interested in a kind of digital immortality.

The avatars were created by George Lucas’ special-effects company Industrial Light & Magic in partnership with Pophouse Entertainment Group the latter of which was co-founded by ABBA’s Björn Ulvaeus. The two companies recently teamed up for the “ABBA Voyage” show in London in which fans could attend a full concert by the Swedish band — as performed by their digital avatars.

Per Sundin CEO of Pophouse Entertainment says this new technology allows Kiss to continue their legacy for “eternity.” He says the band wasn’t on stage during virtual performance because “that’s the key thing” of the future-seeking technology. “Kiss could have a concert in three cities in the same night across three different continents. That’s what you could do with this.”

In order to create their digital avatars who are depicted as a kind of superhero version of the band Kiss performed in motion capture suits.

Experimentation with this kind of technology has become increasingly common in certain sections of the music industry. In October K-pop star Mark Tuan partnered with Soul Machines to create an autonomously automated “digital twin” called “Digital Mark.” In doing so Tuan became the first celebrity to attach their likeness to OpenAI’s GPT integration artificial intelligence technology that allows fans to engage in one-on-one conversations with Tuan’s avatar.

Aespa the K-pop girl group frequently perform alongside their digital avatars — the quartet is meant to be viewed as an octet with digital twins. Another girl group Eternity is made up entirely of virtual characters — no humans necessary.

“What we’ve accomplished has been amazing but it’s not enough. The band deserves to live on because the band is bigger than we are” Kiss frontman Paul Stanley said in a roundtable interview. “It’s exciting for us to go the next step and see Kiss immortalized.”

“We can be forever young and forever iconic by taking us to places we’ve never dreamed of before” Kiss bassist Gene Simmons added. “The technology is going to make Paul jump higher than he’s ever done before.”

And for those who couldn’t make the Madison Square Garden show — stay tuned because a Kiss avatar concert may very well be on the way.

Some Coca-Cola products on the shelves of Levittown-area stores will be looking a bit different in the near future.

Philadelphia-based Liberty Coca-Cola Beverages and WestRock a provider of sustainable paper and packaging solutions have teamed up to introduce a paperboard carrier for multipack bottled beverages replacing traditional plastic rings.

Liberty Coca-Cola Beverages will use WestRock’s PETCollar Shield Plus product to package popular Coca-Cola brands in both 12-ounce and 16.9-ounce sizes.

The new paperboard carrier packaging system is expected to be operational by summer 2024 at Liberty Coca-Cola Beverages.

Fran McGorry co-owner of Liberty Coca-Cola Beverages stated the company’s dedication to investing in recyclable beverage containers and reducing secondary plastic packaging.

The company introduced paperboard packaging for mini-cans in 2022.

The company aims to eliminate about 200000 pounds of plastic annually from Liberty Coca-Cola Beverages’ footprint.

Company officials said Liberty Coca-Cola Beverages will be the first in the world to use the PETCollar Shield Plus bottle clip.

The initiative will be pioneered at Liberty Coca-Cola Beverages’ Philadelphia facility.

The sodas with the new carriers will be distributed across Liberty’s service area in Philadelphia New Jersey and New York City.

Liberty Coca-Cola Beverages was among the first to distribute bottles made entirely from recycled plastic (excluding cap and label).

As part of its ongoing efforts the company has also installed a sustainable compacter significantly reducing its carbon footprint and enhancing its recycling capacity for plastic and aluminum containers.

“We are passionate about making investments in the communities we serve” said Paul Mulligan co-owner of Liberty Coca-Cola Beverages. “We truly care about the environment and we will continue to invest in systems that raise the bar for the entire industry. We want to lead by example and do the right thing.”

Single-use plastics are among the most wasteful consumer goods and some municipalities have implemented bans on them.

(NYSE:WMB) For Its Upcoming Dividend,"Readers hoping to buy The Williams Companies Inc. (NYSE:WMB) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning you will need to purchase Williams Companies' shares before the 7th of December to receive the dividend which will be paid on the 26th of December.

The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.45 per share on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$1.79 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions Williams Companies has a trailing yield of approximately 4.8% on its current stock price of $37.28. We love seeing companies pay a dividend but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result readers should always check whether Williams Companies has been able to grow its dividends or if the dividend might be cut.

Check out our latest analysis for Williams Companies

Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit then the dividend could be unsustainable. Its dividend payout ratio is 77% of profit which means the company is paying out a majority of its earnings. The relatively limited profit reinvestment could slow the rate of future earnings growth. We'd be concerned if earnings began to decline. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Williams Companies generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out 81% of its free cash flow as dividends which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth.

It's positive to see that Williams Companies's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.

Click here to see the company's payout ratio plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.

Have Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?

Companies with falling earnings are riskier for dividend shareholders. If earnings fall far enough the company could be forced to cut its dividend. That's why it's not ideal to see Williams Companies's earnings per share have been shrinking at 2.7% a year over the previous five years.

Story continues

Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. In the past 10 years Williams Companies has increased its dividend at approximately 2.2% a year on average. The only way to pay higher dividends when earnings are shrinking is either to pay out a larger percentage of profits spend cash from the balance sheet or borrow the money. Williams Companies is already paying out a high percentage of its income so without earnings growth we're doubtful of whether this dividend will grow much in the future.

To Sum It Up

Is Williams Companies an attractive dividend stock or better left on the shelf? While earnings per share are shrinking it's encouraging to see that at least Williams Companies's dividend appears sustainable with earnings and cashflow payout ratios that are within reasonable bounds. It's not the most attractive proposition from a dividend perspective and we'd probably give this one a miss for now.

So if you're still interested in Williams Companies despite it's poor dividend qualities you should be well informed on some of the risks facing this stock. To help with this we've discovered 3 warning signs for Williams Companies (1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you ought to be aware of before buying the shares.

If you're in the market for strong dividend payers we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.

At first it’s a shooting at a pizza restaurant that echoes the real-life absurdity of Pizzagate. Lillian is separated from her classmates during the chaos and is soon roped into the pointless rebellion of some raucous Maryland punks. When she breaks away from them she finds some solace in the company of a monotonous motormouth neo-Nazi (Simon Rex) who is obsessed with Edgar Allan Poe and decrying youth. Rex's character provides Williams ample opportunities for American flags to cameo in the background like how Michael Bay uses them as product placement in his ""Transformers"" films.

The movie uses this loose set-up to be something of a screed in which Lillian is roped in by one cartoonish wannabe shyster after another. Everyone tries to control her in one way after the next thanks to how they project upon her and objectify her. But Lillian is smarter than that in a way the script isn't precious about but it does make for a compelling mysterious performance from Ryder. It’s a star-affirming performance starting with the opening credits sequence in which Ryder swoons an incredibly catchy dream pop ballad to herself in the bathroom mirror.

Lillian’s travels take her across America and are filled with characters who should be funny especially given the cast Williams and company have pulled together—Ayo Edebiri Jeremy O. Harris and Jacob Elordi also appear as caricatures who are drawn to Lillian and eventually make her a star. (When she’s both a missing persons headline Lillian's also a budding tabloid figure and that’s one of this story's more amusing jokes.) But each time we meet these new characters their bizarre arcs lose individual momentum. Pinkerton's script is talky to a fault with its main point being that to engage with our modern country one must use gibberish. The dry jokes about these people being delusional of lying to themselves while trying to lie to Lillian become easier and more obvious. In some instances Williams' film is simply just being smug.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJhbHRpbW9yZXN1bi5jb20vMjAyMy8xMi8wMy9iYWx0aW1vcmUtZmludGVjaC1lbnRyZXByZW5ldXItc29sby1mdW5kcy1ibGFjay1vd25lZC1sZW5kZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tech entrepreneur from Baltimore started the nation's largest Black-owned fintech platform a peer-to-peer microlender,Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window),https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmt0bnYuY29tL25ld3MvdG93LXRydWNrcy1uZXZhZGEtc3RhdGUtcG9saWNlLXRvLWhvbGQtbWVtb3JpYWwtZHJpdmUtaW4taG9ub3Itb2YtZmFsbGVuLXN0YXRlLXRyb29wZXJz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nevada State Police tow trucks to hold memorial drive in honor of fallen state troopers,"LAS VEGAS (KTNV) — The two Nevada State Troopers killed in a hit-and-run on I-15 will be honored with a memorial drive on Saturday hosted by local tow truck companies and the Nevada State Police Highway Patrol.

Posted on: December 3 2023 01:44h.

Last updated on: December 3 2023 01:44h.

Bally’s efforts to bring a casino hotel to Chicago — the city’s first such venue — could be marred by multiple investigations potentially including one by the US Attorney’s Office into the process by which the company won the bidding competition.

Crain’s Chicago Business reported the US Attorney’s Office is looking into complaints from other gaming operators that lost in the Chicago casino competition. The federal agency didn’t confirm the inquiry to the media outlet but Ald. Brian Hopkins (D-Ward 2) said the investigation is happening. Hopkins has previously vocally criticized former Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s (D-Chicago) handling of the casino bidding race. Earlier this month the alderman said the $1.7 billion project is now in jeopardy.

Unidentified sources told Crain’s that Chicago Inspector General Deborah Witzburg is also looking into the matter. Her office’s policy is to not comment on possible investigations. A spokeswoman for Bally’s told Crain’s the regional casino operator isn’t aware of any investigations but there is speculation that both the federal and local inquiries have been ongoing for several months.

The Rhode Island-based gaming company has been operating a temporary casino at Medinah Temple in the River North section of Chicago for over two months. It is aiming to open a permanent casino hotel at the Freedom Center a 30-acre riverfront property that Tribune Publishing has occupied in 2026.

Rivals That Could Be Upset About Bally’s Chicago Casino

Lightfoot selected Bally’s as the winning bidder for the Chicago casino license in May 2022 over Hard Rock International — the gaming arm of the Seminole Tribe of Florida — and Chicago-based Rush Street Gaming.

While the Windy City is the third-largest in the US just four operators submitted proposals to even participate in the competition and the process failed to lure big-name Las Vegas gaming companies such as MGM Resorts International and Wynn Resorts due to the onerous tax rates Illinois and the city set for the gaming venue.

Between Hard Rock and Rush Street it’s not clear which one feels more jilted by Bally’s being crowned the victor in Chicago but reports have surfaced that Rush Street was charged twice as much as Bally’s to file bids for various potential casino locations.

Additionally and in the tradition of Chicago’s notorious history of political corruption it’s believed a city consultant that examined the financial health of the bidders raised money for Bally’s and that wasn’t disclosed to aldermen prior to the vote. At the end of the third quarter the gaming company had $3.44 billion in debt which is well excess of its current market capitalization of $525.57 million.

‘Worst Decision’

Hopkins previously characterized Lightfoot’s selection of Bally’s as one of her worst decisions which is saying something given that she was swept out of office after just one term and that her approval ratings were dismal.

He was among seven members of the city council that voted against the choice of Bally’s. The gaming company has drawn the ire of Chicago policymakers on other fronts. For example Ald. Brendan Reilly (D-Ward 42) in October 2022 lambasted a traffic study conducted by Bally’s for the Medinah Temple casino bashing the claim that 40% of visitors to the temporary casino will bike walk or use public transportation.

Potentially adding to the brewing controversy is the point that the city allowed Bally’s to alter the terms of an agreement with minority that would allow the gaming company to buy those shareholders out of the Chicago project at a price that cannot be negotiated according to Crain’s.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndvcmxkcG9rZXJ0b3VyLmNvbS9uZXdzL2luLWZvY3VzLWEtd3B0LXByZW1pZXItbWVldC11cC1nYW1lLXBob3RvLWJsb2cv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,In Focus: A WPT Premier Meet-Up Game Photo Blog,"The second annual WPT Premier Meet-Up Game kicked off the WPT World Championship at Wynn Las Vegas. Poker fans came from around the world to play cash games and have fun alongside some of the biggest starts in the game. Photographer Drew Amato captured it all.

For the second year in a row the World Poker Tour kicked off the WPT World Championship at Wynn Las Vegas by hosting the Premier Meet-Up Game at Wynn Las Vegas to give poker players enthusiasts and fans alike the opportunity to play with some of the biggest legends in poker. The buzz from the poker room in the Wynn was impossible to ignore and legendary photographer Drew Amato was in the house to capture every amazing moment.

The schedule said pretty clearly that the start time for the Premier MUG was 9 a.m. but that didn’t stop the absolute diehards from getting their early to secure a seat and by 8 a.m. nearly all 28 tables were full.

One of the faces of the World Poker Tour WPT anchor Lynn Gilmartin was handing out bad beats raffle tickets and high fives as she moved from table to table on Friday.

Just 24 hours before the WPT Premier MUG kicked off Gus Hansen was announced as an addition to the line up of poker superstars in the field. Hansen who won the first ever World Poker Tour event in 2002 was also the first player to win three WPT titles. Not only did he bring that impressive resume to the Premier MUG he also brought with him one helluva poker face.

For the last six and a half years Tony Dunst has been in the WPT commentator calling all of the action at WPT final tables. On Friday he was in the action and his personality and passion for poker was on full display.

In case there was any doubt about the can’t-miss status of the WPT Premier MUG the fact that the man who is the busiest person on the planet at this time of year made it out should put that thought to bed. Santa Claus came to town on Friday and brought a jolly energy to an already bustling room

After nearly five hours of action all eyes turned to the raffle which awards five seats to the WPT Prime Championship and a single seat to the $10400 WPT World Championship event. Sunao Kitahara took home the big prize and now turns his WPT Premier MUG adventure into a shot at a share of the $40 million guaranteed prize pool.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmdvbGZkaWdlc3QuY29tL2NvdXJzZXMvZ3VpZGVzL2Jlc3QtcHVibGljLWdvbGYtY291cnNlcy1sYXMtdmVnYXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The best courses you can play in Las Vegas,"Public Shadow Creek North Las Vegas NV

The Match between Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods may have fizzled as a pay-per-view spectacle but the venue was certainly a showcase during the Black Friday 2018 broadcast. Shadow Creek has the reputation of being one of the most expensive courses built in America a reported $47 million at the time. Designer Tom Fazio said that budget was necessary at Shadow Creek to perform what he now calls “total site manipulation” creating an environment where none existed by carving rolling hills and canyons from the flat desert floor north of Las Vegas and pumping in plenty of water. Alas this once-in-a-lifetime dream design has been too successful triggering many equally expensive but inferior imitations.

The proposal currently undergoing scrutiny by community boards borough presidents’ offices and the Planning Commission represents a strategic move to strategically position gambling establishments in specific commercial and manufacturing districts across the city.

Dan Garodnick Chair of the CPC and Director of the Department of City Planning (DCP) underscored the need for fairness in the casino application process within the city. “As the state considers proposals for casinos downstate we must create a level playing field for applicants within New York City so they can compete for this opportunity” he emphasized. The proposed text amendment seeks to simplify the approval process within the city’s zoning regulations while avoiding redundancy with the state’s comprehensive licensing procedures.

Should the proposed changes be approved potential casinos in designated districts across all boroughs would enjoy as-of-right status. Applicants within these zones would only need approval from the state and its Community Advisory Committee to proceed with their projects sidestepping the typically lengthy Uniform Land Use Review Procedure.

This potential shift is particularly promising for developers seeking one of the coveted downstate licenses issued by the New York State Gaming Commission. Notable proposals such as the collaboration between Related Companies and Wynn Resorts in the Hudson Yards align seamlessly with the proposed zoning changes leveraging existing commercial and manufacturing zoning designations.

The citywide initiative aims to ensure that casino applications within New York City remain competitive in the broader state process avoiding any disadvantages compared to those in surrounding counties as reported by Politico. Garodnick explained that the text amendment would prevent duplicating the state’s rigorous licensing process while establishing a rational framework for consideration within the city’s zoning.

The proposal also addresses concerns about a potential influx of individual land use applications from each casino bidder. Under the suggested text amendment gaming facilities with state licenses would be permitted in specified commercial and manufacturing zones deemed compliant with all applicable use and bulk zoning regulations.

Thor Equities’ plan for a gaming house in Coney Island falling within the advantageous C7 zone and Stefan Soloviev’s vision for an entertainment district in the C5-2 zone are among the proposals aligning with the proposed zoning changes.

Several other noteworthy proposals including Point72 Asset Management’s plan near Citi Field in Queens and SL Green Realty Jay-Z’s Roc Nation and Caesars Entertainment‘s proposal for a gaming floor in Times Square also fit seamlessly into the proposed zoning framework.

While several proposals seamlessly fit into the envisioned zoning framework challenges may arise for projects like Steve Cohen and Bally’s in the Bronx facing additional hurdles such as the need for permission to build on parkland according to Crain’s New York Business.

As the seven-month process unfolds the city anticipates a comprehensive restructuring of its zoning regulations potentially heralding a renaissance in the gaming and entertainment landscape across New York City. The proposal’s review by the city’s community boards and borough presidents will precede a vote by the Council next year. The potential shift raises questions about the community’s stance on bringing gambling to Harlem inviting public discussion and opinions on this transformative proposal.

Coming off a fifth-place finish at state last season the Cardinals return 11 starters. That includes four state participants and two medalists.

“We’ve just been working hard the first two weeks” said junior Conlan Carlson who placed third in Class AAA at 138 pounds. “Everyone knows we have a high-caliber team and we’re all prepared to go into battle.”

Willmar kicks off the season Saturday at the St. Michael-Albertville Invitational. Along with the top-ranked Knights (Class AAA) hosting the tournament other ranked teams in the field include Kasson-Mantorville (second AA) and Forest Lake (12th AAA).

“I think starting off with kind of a bang I think it really helps especially getting us ready right now” Conlan said.

That’s just the start of a stacked schedule for Willmar.

It’ll wrestle a pair of top individual tournaments in the MatBoss Minnesota Christmas Tournament on Dec. 15-16 in Rochester and the Rumble on the Red on Dec. 28-29 at Fargo North Dakota. There are also team tournaments in Eden Prairie on Jan. 6 and the Kiffmeyer Duals in St. Cloud on Jan. 13.

It’s all in an effort to build the Cardinals into a title contender. They’re hoping to make state for a fourth straight season. In 2022-23 they beat Bemidji 33-25 for the Section 8AAA crown. At state  Willmar lost 43-25 to eventual state champion Hastings before getting back-to-back wins against Rochester Mayo (48-16) and Apple Valley (43-21) to claim the consolation championship.

Willmar is ranked 11th in the first Class AAA state poll released Thursday from The Guillotine a statewide wrestling publication.

“We have high expectations for ourselves as individuals but also as a team trying to build off that fifth place and maybe place higher” said sophomore Cameren Champagne who’s a captain along with Conlan Carlson and Cavin Carlson.

“We’re just trying to make sure that we can build ourselves and become better wrestlers every day and show the state that we are a top-notch team.”

Five Cardinals are starting the season ranked in the top 10 of their respective weights. Juniors Steven Cruze (172) and Sully Anez (145) are both ranked fourth. Conlan Carlson (152) is fifth sophomore Cavin Carlson (139) is sixth and senior Ivan Mares (133) is ninth.

Willmar head coach Ed Oehlers says the team is still looking for athletes to fill the lightweight spots at 107 and 114 but is confident those holes will be filled by season’s end.

The middleweights will be a daunting challenge for Willmar’s opponents.

“It’s going to be a gantlet for some of those teams to score against us” Oehlers said. “We got a lot of guys returning even down in the 120s with Wyatt Cruze. Then when you start hitting the guys like Ivan Mares Sully Anez Conlan Carlson Cavin Carlson Cameren Champagne all those guys through the middle it’s just going to be back-to-back-to-back there.”

While there are about 50 wrestlers in the room there are also fewer spots on the lineup after the Minnesota State High School League changed the number of weight classes from 14 to 13. The new weight classes are 107 114 121 127 133 139 145 152 160 172 189 215 and 285.

“You can tell there’s definitely a lot of competition already” Conlan said. “This is some of the most wrestle-offs we’ve had in a while. There’s a lot more competition in the room; everybody’s working hard.”

Oehlers added “I think we’re going to have a really solid lineup.”

For his part Champagne is bumping up from being an All-Central Lakes Conference performer at 145 to 160.

“I got really big for football this year but now I’m cutting back into shape and hopefully maintain as much muscle as I possibly can to compete with these bigger guys” Champagne said. “(I'm) just trying to go out there and do the best I can even if they’re stronger use my technique and hopefully win.”

Conlan’s goal is crystal clear after taking third place at 138 last season a runner-up showing at 126 in 2022 and a fifth-place finish at 113 in ‘21.

“State champ’s my goal” he said hoping to become the sixth Carlson to win a state title. Conlan’s father Chad (1989-90) and brother Cael (2018-19) each won two state titles. His uncle Carl (1992) and cousins Colten (2016) and Clay (2018) were also champions.

The Cardinas are also hoping to win their 11th straight CLC title and extend their 82-match conference win streak.

“Even just getting in the room and seeing some of the different levels of kids that we have on the team keeps these guys refreshed” Oehlers said. “Plus they’re young enough that they’re focused on getting better every day and having fun with the sport. We definitely have a task at hand every day. We seem pretty focused.

“For us coaches to see them with the optimism and energy that they have is pretty exciting.”

Lund scored the game-winning goal quickly after a faceoff against Mahtomedi in overtime for a 7-6 victory on Dec. 2 at the St. Croix Valley Recreation Center in Stillwater. It flipped the script of the teams’ last meeting on March 11 in the Class 1A state championship game when Mahtomedi won 6-5 in double overtime off of a faceoff with a play known as “lava cake.”

“I wanted it so bad. The rest of the team [did too] … there’s quite a few guys [here] who know how it feels to lose in the state championship” Lund said. “We just did everything right off of the faceoff ran play and did everything right. Just amazing for the team and everybody.”

Senior forward Murray Marvin-Cordes set up Lund with the assist for the winning goal 3:38 into overtime. Warriors players crowded in celebration at the face-off circle as if they won much more than a regular season game.

Warroad (3-1) ranked No. 5 in Class 1A according to Let’s Play Hockey and No. 3 Mahtomedi (1-3) came out flying as if it wasn’t a December game too. The Zephyrs and Warriors traded goals in the first period amid three lead changes but Mahtomedi came away with a 5-3 edge headed into the locker room.

“Especially that first period was just wide open. Not a lot of defense either way” said Warroad coach Jay Hardwick. “I didn’t know if the whole game was going to be like that or if it was going to settle down because sometimes it does.

“But it was mostly wide open the whole game. Drives you nuts a little bit but if you can play that way and come out on top it’s alright.”

Lund led the rally with two goals in the second period on assists from Carson Pilgrim and Marvin-Cordes to tie things up at 5-5. Sophomore forward Dominic Anthony put the Warriors ahead 6-5 with the first assist to Lund.

While Mahtomedi knotted it up 6-6 on senior forward Patrick Egan’s goal the Zephyrs made a significant adjustment down the stretch. Junior goaltender Wes Strub subbed in for senior goalie Charlie Brandt who saw 30 shots in less than two periods. Strub stopped 15 shots in 30 minutes six seconds on the ice before Lund spoiled his outing.

“He gave up the goal at the end but he made several key saves” Mahtomedi coach Jeff Poeschl said about Strub. “It’s tough to come in in the middle of a game. He made a lot of real good saves to keep us in it.”

Warroad and Mahtomedi piled on the shots with 91 combined which didn’t quite match their output at the Xcel Energy Center last season. The skaters went wild at the “X” with 109 combined shots on goal in that game.

“We always have a good battle with Warroad whether it’s in the regular season or in a state tournament game” Poeschl said.

Hardwick concurred about the seasoned Class 1A powerhouse rivalry.

“Every game we play Mahtomedi for the last three to four years we’ve played very good hockey games so they knew what they were getting into” he said.

Warroad locked down the latest matchup with Mahtomedi with defense in the third period and a big penalty kill in overtime. Pilgrim’s late slashing minor in the third period didn’t stymie the Warriors going into the extra period on the road.

“It was an opportunity missed” Poeschl said.

Mahtomedi only got off two shots in the extra period while the Warriors took five shots on goal. That’s after the Zephyrs outshot the Warriors 12-5 in the third but to no avail.

“I told them before the third [period] that we need to go out and focus and … taking care of our end and eliminating their chances and the offense will take care of itself” Hardwick said. “And it’s kind of what happened.”

Warroad didn’t make a goalie change as senior Ben Norris stopped 39 shots with an .867 save percentage. He staved off 12 Mahtomedi shots in the third period alone.

“I didn’t think any of the goals he let in were bad goals” Hardwick said about Norris. “It was more of the chances and opportunities for getting in. I hadn’t really thought about that because he made some really big saves for us and I wasn’t about to pull him out. I thought he got better as the game went on and gave us a chance to win.”

The inaugural Post Bulletin Girls Wrestler of the Year Smith collected her second consecutive second-place finish at the state tournament a year ago. The junior won the Stewartville Darrell Jaeger Invitational and cruised through the Section 1-2 tournament recording three consecutive pins to bring home a championship. She nearly secured the 138-pound state title but fell to Abby Ervasti of Bertha-Hewitt/Verndale/Parkers Prairie by a 3-1 decision in a tightly-contested match to finish the season with a 23-4 record.

Chloe Berg Chatfield

Berg had quite the first season in the sport a year ago. A lifelong dancer Berg brought those skills to the mat displaying great balance and strength. It helped her capture the Section 1-2 title at 126 pounds where she pinned Mackenzie Armagost to punch her ticket to state. She kept the momentum going at ""The X"" as she and brother Javier reached the state finals in their respective weight classes. Javier won a title while Chloe placed second after falling to nationally ranked Cassandra Gonzales of Shakopee. Berg has been in contact with a couple of colleges.

Jerriona Marshall Mayo

As a sophomore Marshall made history becoming the first female from Mayo to qualify for the state tournament after securing the 235-pound Section 1-2 title. At state she fell in the semifinals before recording a pin to win the third-place match.

Lauren Elsmore Pine Island

Elsmore collected her second consecutive state medal after placing third at 100 pounds. Two of her three losses last year came to nationally-ranked Caley Graber of Northfield. Elsmore won titles at the Cannon Falls Invitational — a boys tournament — as well as the Pine Island girls tournament. She placed second in the inaugural MSHSL-sanctioned girls state wrestling tournament two years ago.

Katie Whealan FCLMC

As a junior Whealan qualified for the state tournament after placing second at sections. She then placed fifth in St. Paul registering a second-period pin in her first match in the consolation bracket before recording a thrilling win by a 7-6 decision in the fifth-place match.

Ericka Hansen Lake City

Hansen aims to help the next generation of Lake City grapplers. As a sophomore she placed second at sections to join teammate Emma Hofschulte in St. Paul at the state tournament. She's one to especially watch this season.

Hattie Mathre Byron

Another expected to take a leap Mathre just missed a state berth placing third for the second consecutive season at sections at 145 as just an eighth-grader. The now-freshman has worked hard on her craft with the Guerilla Wrestling Club and is expected to lead a Byron program that has been front runner for the sport of girls wrestling. Eighth-grader Kenadee Bartel is another youngster to keep an eye on this year.

Olivia Martinez Mayo

Martinez will be household name in a couple of months. She was a NYWA Youth Wrestling state champ as a sixth-grader back in March. Coach Art Trimble is expecting big things from her as well as a girls program that is becoming one of the largest in the area.

Madilyn Grabau Pine Island

Grabau reached the Section 1-2 semifinals where she fell to eventual state runner-up McKenna Hendrickson of Grand Meadow. The then seventh-grader went on to place fourth at 132 and finished with 22 wins a year ago.

Eliana Callies Century

In her first year of the sport Callies placed fifth at sections as just a sophomore. She is a part of a wrestling family as she is the younger sister of two-time state qualifier Byron Callies who graduated last year and the older sister of Gabrien and Keon. Odds are she put in some good work this past off-season.

Evangelene Chittanavong John Marshall

The mixed martial arts specialist is as tough as nails and will once again wrestle for JM's boys team slotted in at 114. She finished third at sections a year ago with pins in her final two matches of the season. She is a contender for a state berth in the girls tournament if that's the route she chooses.

Grace Finley Chatfield

Finley was going to wait to come out for the sport but was convinced to come out mid-way through the season. It ended up being the right decision. She placed fifth at 145 at the section meet last year as a freshman. She reached the semifinals where she fell to Lake City senior Emma Hofschulte. She responded with a pin in the fifth-place match."

This is what childhood dreams are made of.

Simply Recipes / Sarah Crowder

In the late 1980s Pillsbury single-handedly rendered plain cake obsolete for kids across America by introducing Funfetti cake mix a white cake with multicolored sprinkles in the batter not merely for decorating the top. It quickly emerged as the cake that defines childhood. And while Pillsbury has trademarked the name Funfetti it has become synonymous with colorful sprinkles much like Band-Aid is for adhesive bandages.

Sarah Crowder our art director and a child of the '80s and '90s echoes this sentiment. ""I grew up loving Funfetti cake but none of those formative experiences involved a homemade cake. To me a confetti cake is boxed cake. It’s the rare example where instead of the boxed mix trying to emulate homemade all of the recipes to make confetti cake at home are trying their hardest to replicate the flavor of the mixes.""

It was Sarah who proposed that Simply Recipes undertake a confetti cake taste test to find the best brand. Perhaps she needed a sprinkle of joy and nostalgia in her day. Our team of editors was happy to oblige because this is what childhood dreams are made of.

The 6 Brands of Confetti Boxed Cake Mix We Taste Tested

Here are the six brands of confetti boxed cake mixes we blindly tasted and compared to find our favorites. These are the brands I can find at my local grocery stores (Target Harris Teeter Kroger and Whole Foods) and they are available nationwide.



All of the cakes were baked following the instructions on the box. To make it fair and square we taste-tested the cakes blindly—none of the editors knew which brand of cake they were tasting. We evaluated the cakes for flavor texture color the quality and quantity of sprinkles and whether they would be easy to frost without crumbling.

The Perfect One: Duncan Hines Joyfetti Confetti Cake Mix

Let me start by saying that I would never yuck someone else's yum. If you have a particular brand of confetti cake mix that brings you joy and reminds you of going to Blockbuster with your BFF and feeding your Tamagotchi by all means that's the box you should continue buying. Food memories are worth preserving.

For everyone else our team of editors unanimously voted that Duncan Hines Joyfetti Confetti Cake Mix is the best. The texture is light and fluffy it has a delicate and delicious real butter flavor and it smells like what I imagine Candy Land would smell like on a sunny day. The cake was sweet but not cloyingly which means you can slather on frosting liberally.

It's worth mentioning this cake contains a lot of green and red sprinkles which makes it look Christmas-themed. It did not deter us from enjoying the cake. This is the only brand of boxed confetti cake we'd buy for birthday parties school bake sales and cravings.

The Best Gluten-Free Confetti Cake: King Arthur

We included gluten-free brands in our taste test because Simply Recipes readers frequently ask for this option in our recipes. Luckily there are great gluten-free products at grocery stores these days including our top pick for the best gluten-free confetti cake: King Arthur Gluten-Free Confetti Cake Mix.

This cake is moist and would be delicious with a vanilla-forward frosting. The texture is slightly grainy and chewier than a classic cake made with flour because the batter contains rice flour and tapioca starch. Because King Arthur uses plant-based ingredients—spirulina annatto turmeric beta carotene and vegetable juice—to color the sprinkles they aren't as vibrant. If you're looking for a confetti cake that uses natural food colors this one's for you.



So how did Sarah fare after eating multiple slices of cake? You can see for yourself:

Known in polite circles as quick service restaurants the fast food sector is proving resilient in times of consumer stress.

But the latest sales results from the listed exemplars show the franchises need to tread warily when it comes to supersizing profits at the expense of customers.

This week Colonel Sanders’ local foot soldier Collins Foods (ASX:CKF) revealed local same-store sales growth of 2.9 per cent in the first six weeks of its second half (from Oct 16).

Given first half sales grew 6.6 per cent there’s been some softening – probably because of interest rates – but nothing to frighten the henhouse too much.

Domino’s Pizza Enterprises (ASX:DMP) in early November reported similar local like-for-like growth of 2.7 per cent.

Collins owns 270 of the brand’s 750 chicken joints (mainly in Queensland and WA).

Globally KFC is owned by the $54 billion New York listed Yum! Brands (formerly Pepsico) which also owns Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.

With 3800 stores Domino’s Pizza Enterprises accounts for half of the Australian market and has the rights to Belgium France the Netherlands Japan Germany Luxembourg Taiwan Malaysia Singapore and Cambodia.

Collins Foods runs Taco Bell here and has KFC rights in Germany and the Netherlands.

At Domino’s August full-year results CEO Don Meij admitted the chain had scared customers away by increasing prices to compensate for sharply higher input costs.

The company hastily removed a new delivery charge and made changes to its menu in favour of the cheaper lines.

By the time of the early November Meij had regained his mojo pointing to “materially higher” December-half earnings after a poor 2022-23 year. He also notes an uptake in higher-quality pizzas as an affordable treat when household budgets are stressed.

Collins Foods is determined not to emulate Domino’s pricing misstep adopting a “conservative approach to pricing centred on maintaining affordability.”

The company seemed to get the balance right with first-half revenue climbing 14 per cent (to $696 million) and underlying profit rosing 29 per cent (to $31.2m).

The fast food sector’s reliability is reflected in the dominant position of private equity players – who are always quick to sniff out a sure thing – in the byzantine ownership structures.

PAG Asia Capital owns Oporto and Craveable Brands which in turn owns Red Rooster.

The private equity and super fund backed Guzman y Gomez recently dusted off plans to list the fast-growing chain but like a jalafuego jalapeno the asking price was too spicy for investors.

An alternative is the lesser-known ASX and NZ-listed Restaurant Brands NZ (ASX:RBD) which has the Kiwi dibs on KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell and owns 75 KFC outlets in NSW (as well as 75 in California).

Majority owned by private equity Restaurant Brands reported September quarter same-store Australian sales growth of 13 per cent with mall and CBD trade recovering to near pre-Covid levels.

All in all the big chains are shrugging off new competition from hundreds of gourmet burger shops or ethnic-themed offerings such as Roll’d (Vietnamese) or Korean Fried Chicken (yep – the other KFC).

Domino’s faces a potential threat as Pizza Hut seeks to reclaim its previous market leading position under new ownership (Flynn Restaurant Group of the US this year acquired the local rights from private equiteer Allegro).

Collins Foods shares have climbed more than fourfold since listing in 2011 and has a reliable dividend-paying record.

Having listed at $2.50 per share in 2005 and now trading at above $50 Domino’s has made plenty of dough for its shareholders.

Domino’s stock trades perennially on a fancy multiple but hiccups aside the company’s earnings growth ends up justifying the valuation.

Ford patents pedestrian safety tech: Here's how the 'inflatable bumpers' will save lives

Ford Motor Company has filed a patent for its new pedestrian safety technology which involves inflatable bumpers. The technology will be introduced in Ford's large SUVs and trucks to protect pedestrians from serious injuries in accidents. The system deploys the bumpers immediately after sensing an impact similar to airbags. Ford filed the patent for this technology after patenting shapeshifting bumpers. The new system will have two bumpers one in the front fascia and another beneath it to protect pedestrians' knees and prevent them from going underneath the vehicle.

HYDERABAD: The city is becoming increasingly unsafe for pedestrians  with fatalities in road accidents increasing over the years.Road accidents data with ministry of road transport shows that Hyderabad recorded as many as 782 pedestrian accidents in 2022 in which 123 persons were killed and 568 injured. What is even more concerning is that fatalities involving pedestrians have been on rise in the city in the last three years.Data shows that in 2020 72 pedestrians were killed in road accidents. This figure climbed to 94 in 2021 and 123 in 2022. In four years i.e. between 2019 and 2022 a total of 384 pedestrians were killed in the city.Road safety experts point out that a majority of city roads were designed with no safety measures for pedestrians. They say removal of U-turns is also forcing motorists to travel in the wrong direction.“Our roads are meant for 30 to 35 categories of vehicles but there are no proper markings and zebra crossings for pedestrians. Footpaths were laid in some parts of the city just for beautification without following safety specifications. There are hardly any pelican signals and police and civic authorities do not create any awareness about them” said Vinod Kanumala from Indian Federation of Road Safety.Pedestrian deaths were not confined to just Hyderabad as the state too witnessed over 1458 fatalities last year.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Stocks are heading into year-end on a hot streak with the S&P 500 rising nearly 9% through November alone putting the index up about 19% year-to-date.

That's a far-cry from where many Wall Street pros thought stocks would end the year. Back in January the market's consensus was that a recession was inevitable as interest rate hikes would cut into corporate profits while demolishing consumer's wallets.
