You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years and go directly to read Dividend Challengers List Ranked By Yield: Top 10.

Dividend Challengers are companies that have raised their dividends for five years or more. These companies tend to have strong financials and are often viewed as more mature than non-dividend-paying companies. Moreover they are likely to continue growing their payouts in the future and can be a reliable investment option for risk-averse investors. Examples of popular dividend stocks that have rewarded investors with decades-long dividend growth include The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) and A. O. Smith Corporation (NYSE:AOS).

With the growing risks of a global recession dividend stocks are taking the spotlight as these securities have helped investors through previous periods of economic decline. According to a report by Charles Schwab high-dividend stocks outperformed the overall market in every recessionary bear market of the past 50 years except for the financial crisis of 2008-2009 when companies were made to slash their payouts. The same report also highlighted the importance of diversified portfolios with securities scattered through various sectors.

When evaluating dividend stocks investors should be aware of some potential risks so that they can make more informed investment decisions. Companies with relatively high payout ratios are more vulnerable to a dividend cut. On the other hand companies that have consistently raised their dividends have solid cash flow generation which makes them more committed to shareholder obligation. As many companies showed confidence in their sufficient cash flow dividend spending is likely to increase this year as well. In 2022 companies in the S&P 500 distributed approximately $561 billion in dividends reaching their highest amount on record. Given the above discussion we will further elaborate on Dividend Challengers in this article.

“VICI Properties Inc. (NYSE:VICI) is a real estate investment trust company specializing in casinos and other entertainment properties. We invested in VICI in 2018 when earnings were declining due to dilutive acquisitions. Our thesis was that as investors grew more comfortable with casinos as a REIT subsector the value of their properties would increase. We also liked the defensive characteristics of the company specifically the triple-net lease structure which dictates that lessees pay all maintenance and capital expenditures and the history of casino REITs with zero rent payments missed by casinos during either the global financial crisis or the 2020 pandemic. Furthermore we were confident that VICI’s growth prospects would increase as more casinos monetized land holdings with VICI’s ability to use its extensive cash and liquidity to make acquisitions. VICI’s stock outperformed in the quarter due to its appeal as a fairly defensive investment and the news that it would be included in the S&P 500 Index. We maintained our position in VICI.”

Abbott issues disaster declaration for Texas counties impacted by ice storm,"TEXAS (CBSDFW.COM/AP) — Governor Greg Abbott issued a disaster declaration for Texas counties impacted by this past week's ice storm.

The disaster declaration includes Denton Hays Henderson Milam Smith Travis and Williamson Counties—all of which experienced power outages widespread property damage and hazardous travel disruptions.

In a statement released Saturday afternoon the governor said he will continue to ensure communities will have the resources and support they need to recover.

""Through this disaster declaration we will be able to provide additional assistance to Texans and communities who have experienced property damage and localized power outages from this ice storm.""

Gov. Abbott also encourages Texans to report damages to the iSTAT damage survey so that the state can meet ""all needs in the recovery process.""

Hays Travis and Williamson Counties have been hit particularly hard as some Austin residents are still without power Saturday.

Some residents say they're frustrated that no answers are being offered as to when their electricity will return.

""There's just no communication from (Austin Energy) about when we're going to get help"" said Christy Kale who lives in south Austin.

""There are elderly people"" in the neighborhood Kale said. ""Children people who need medical equipment it's just wrong"" that no one with the energy company will say when power is expected to be restored.

Officials with Austin Energy did not immediately return phone calls for comment on Saturday.

The energy company's website said crews were working around the clock ""through complicated repairs to restore power to customers.""

The company said power may return intermittently as work continued to repair the system.

Both Kale and fellow south Austin resident Greta Olivas said they have been unable since Friday to speak by phone with a person when trying to contact the power provider for the city of nearly 1 million people Austin Energy.

Both also said they just want to know when to expect power to return.

""If I had an answer if it was 'Oh there's an area with bigger problems it's going to take the weekend (before power is restored)'...we would know what to do...we could go to a hotel"" Olivas said.

Statewide the number of outages had fallen to below 125000 on Saturday down from a peak of 430000 customers without power on Thursday.

Saudi Arabia will once again serve as the backdrop for the four-day event from February 6 to 9 which is expected to draw over 120000 participants from all corners of the world.

During the first edition of LEAP around 100000 visitors travelled to Riyadh to explore cutting-edge technologies and visionary strategies that can help shape the future of government business and society.

The event brought together more than 500 CEOs and executives expert speakers 700 exhibiting companies and 330 investors – with the aim of building breakthrough partnerships. During the event over $6.4 billion worth of initiatives and programs were announced.

Hosted by Informa Tech the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology and the Saudi Federation for Cybersecurity Programming and Drones LEAP 2023 (themed ‘Into New Worlds’) is on track to smash last year’s records (which already earned LEAP the title of ‘the most successful debut tech event in history’) with over 700 speakers and 400 sessions lined up for the expected 120000-strong crowd.

“Technology and innovation have enormous potential to transform economies and societies. We live in a time where you either leap or be left behind. We are proud to host LEAP to help the region lead and leapfrog with technology and innovation” said H.E. Abdullah Alswaha Minister of Communications and Information Technology of Saudi Arabia.

“LEAP is a worldwide gathering of futurists pioneers investors business leaders policymakers and tech enthusiasts from a wide range of fields who discuss the breakthrough work and the biggest socio-cultural challenges of the world – with technology at the centre of these developments” he added.

Meanwhile more than 500 investors will be present to connect with the 400+ start-ups and scale-ups present on the exhibition floor.

“Looking around the exhibition floor here at LEAP there are so many incredible hard-to-believe and inspiring innovations. I’ve been to a lot of conferences and conventions around the world and this really feels like it’s in a class of its own” said Steven Bartlett a serial investor on the BBC One show Dragons’ Den who attended the inaugural event in February.

LEAP’s consulting partners

The LEAP conference is supported by an ecosystem of 50 or so partners and among them are some of the world’s household names in consulting. One of the event’s top sponsors IBM (including subsidiary IBM Consulting) is a so-called Strategic Sponsor (up with the likes of Aramco and Microsoft) while Tech Mahindra is one of the Bronze Sponsors.

Four of the world’s largest consultancies have been tapped to shape LEAP’s agenda across topics. PwC is the event’s overall Digital Consulting Partner while Deloitte has been named Innovation & Emerging Technology Partner. Notably EY and KPMG are not part of the consulting partner roster although they do have a delegation of experts among the speaker and panelist line-up.

Accenture is on board for arguably the event’s most futuristic and hyped topic: the metaverse. Appointed the official Metaverse Partner Accenture has been at the forefront of the development both externally as well as internally.

US-headquartered strategy consultancy Boston Consulting Group is also a partner putting forward its recently launched BCG X division as LEAP’s preferred Tech Build and Design Partner. Rival strategy giant McKinsey & Company has a broader remit. LEAP’s official Knowledge Partner the firm’s experts will inform leaders and participants on many of the strategic and technology topics discussed at the event.

Devoteam which has a particularly strong presence in the Saudi market has been named the Digital Transformation Partner of LEAP.

For all eight consultancies LEAP comes within a month of their role at the prestigious World Economic Forum (WEF) in the Swiss city of Davos. All except Tech Mahindra and Devoteam are in fact among the WEF’s Global Strategic Partners – a privilege given to just 100 globally-operating companies.

Vision 2030

LEAP forms an integral part of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 ambition to become a head-to-toe player in technology promoting 5G artificial intelligence 3D printing robotics fintech biotechnology and the internet of things and supporting the development of a thriving startup ecosystem.

For these reasons adobe architecture is as much emblematic of the state’s dual Hispanic/Indigenous heritages and conflicts. It is a rare medieval history for a state being ruins of a vanished era and a folkart of rustic craftsmanship. Adobe construction dates back 4000 years to Middle Egyptian when the word was pronounced TOW-bee which made its way into Arabic as at-TOW-boo then via the Moors into Spanish as ad-DOE-bee.

Since 1492 colonial Spain claimed a massive empire of 5.3 million square miles much of it unexplored. It was held in order to prevent British Russian French and American claims or settlements. While Alta California was of little military importance its Central Coast was needed to protect Spain’s Manila galleon trade route with Asia. Unable to recruit enough settlers for so remote a location it was decided to convert the Indigenous population into loyal Spanish citizens.

Adobe recipe

A series of Franciscan missions would teach Catholicism and Spanish labor. It was planned that each mission would close after 10 years and the land apportioned to the Indigenous for ranchos. The first mission was established 1769 in San Diego a semi-arid climate for which adobe-brick architecture was ideally suited. As a desert architecture the more the adobe bakes in the sun the stronger it gets.

One of the leading architects to revive this art form is Gil Sanchez of Scotts Valley learning the traditional way plus conservation strategies. He has helped preserve such landmarks as Santa Cruz’s School Street Adobe Mission San Juan Bautista Monterey’s La Casa Amesti and San Jose adobes among others. Two of his students James Delgado and Chrisopher Wade wrote the 1978 pamphlet “How California Adobes Were Built in the 1830s.”

Adobe brick is made by filling a pit with water and clay then stomping and mixing the lumps into a thick paste. Next sand and straw are mixed in as a binder to keep the bricks from cracking or falling apart. Then this slurry is poured into square wooden framing molds usually 4 inches by 11 inches by 22 inches. After setting for a half-hour the mold is removed and the bricks set on end to dry in the hot sun for about 30 days.

A trench is filled with round foundation stones then capped with a thick coat of mud as a foundation for the walls. Door and window openings are spanned with a squared lintel log and lacking glass the windows had bars to keep out wild animals with hides or blankets in the evening to keep out the cold. Finally seashells are baked into lime which was mixed with sand and water to create lime plaster. This plaster covered every exterior surface as a sealant. Finally the dirt floor is smoothed and ox-blood poured on it drying to a hard surface.

The second California mission was 1770 in Carmel named Mission San Carlos. Those attempting to build the same desert architecture in Monterey Bay found a moister climate than in Southern California.

Difficulties

In 1791 the Spanish chose a spot beside the San Lorenzo River about where San Lorenzo Lumber is today to found Alta California’s 12th Mission: Santa Cruz. In those days River Street was on the shore of the San Lorenzo River. We can learn a lot from how difficult it was to maintain a mission in Santa Cruz both physically and emotionally. In the autumn of 1791 the mission was constructed of split-log palisades rammed in the earth and covered with a thatched roof. This architecture was not unfamiliar to the Indigenous people who built open-air ramadas of log pillars supporting lintels and a thatched roof.

But the mission barely lasted three months as its proximity to the San Lorenzo River saw it washed away in a winter flood. They rebuilt the mission near the bluff of Mission Hill but in the storm of 1792 the bluff collapsed destroying the mission a second time. There were rumors of Indigenous hostilities plotted against the Spanish but no confirmation.

Once again the padres sought to rebuild the mission. Only this time they placed it on top of Mission Hill constructed of adobe bricks. But it wasn’t the best fit since one couldn’t build with mud bricks directly on the ground or the adobe would wick-up the water and disintegrate the bricks from within. Monterey was the provincial capital of Alta California and learned on this bay adobe construction needed a chalk-rock stone foundation rising several feet above the ground on top of which were placed the adobe bricks.

Santa Cruz’s Mission Hill location was only rejected for lacking a water supply. So workmen united three springs near today’s university entrance known as Tres Ojos de Agua. They dug a ditch or “zanja” down High Street running through the Mission Plaza to cascade over the bluff at the end of School Street. The chapel’s cornerstone was laid on Feb. 27 to construct a building 29 feet wide 25 feet tall 112 feet long with walls 5 feet thick. Roof beams 29 feet tall were transported with difficulty to the Mission Hill site and raised to support the chapel’s flat roof. A two-story granary and House of Looms were completed that year. In order to carve some bas-relief decoration into the entrance to the mission chapel the facade was constructed of “chalk-rock” sandstone from an Eastside quarry at the foot of Water Street hill.

Yet before the adobe mission chapel was even dedicated the first revolt against the mission occurred in December. Then in 1794 the mission chapel was dedicated May 10. That year the English explorer George Vancouver visited the mission to acquire supplies and traded hardware for a grist-mill. This was such important machinery that two millstones were crafted in Santa Cruz the other being for Santa Clara. The mill was constructed on Laurel Street bluff (now Babbling Brook site).

However the padres were not pleased with the construction of the adobe mission complex believing the sailors didn’t know what they were doing and should be sent back to the San Francisco presidio. Still they completed the last of the Mission Hill buildings in 1795. To the west of the Mission chapel was the padre’s quarters in back of which was a courtyard with crafts workshops. To the east of the chapel graveyard was a Men and Boys dormitory with the “Pest House” east of it on Adobe Street. South of this wing was a two-story “Nunnery” for women and girls at the corner of Emmet and School streets east of which were the married apartments.

Yet possibly proving out the assessment of the sailors the mill was badly damaged in the winter storm of 1796 the Chapel was damaged in the storm of 1797 crops were flooded in the storm of 1798 and the January storm of 1799 damaged the Chapel Mission buildings and grist mill. And it wasn’t just the padres showing discontent. The system of punishments upset the Indigenous people creating uprisings and escapes in 1796 1797 and 1798. The flat roof of the Mission Chapel had the unfortunate tendency to pool storm waters into a rooftop lake which collapsed the roof. So a gable roof was built on top to shed the water while the flat ceiling in the chapel was repaired.

The Hand of God

Then in 1800 came the Hand of God a year of both drenching rains then between Oct. 11-31 earthquakes sometimes six per day the most severe being on Oct. 18. Cracks appeared in the ground most adobe walls cracked top-to-bottom threatening to fall over. Padres Domingo Corranza and Francisco Gonzales were so terrified they spent nights outdoors in carts. A very deep fissure formed on the banks of the Pajaro River. Then a British-looking ship appeared in the bay near the Salinas River producing rumors of a possible pirate invasion. Yet the rain did produce the mission’s largest bumper crop ever.

In 1802 a hurricane tore the roofs off the San Francisco Presidio buildings. Then came the winter of 1804-05 when gales driving rain and strong winds tore apart fragile structures. Then in June and July 1808 the fort in San Francisco was destroyed by 18 severe earthquakes while in 1809-10 storms finished up the destruction. In 1811 the mission added red clay tiles to prevent Indigenous revolutionaries from setting the thatch on fire. In 1818 Argentina’s pirates showed up the same year Santa Clara had a terrible earthquake.

Then in 1824 the worst rains since 1800 hit Santa Cruz damaging gardens mission buildings and collapsing the poorly built residential wing which had to be replaced with an entirely new School Street adobe. On top of all this the unpaid soldiers revolted.

In 1840 the chapel was trying to sell its roof tiles piling them at Beach Flats awaiting sales to a commercial ship. Then an earthquake hit which toppled the mission tower. In addition it triggered a tsunami which washed away the roof tiles from the shore. Finally the facade fell off the Mission Chapel in the late 1850s and the Chapel was enclosed behind a wooden facade and used as a stable for the padre’s livestock.

So to review the adobe chapel was damaged about a dozen times from 1791 to 1857. Only four adobes remain in Santa Cruz County: the School Street Adobe the Castro Adobe State Historic Park on Old Adobe Road in Watsonville the Bolcoff Adobe at Wilder Ranch State Park and the privately owned Craig-Lorenzana Adobe.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vbGlnaHRyb29tLWNhbGlicmF0aW9uLXRvb2wtd2hhdC1ob3cv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Is the Calibration Tool in Adobe Lightroom?

Whether live streaming producing videos or starting a podcast you might feel that your hardware isn't up to scratch. Especially if you compare yourself to those who turn a fun hobby into a successful career it's easy to assume you need a high-end mic coupled with a desk full of expensive accessories but is there really anything wrong with a standard USB-powered microphone?

I've used many desktop mics in my career and personal life and there's some truth to the value of premium hardware but a recent trend has made things so much easier for newcomers with the power of AI. You could sit and read through my ramblings about polar patterns sample range and bit depth but only a select few people genuinely care about that. Besides those interested in the specifics aren't letting others dictate which microphone they should buy nor should you.

⚠️⚠️Stop gatekeeping microphones⚠️⚠️

Some recent Twitter discourse featured wildly misguided information about USB microphones specifically the Blue Yeti one of my all-time favorite options that served me well for over a decade. I'm sure this Twitter user had good intentions since they followed up with some explanations and recommendations — still the slander against my cherished multi-pattern USB mic sparked a heated debate among creators.

there is absolutely nothing wrong with the Blue Yeti.it's a fantastic USB microphone offering high-quality audio with minimal effort. HILARIOUS to describe it as bad.I get why people 'graduate' to XLR but lmao stop this microphone gatekeeping BS. buy whatever mic you want. https://t.co/WVUod2C8ANJanuary 30 2023

A huge benefit to working in tech is getting hands-on with new hardware for review but I'm unlikely to shake the frugal lifestyle from my youth. I hate spending money; there's no getting around it. In 2010 I wanted to upgrade from a bargain-basement 3.5mm microphone connected to an unshielded port on a terrible motherboard so I opted for the USB-powered Blue Yeti after weeks of agonizing debate.

The original silver-colored Yeti still works today albeit with a slightly wonky volume knob caused by an accidental drop. Whoops. We were even gifted a second Yeti for my partner in 2020 since we usually shared the original between us and that's when you start to notice one of the only downsides to USB mics: desynchronization.

Ports on your motherboard inherently restrict USB audio devices and two devices are never guaranteed to be aligned perfectly during recordings. It is possible to calculate the necessary milliseconds of delay and fix it with some tweaks to record group podcasts with multiple USB mics but it's rarely a permanent fix. Still it's understandable to feel frustrated when things could be better out of the box and some users expect studio-quality playback with zero effort.

Enhance your livestream audio for $0

Most USB microphones offer a relatively flat response in their recordings utterly unaffected by post-processing. Some fancier models might have built-in noise reduction or other enhancements but even basic variants can mimic premium alternatives with a few simple plugins without spending a dime. If you're planning to broadcast your audio in a live setting OBS Studio is a free app for Windows and it's my favorite option for streaming and recording all kinds of other content.

There is a collection of free audio filters pre-installed on OBS Studio with plenty more community-made options available around the web. You can solve almost any microphone issue with at least one of these plugins ultimately combining them to find the perfect balance for your mic. For example a noise suppressor helps reduce unwanted background sounds; which is ideal if you're running air conditioning on a hot day or your desktop PC is close enough to hear the case fans.

If you're a quiet speaker you don't need a specific microphone designed for hushed or feminine tones just a simple compressor. Not every problem needs solving by throwing cash at your screen and you shouldn't blindly take advice from anyone gatekeeping a category of hardware. It'll take at least one afternoon of studying to learn how to use audio filters to their best effect but a quick search immediately finds a massive collection of helpful tutorials on YouTube.

Adobe Podcast — hack your mic quality

Adobe Podcast might be in a closed beta but the best tools are already secretly available. (Image credit: Adobe)

It's a wild scenario when Adobe of all companies is leading the way with a free audio-enhancing tool. The same Adobe who priced me out of all their software and drove me to open-source alternatives somehow managed to create one of the most useful web-based plugins I've ever used in its Adobe Podcast beta (formerly Project Shasta.)

Inherently designed to simplify the podcast recording process Adobe is working on a straightforward app to replace complicated mixers and post-processing edits. Think of it like a virtual conference meeting where everyone can join a web-based audio chat room; only this time the host can save the whole session and generate a professional finished product with barely any effort.

Using the same technology from its Adobe Premiere Pro software recordings will automatically transcribe the speech to text ready to edit as a script instead of cutting up complex audio waveforms. It all sounds fantastic but the best part is the AI-powered Enhance Speech tool which Adobe has already released sneakily hidden in a small drop-down menu.

If you're editing videos podcast episodes or interviews to post online later the Enhance Speech tool from Adobe is perfect. It'll remove background noise and make your speech sound like it's being recorded with professional equipment. Even with a $10 lavalier microphone I can supercharge the recordings with this free tool and nobody would ever know it initially sounded like trash.

An ethical future for AI?

Whether you're streaming live speech or recording it for later use there are some seriously impressive methods to improve the quality of any microphone. No matter which variant you can afford there are advancements in this vague and ever-evolving AI category to augment your audio depending on your interpretation of the term. Just because I 'graduated' to the so-far-unbeatable Earthworks Audio Ethos XLR mic doesn't mean you should avoid USB models.

Above all I won't stand for slander against my precious Blue Yeti. That little silver-coated trooper served me well for over a decade and saw me earn paid narration work after some mild post-processing cleanup. You could do far worse than the number-one-selling USB microphone from Blue no matter how you feel about Logitech's eventual ownership. Other variants might have taken its place as the best streaming microphone but there's never been anything wrong with the Yeti.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMinAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zZGNleGVjLmNvbS9zb3VyY2luZy1wcm9jdXJlbWVudC9wcm9qZWN0LW1hbmFnZW1lbnQtc29mdHdhcmUvYXJ0aWNsZS8yMjY0NDc0NC9sb2dpd2EtZGF0YS11c2UtYW5kLW1lYXN1cmVtZW50cy10by1vcHRpbWl6ZS13YXJlaG91c2UtcGVyZm9ybWFuY2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Data Use and Measurements to Optimize Warehouse Performance,"As the dust settles on the 2022 peak season and the new year begins it’s time to evaluate the performance of fulfillment operations. Almost every brand or third-party logistics (3PL) provider needs to improve efficiency increase savings and better serve customers. With the right data and key performance indicators (KPIs) you can measure the performance of business and the impact on profit margin.

A warehouse management system (WMS) is a critical tool in running an efficient digital fulfillment network. An intelligent WMS provides a vast amount of data that unlocks valuable insights into your operations so it’s important to determine which metrics to track closely. Otherwise business may never reap the benefit of your data’s insights.

Why track WMS KPIs?

Knowing what information to measure is essential to run a business effectively. When thinking about warehouse KPIs it’s all about products and stock. KPIs can include inventory accuracy shrinkage carrying cost of inventory inventory turnover and inventory-to-sales ratio. Keeping an eye on supply chain KPIs relevant to your operations can help you understand and improve your warehouse efficiency

Here’s a look at a few key metrics and how they benefit warehouse operations:

Receiving and putaway KPIs. Time is the top receiving KPI in the industry. “Dock-to-stock” time is a critical component to track closely. The length of time it takes to get items off a truck and onto a shelf affects the entire supply chain. Understanding receiving and putaway KPIs highlights where receiving processes are strong and where improvements are needed.

Within the receiving and putaway categories these are also important to track:

Receiving efficiency. Receiving efficiency tracks the health of the receiving area. As warehouse staff becomes more experienced receiving efficiency will increase. If your numbers are on a downward trend it may be time to re-examine the receiving process. You can calculate this metric by dividing inventory received by the number of staff hours worked.

Receiving efficiency tracks the health of the receiving area. As warehouse staff becomes more experienced receiving efficiency will increase. If your numbers are on a downward trend it may be time to re-examine the receiving process. You can calculate this metric by dividing inventory received by the number of staff hours worked. Receiving cycle time . This metric measures the processing time of newly received merchandise into the warehouse. If your receiving cycle time is lengthy this can signal that your receiving process needs improving. Receiving cycle time can be calculated as total time spent on processing newly received stock divided by total number of received items.

Receiving cycle time can be calculated as total time spent on processing newly received stock divided by total number of received items. Putaway accuracy. The putaway KPI tracks how accurately employees get items on the shelf by measuring the ratio of correct putaways to total putaways. The goal is to have inventory put away correctly the first time every time. If this KPI isn’t consistently measuring at 100% search for patterns in putaway errors that could indicate learned mistakes or product mix-ups

The goal is to have inventory put away correctly the first time every time. If this KPI isn’t consistently measuring at 100% search for patterns in putaway errors that could indicate learned mistakes or product mix-ups Putaway cycle time . The average amount of time needed to store one item from inventory is known as the putaway cycle time. The typical format for this metric is dividing the time spent on putaway by the total number of items in a putaway task.

. The average amount of time needed to store one item from inventory is known as the putaway cycle time. The typical format for this metric is dividing the time spent on putaway by the total number of items in a putaway task. Shipping KPIs. This category measures order cycle time or how long it takes an order to ship once it has been placed. The less time spent on this process the better. If order cycle times are on the higher end there may be issues with picking packing or shipping workflows.

Within the shipping category these are important to track:

On-time shipping rate . On-time shipping rate indicates performance on sending out orders on time or in advance. This KPI can be a good gauge to look at when assessing SLAs and planning labor for a given day. Calculate this metric by dividing the number of orders that have been shipped on time or in advance by the total number of orders shipped.

Calculate this metric by dividing the number of orders that have been shipped on time or in advance by the total number of orders shipped. Total order cycle time. Total order cycle time calculates the time it takes a customer to place an order until the time it ships. This includes all intermediate steps such as downloading the order picking items packing them and preparing them for shipping.

Total order cycle time calculates the time it takes a customer to place an order until the time it ships. This includes all intermediate steps such as downloading the order picking items packing them and preparing them for shipping. Storage. Storage KPIs give insights into the costs of keeping products on shelves. These KPIs are necessary to monitor especially inventory carrying cost which indicates how much it costs to store inventory. Storing inventory ties up capital so you want to keep this metric as low as possible. Calculate it by dividing your total carrying costs by overall inventory costs.

Another important storage related KPI is backorder rate which measures unfulfilled warehouse orders. In a perfect world this number would be zero but this metric depends on how quickly shelves can be restocked. This is calculated by total backorders divided by total number of orders:

Inventory turnover. Inventory turnover measures how frequently inventory is sold in a given period and can be calculated by dividing total sales by average inventory. Higher values indicate stronger sales while lower values highlight weaker sales.

Inventory turnover measures how frequently inventory is sold in a given period and can be calculated by dividing total sales by average inventory. Higher values indicate stronger sales while lower values highlight weaker sales. Shrinkage. Shrinkage inventory is a KPI used to track inventory losses from human error misplaced items theft supplier fraud and receiving inaccuracy. Shrinkage is calculated by identifying any discrepancies between recorded inventory and actual physical inventory.

Shrinkage is calculated by identifying any discrepancies between recorded inventory and actual physical inventory. Picking KPIs. Many customers order items online because they’re searching for a particular product and know precisely what they want. Receiving the wrong item is not only frustrating for customers but also expensive for the business. Improving order picking productivity and accuracy will lower costs and create happier customers.

WMS solutions help organize and accurately keep track of inventory by improving picking and packing processes. An intelligent WMS can reduce fulfillment issues caused by human error and provide better insights into available inventory replenishment fulfillment needs and potential inventory issues.

The following are key metrics related to picking performance:

Picking accuracy measures how accurately items are picked for orders.

Picking efficiency averages how many items are picked per hour for a given period. The higher the number the better.

Picking cycle time indicates how long it takes for an order to be picked on average.

Fulfillment accuracy rate is one of the most important KPIs as it shows how accurate operations are to fulfill orders received.

Return process KPIs. Product returns are a reality of direct to consumer sales. Whether someone orders the wrong item receives incorrect or damaged merchandise or the item is simply not to their liking efficiently managing the returns processes minimizes the cost impact to your business.



Within returns the primary KPI to track is the rate of order returns which is calculated by dividing items returned by items sold then multiplying by 100. It’s also important to determine how quickly returned items can be put back on shelves and how quickly the correct product can be delivered to a customer.

Data is your friend not foe

By embracing WMS data you gain rich insights into your fulfillment operations and the ability to measure monitor analyze improve efficiency and costs across the business. All of this is critical to e-commerce success. In today’s competitive landscape high customer expectations and razor thin profit margins require systems that keep supply chain operations highly functional and efficient to meet growing demand. Measuring KPIs enables you to quickly adjust and improve where it is necessary to optimize your business performance.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vdGFnL2FtYXppbmdseS1kaXZlcnNlLXRvdWNoLXRyaWNrcy1waG90b3Nob3Av0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,7 Quick Photoshop Touch-Up Tricks to Enhance Your Photos,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1ha2V1c2VvZi5jb20vdGFnL2FtYXppbmdseS1kaXZlcnNlLXRvdWNoLXRyaWNrcy1waG90b3Nob3Av0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen"

Archrival Advanced Micro Devices is stealing market share in key markets and Intel’s attempts to gain a foothold in mobile devices never gained traction. The last few leadership teams have not been up to the task of managing Intel’s formerly dominant market position — but it’s under new management now.

Current CEO Pat Gelsinger is an engineer at heart with decades of processor design experience. He has a deep understanding of what it takes to produce successful chips in Intel’s target markets his leadership style earns industry-leading reviews from Intel’s workers and the company’s culture is turning back to rewarding innovation.

Ironing out kinks in the design and production process that earlier teams left behind is taking some time due to the semiconductor industry’s lengthy development pipelines and costly chip-making machinery. Gelsinger is now two years into his turnaround efforts and investors should start seeing tangible results within a year or two.

Meanwhile on multiple valuation measures Intel’s stock is trading below its 10-year and five-year averages. On top of that the stock was recently offering a fat dividend yield of 5.2%. Long-term investors might want to take a closer look at Intel. (The Motley Fool owns shares of and has recommended Intel stock and options.)

Ask the Fool

From N.H. Maryville Tenn.: What are “unrealized gains”?

Advertisement

The Fool responds: After you make an investment it will often rise or fall in value giving you a gain or loss. You “realize” the gain or loss when you sell it. Until then it’s “unrealized.”

For example if you bought 100 shares of Buzzy’s Broccoli Beer for $2000 and they’re now worth $3000 you have an unrealized gain of $1000. You might be sitting on huge unrealized gains from some great stocks but until you actually sell the shares you haven’t reaped or realized those gains — and they might shrink (or grow) by the time you sell them.

Unrealized gains are gains in theory only. Another term for them is “paper profits.”

From T.D. Philadelphia: I’m thinking of selling a stock that pays no dividend and a stock that hasn’t grown much since I bought it last year. Would it be worth moving that money into CDs?

Advertisement

The Fool responds: Stocks are arguably the most profitable long-term investments for most people; certificates of deposit with interest rates that have been very low for many years have been best for shorter-term investments. But interest rates have risen recently and some CDs are offering 4.5%. If you don’t think your stocks will do much better than that do consider CDs.

But you might want to hold those stocks if the companies seem to be performing well increasing their revenue and earnings over time. Dividends are terrific but many great companies pay small or no dividends especially if they’re reinvesting profits to further their growth. And lots of strong stocks will head south or be stagnant for a while — especially when the overall market experiences a downturn.

The Fool’s School

Great wealth can be amassed through investments in the stock market but don’t jump in if you don’t know what you’re doing or you don’t have the time skills and inclination to study lots of companies deciding when and if to buy into or sell out of them.

Fortunately there’s an easy — and effective — way to invest in stocks that requires very little time or knowledge: index funds. An index fund is a mutual fund (or an ETF an exchange-traded fund) that tracks a particular index of securities. It holds roughly the same securities as the index does and thereby aims to deliver roughly the same return as the index (minus fees).

So an S&P 500 index fund will track the S&P 500 by holding most or all of the stocks in the index. The S&P 500 includes 500 of America’s biggest companies from Apple and Amazon.com to Campbell Soup and Hasbro. Invest in an S&P 500 index fund and you’ll instantly be a part-owner of hundreds of strong companies with your wealth growing as theirs does.

Many index funds have extremely low fees too so they can perform just about as well as their underlying indexes. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF for example charges just 0.095% annually — or about $9.50 per year for every $10000 you invest in it.

Best of all you won’t sacrifice much performance with index funds: The overall stock market has averaged annual returns close to 10% over many decades (though over a shorter investing period your return is likely to be higher or lower). Over the 20 years ending in the middle of 2022 fully 95% of all U.S. large-cap stock funds underperformed the S&P 500 and over the previous 10 years 90% underperformed. The news isn’t better for smaller companies: Among U.S. small-cap stock funds 94% underperformed their benchmark index (the S&P 600) over the past 20 years.

It’s hard to beat index funds — and you can probably invest in them via your 401(k) or an ordinary brokerage account.

My Dumbest Investment

From B.C. online: My worst investment? I would say poor timing. Like many who have written in I have often sold too soon or held on for the wrong reasons. I have sold shares of Intuitive Surgical Salesforce.com Facebook (now Meta Platforms) and many others way before their time just because they stagnated for a while and I felt the urge to do something. Meanwhile I inherited shares of another stock and I hung on too long out of affection for my grandfather. I guess my lessons are to hold forever if the reason you bought is still true and not to hold a stock for sentimental reasons.

The Fool responds: Those are excellent lessons learned from common mistakes. For best investing results it’s important to learn to manage your emotions. Many people sell in a panic when the stock market drops or buy shares of hot stocks impulsively without considering whether they’re overvalued or sell just because a stock has stalled and they’re impatient for gains.

A quote often attributed to super investor Warren Buffett says: “The trick is when there is nothing to do do nothing.” That’s hard to do but if the company in which you’re invested is chugging along and not facing intractable problems it’s often best to hang on for many years. Patience is another critical investing virtue.

Who Am I?

I trace my roots back to a family-owned wig store in El Paso in 1968. My U.S. business is based there but I now have a headquarters in Bermuda too. With a recent market value near $2.6 billion I’m now a major consumer products company with many familiar brands under my roof such as Braun Drybar Hot Tools Hydro Flask Osprey Oxo Pur and Vicks. I rake in more than $2 billion annually and employ more than 2000 people worldwide. My namesake the beautiful wife of Sparta’s King Menelaus was blamed for starting the Trojan War.

One of the great features that we get is the ability to use an HTML5 iKVM instead of using Java. For all of those admins who had to work through Java prompts for years just to get an iKVM session going HTML5 is simply awesome. In the newer X12 X13 H12 H13 and later generations of systems Supermicro made a change to how remote mounting media works. That means it is time for a quick guide.

How to Add Virtual Media to a Supermicro Server via HTML5 iKVM Web IPMI Interface

If you log into a newer Supermicro server’s IPMI management interface and open the HTML5 iKVM you will see something like this:

The “Virtual Media” menu item that we are familiar with from the Java version is there but it is not available. Supermicro’s newer servers do not let you use this function on the HTML5 browser without a license. It usually still works on the Java browser but the whole point is not to have to use Java. In the newer version of the IPMI firmware you may see this layout instead:

We have an easy and a hard way to get it working. The easy way is to buy SFT-DCMS-SINGLE and then apply the license file. That will allow you to do a traditional virtual media mounting via the browser.

If you have a single server this is a $130-200 license that adds other features but it is the easiest way to get that HTML5 Virtual Media working.

The less expensive way is to mount over a network share. Here we have a QNAP NAS that we have an isos share available. This network share needs to be available from the management network. The below look at the directory is being viewed from a Windows PC with the network share mounted.

On the Supermicro IPMI web interface you will want to navigate to Configuration then Virtual Media on the left-hand menu.

There the two required fields are the host and the path. On the hostname if your NAS has a DNS name of “nas123456” for example you cannot just put “nas123456” in the share host field.

Since one sees “domain” for the field another option one may think of is using a https server with ISO images. That requires a SFT-DCMS-SINGLE or SFT-OOB-LIC license.

That leaves us with an IP address and then a path.

So here we have:

Share Host – IP Address

Path to Image – path on the network share. In this case it is “\isos\ubuntu-20.04.5-live-server-amd64.iso”. Note here if you try “/isos/ubuntu-22.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso” because that is the directory when you are going through the share on linux or “\\isos\ubuntu-22.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso” those will not work. Be careful with the “\”.

Users – This is a username if the share requires it

Password – This is the password if the share requires it. Note there are some characters that you cannot use for example the “?” here. So if the network share by chance has a “?” is the password the Supermicro IPMI will not accept this.

Once that is set the ISO can be mounted using the mount button at the bottom.

Once that is done you should see the ISO mounted up top under “Device 1”.

At that point you can install the OS or drivers as needed.

How to Unmount a Supermicro Virtual Disk

If you want to unmount a Supermicro virtual disk then you will go under Device 1 (pictured below) and on the right side there is a disk with a red “x” image. Click on that and you will get this dialog.

After that the disk should be unmounted. If you forget this step then the system might continue to boot from the virtual media ISO.

BONUS: Supermicro IPMIview 2.0 Works in the Opposite Manner Without Installing Java

Many at STH know we have been using IPMIview 2.0 for a long time. The IPMIview 2.0 program has been one that is known to let you run the Java iKVM client without installing Java and keeping that up-to-date. Given what we showed above many will be surprised to find that IPMIview 2.0 works almost in an opposite way. The Virtual CD-ROM with IPMIview 2.0 requires a license (SFT-DCMS-SINGLE or SFT-OOB-LIC):

However if you utilize the OpenJDK viewer then you can get the remote iKVM and also select virtual media and mount a drive remotely using this.

If you want to mount a local ISO to Supermicro IPMI and do not have a network share reachable by the hosts and do not have a license then using IPMIview 2.0 will allow you to get your job done without a license.

Final Words

It is too bad that this feature is being taken away and hidden behind a paywall with the HTML5 viewer. It is one that previously set Supermicro apart from Dell HPE and Lenovo. While having the current functionality is OK the price point of $130-$200 to get the feature SFT-DCMS-SINGLE for the HTML5 iKVM virtual media feels like a lot if you are not using other features. At least there are alternatives available. Usually we pay $50-75 for a USB drive to get mounted to a server with remote hands in a data center so that is another option if the server’s USB ports are enabled."

The pH values of untreated cysteine solution besides other treated samples with different plasmas are shown in Fig. 2a. The pH value dropped dramatically after TSP treatments. Firstly Ar plasma-treated water without cysteine showed a lower value of pH than untreated cysteine solution (dropped from 4.62 to 4.10). Secondly the pH value of the cysteine solution after Ar + DMSO plasma exposure reached half of that for the untreated sample and reached pH = 2.31. Without DMSO this value became a little bit more than half (pH = 2.45). Finally adding both H 2 O 2 and DMSO resulted in the minimum value of pH = 2.14. This means that the solution has changed to a more acidic medium under the influence of Ar + H 2 O 2 + DMSO plasma than other plasma-treated samples.

Figure 2b shows the comparison UV–Vis spectrum of untreated and plasma-treated cysteine solutions. According to Szili et. al53 UV absorbance contributes to the main long-lived reactive species such as NO 2 – NO 3 – and H 2 O 2 . Increased shoulder in 230–330 nm contributes to H 2 O 2 concentration whereas increased intensity in peak at 190–250 nm contributes to NO 2 – and NO 3 – concentrations. As can be seen adding H 2 O 2 to the plasma led to a high amount of H 2 O 2 concentration. In addition related peaks of NO 2 – and NO 3 – tolerate more intensities after different plasma treatments which were again the highest for Ar + H 2 O 2 + DMSO plasma5455. Finally it can be seen from Fig. 2b that the absorbance of the NO 2 – and NO 3 – and H 2 O 2 in Ar plasma-treated water without cysteine is less than that of the Ar plasma-treated cysteine sample. This indicates that the role of NO 2 – and NO 3 – and H 2 O 2 in absorbance is minor concerning the new products of the Ar plasma-treated cysteine samples.

Interestingly a red-shifted tendency in all cases of plasma treatment was also observed (Ar + H 2 O 2 + DMSO > Ar + DMSO > Ar). According to Ankireddy et. Al.56 the cause of the red-shifted modified peak may be due to the formation of n–π* transitions. The solution decreases the energy state of plasma-derived excited electrons and the red-shifted effect increases by increasing the solution polarity. By the addition of both DMSO and H 2 O 2 through Ar plasma the mentioned wavelength went through a larger wavelength that shows it contains a larger number of mentioned species than others do.

FTIR analysis

For the molecular structures and functional groups of amino acids FTIR analysis has been considered a useful tool. We surveyed FTIR spectra changes in the range of 400–4000 cm−1 to show how different plasmas affect the cysteine solution. All spectra were converted from transmitted spectra to absorption spectra by using the below formula:

$$A = {\text{log}}\left( {\frac{1}{{\text{T}}}} \right)$$

Figure 3 compares the FTIR spectra of untreated and Ar plasma-treated samples with and without the presence of DMSO and H 2 O 2 . Changes in the position and the intensity of peaks have occurred in the presence of plasma for all treated samples.

(Highlighted regions show appearing or disappearing bonds of (green) C–H (yellow) S–H (blue) COO– (pink) S–S and S–O). Full size image

In the range of 2000–4000 cm−1 several bonds such as O–H (3369 cm−1) hydroxyl group stretching vibrations in carboxylic N–H (3243 cm−1) stretching vibration of amine –NH 2 functional group of untreated cysteine solution57 C–H (3149 cm−1) vibration aliphatic C–H (2923 cm−1) for charged amine –NH3+58 S–H thiol group (2553 cm−1) thiol group were detected for untreated cysteine. The S–H bond as the characteristic peak of cysteine disappeared in plasma-treated solutions. Some mentioned bonds were seen with a slightly shifted position in the plasma-treated cases. Chemical bonds in the range of 400–1800 cm−1 also showed several changes. Asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration of COO– (1608 cm−1 and 1390 cm−1) These bonds also changed to 1604 cm−1 and high-intensity peak 1386 cm−1 in the Ar plasma-treated sample and decreased dramatically after adding DMSO and H 2 O 2 596061. The C–S bond (595–830 cm−1)6263 was also detected. After adding DMSO and H 2 O 2 new peaks at (1191 cm−1) (1002 cm−1) and (943 cm−1) respectively related to S=O S–O and S–S were detected. New peaks of (516 cm−1) in Ar + DMSO and (520 cm−1) in Ar + H 2 O 2 + DMSO were also added. These peaks contributed to the S–S bond by more intensity in Ar + DMSO plasma and its absorbance decreased after adding H 2 O 2 in Ar + H 2 O 2 + DMSO.

The intensity of an absorption bond depends on the polarity of the bond. So that a bond with higher polarity will show a more intense absorption bond. The intensity also depends on the number of bonds responsible for the absorption. Moreover the dipole moment base on the chemical impact of plasma treatment of cysteine with high electron density may be the reason for the slight shift in the overall frequencies6465. In other words changes in the electron distribution and hybridization state result in the position of peaks. In FTIR the changes in peak intensity and position usually indicate changes in molecular bonds and functional groups creating some complexes. As a result it is confirmed that the polymerization process has occurred.

Detection of cysteine derivatives under TSP treatment by LCMS/MS analysis

Mass Spectroscopy analysis was done by an Agilent 6410 Triple-Quad mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies Series 1200 Santa Clara CA USA) and a UHPLC system was used to investigate any changes in the chemical structure of cysteine.

Figure 4 shows the mass spectra of untreated and treated samples. As can be seen in all treated cysteine (Fig. 4c–e) many new biomolecules are detected compared to untreated ones (Fig. 4a). The abundance of cysteine based on the bar chart in Fig. 5 followed Raw > Ar > Ar + H 2 O 2 + DMSO > Ar + DMSO. It means Ar + DMSO plasma had the most impact on converting cysteine to other molecules. However other types of plasmas had a great influence on producing new biomolecules.

These peaks are recorded in Table 1 based on their m/z values and their predicted chemical structures are available in the supplementary information. Although some peaks with the same molecular mass have been observed in all three cases of treated cysteine the abundance of these products is different in each of them (Fig. 6). Furthermore some unique chemical products are generated as a result of each plasma treatment that was the most in the Ar + H 2 O 2 + DMSO plasma treatment. Besides the chaining process to create macromolecules each treatment led to degradation and the minimum m/z value was seen for Ar plasma treatment (m/z = 50 Da). For the peaks that were observed in all three treatments they showed the highest abundance as a result of the Ar + DMSO treatment except for (m/z = 347 Da and 102 Da). Interestingly the Ar + H 2 O 2 + DMSO plasma treatment led to generating the biggest product nearly to 1KDa (m/z = 947 Da; C 25 H 38 N 8 O 15 S 8 ) which may be due to the more amount of RONS species.

However the mechanism of plasma chemical reactions in water and their interface reactions are more complex than it seems according to previous studies oxidative stress mainly contributed to the increase in the level of RONS and high reactive radicals such as ·H and ·OH. Several chemical reaction pathways (degradation and polymerization) take place using such radicals66. Mechanisms happening in PAW are not only by the hydrogen atom and OH radical but also by hydrated electrons (e– aq ). Back in the 1980s studies showed that e– aq is produced in water by photons (UV photoexcitation) irradiations with energies more than 6 eV6768. At this energy the formation of e– aq is due to H atom transfer however additional formation is possible at higher energy levels. e– aq derived from generated secondary electrons in water as a result of ionization. These electrons have a great impact on chemistry and biological reactions. See some related reactions below:

$${\text{h}}\upsilon \ + {\text{ H}}_{{2}} {\text{O}} \to {\text{OH }} + {\text{ H}}$$ (1)

$${\text{H }} + {\text{ H}}_{{2}} {\text{O }} \to {\text{ H}}_{{3}} {\text{O}}$$ (2)

$${\text{H}}_{{3}} {\text{O }} \to {\text{ H}}_{{3}} {\text{O}}^{ + } + {\text{ e}}^{ - }_{{{\text{aq}}}}$$ (3)

$${\text{2H}}_{{2}} {\text{O }} + {\text{h}}\upsilon \to {\text{ H}}_{{3}} {\text{O}}^{ + } + {\text{ OH }} + {\text{ e}}^{ - }_{{{\text{aq}}}}$$ (4)

where H 3 O is known as a “Rydberg radical” in which an electron is weakly bound to H 3 O+.

$${\text{H}}_{{2}} {\text{O }} \to {\text{ H }} + {\text{ OH}}$$ (5)

$${\text{e}}^{ - }_{{{\text{aq}}}} + {\text{ H}}_{{2}} {\text{O }} \to {\text{ H }} + {\text{ OH}}^{ - }$$ (6)

$${\text{e}}^{ - }_{{{\text{aq}}}} + {\text{ H}}^{ + } \left( {{\text{or H}}_{{3}} {\text{O}}^{ + } } \right) \ \to {\text{ H }}({\text{or H }} + {\text{ H}}_{{2}} {\text{O}})$$ (7)

For activated water the primary ionization occurs (reaction 1) and a hydrogen atom and OH radical generate as a result of excitation (reaction 2). Reactions (3) and (4) are two important recombination processes in which e– aq converts to the hydrogen atom. Reducing species formed in reaction (1) in their reactions with hydrogen peroxide (8). Finally an exciting water molecule is formed.

$${\text{H }} + {\text{ H}}_{{2}} {\text{O}}_{{2}} \to {\text{ H}}_{{2}} {\text{O }} + {\text{ OH}}$$ (8)

$${\text{H}}_{{2}} {\text{O}}^{ + } + {\text{ e}}^{ - }_{{{\text{aq}}}} \to {\text{ H}}_{{2}} {\text{O}}^{*}$$ (9)

Plasma-generated electrons and various short and long-lived radicals when reaching the solution many mixed reactions occur. As a result of these reactions many other radicals and reactive species generate. Moreover many RONS in PAW is generated by such long (nitrates (NO 3 –) nitrites (NO 2 –) hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and ozone (O 3 )) and short-lived species (hydroxyl radicals (OH·) nitric oxide (NO·) superoxide (O 2 –) peroxynitrite (OONO 2 –) and peroxynitrites (ONOO–))69. Several factors such as the power supply of plasma applied voltage discharge regimes treatment time type of feeding gas and its flow and type and configuration of electrodes besides the solution volume and composition and the distance between the electrode and surface of the solution are important in the efficiency of experiments70. Ar plasma without any molecular gas has high-energy electrons and (V)UV photons7172. The carbonyl group is high in the Ar plasma which causes carbonylation (oxidation process). In addition hydroxyl radicals and atomic and singlet oxygen are shown to be effective on thiol groups in proteins under plasma in situ or ex-situ treatment. The utilization of Ar gas H 2 O 2 and DMSO as the precursors leads to the production of diverse primary species which will subsequently provide for the generation of many secondary species. With dry feed Ar gas plasma ·OH as strong radicals that can oxidize cysteine may be produced both in the gas phase and in the plasma-sample interface737475. The energy of the S–H bond is only 3.6 eV and is a good target to be attacked by reactive ·OH. H 2 O 2 is another major ROS generated by the cold plasma (mostly as a result of recombination of OH radicals) which has a great role in cell redox signaling pathways. Singlet oxygen is also a reactive oxygen species that play an important role to oxidize cysteine. In Ar plasma the reaction between ROS such as ·OH radicals and amino acid may result in the formation of hydrogen radicals. In a more acidic solution (Ar + H 2 O 2 + DMSO in our study) NO 2 – can be easily protonated and degraded to NO 2  NO and H 2 O. RNS is very important from two points of view:1- generation of amino acids and nitrogen compounds; and 2- as a signaling molecule for controlling metabolism. A combination of NO 2 – with H 2 O 2 and O 3 produces nitrate (NO 3 –)76.

During the deprotonation process of hydroperoxyl radical (OOH) another important radical called superoxide (O 2 –) is generated in PAW. NO radical can help produce other RONS by attacking the amino acid during the oxidation process. ONOOH and ONOO can be produced through reactions:

$${\text{NO}}_{{2}}^{ - } + {\text{ H}}_{{2}} {\text{O}}_{{2}} + {\text{ H}}^{ + } \to {\text{ ONOOH }} + {\text{ H}}_{{2}} {\text{O}}$$ (10)

$${\text{O}}_{{2}}^{ - } + {\text{ NO }} \to {\text{ NO}}_{{3}}^{ - } + {\text{ ONOO}}^{ - }$$ (11)

As a result of these reactions some bonds break while many new bonds form to create numerous bioproducts which have been detected in mass spectra. Breaking the C–S bond and creating a C–C and C=C bond (according to FTIR) was predicted and the amino group (NH 2 ) was attacked with NO radical from plasma to add a new group of NH 2 . The predicted pathways of some chemical compounds were shown in our previous study. For example a single Cysteine molecule when attacked by OH radical and then by O 3 Sulfinic acid can be produced. Further exposure treatment time can oxidize this product to the other structure (Tables S2 S3) by further OH attacking with a molecular weight of (C 3 H 11 NO 5 S; m/z = 174 Da). One common product during plasma treatment is attaching two cysteines whit H-abstraction of them. As mentioned earlier because of the long treatment time and according to Zhou et.al24 cystine can convert to other new products under an over-oxidation process. The final product of this pathway under further exposure contains serine molecules in its structure by (C 6 H 13 N 3 O 9 S 2  m/z = 336 Da) from all plasma treatments (see Fig. 8). By attaching three cysteine-(–SH) molecules and new C–N S–S and S=O bonds a compound (C 11 H 21 N 3 O 11 S 4 ; m/z = 500 Da) contains alanine amino acid was observed from Ar plasma treatment. Some products by (m/z = 583 608 656 Da) contain alanine amino acids in their structures. For example (C 9 H 21 N 5 O 16 S 4 ; m/z = 583 Da) shows more cysteine molecules are joined together each with new OH bonds and an amino group. In addition all sulfur atoms were bombarded with plasma-derived radicals (e.g. O 3  OH H 2 O 2  O 2 ). However this is the first step in this direction and a lot of research needs to be done in this regard this process brings us closer to our goal of making a complete chain of the peptide.

The amount of ROS decreases after reacting with the amino acid information of NO 2 – in the media. The formation of ions such as NO 2 – and NO 3 – causes decreasing the value of the pH and consequently the formation of reactive nitrogen compounds. Thus nitrogen-related radicals can alter amino acids. NO groups can attach to the thiol residues of amino acids or even to amino groups6169. Interestingly O(3P) and O 2 (1Δ g ) as gas phase-derived species exhibited a vital role in forming products and are involved in different modifications of biomolecules. By adding DMSO to plasma the reactive sulfur radical releases and participate in many other reactions. Moreover some other reactive sulfur species (RSS)777879 generate in solution (containing cysteine) cause the formation of chemical reactions to produce many new biomolecules.

As a result of DMSO and ·OH radical interaction two essential products (Sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) and dimethyl sulfone (C 2 H 6 SO 2 )) in the gas phase are produced. Other important factors in the DMSO oxidation process are UV radiation and H 2 O 2 8081. Adding H 2 O 2 makes it possible to generate other reactive radicals such as HOO· and ·OH8283. This leads to the acceleration of the degradation processes of DMSO. The predicted pathway of DMSO degradation is shown in Fig. 9 which is important to generate chemical products for the polymerization process from cysteine.

Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) can be generated in cells via an enzymatic or non-enzymatic pathway. H 2 S in the body acts as a gaseous signaling molecule that is known to inhibit Complex IV of the mitochondrial electron transport chain which effectively reduces ATP generation and biochemical activity within cells84. Releasing this molecule by pathway number (1) in Fig. 10 under the oxidation process can produce bioproduct by (m/z = 50 Da). The NH 3 group on the other hand may contribute to other reactions in producing other products for example through the pathway (2) (m/z = 336 Da).

As said earlier the cleavage of a C–S bond also results in some new products. OH radical is predicted to be a cause of weakening the C–N bond768586. The over-oxidation process may lead to the demolishing of the S–S bond in some products:

$${\text{R}}{-}{\text{S}}{-}{\text{S}}{-}{\text{R }} \to^{ \cdot } {\text{R }} + {\text{ R}}{-}{\text{S}}{-}{\text{S}}^{ \cdot }$$ (28)

$$^{ \cdot } {\text{SH }} + {\text{ O}}_{{2}} \to {\text{ H}}^{ + } + {\text{ SO}}_{{2}}^{ \cdot - }$$ (29)

$${\text{SO}}_{{2}}^{ \cdot } + {\text{ O}}_{{2}} \to {\text{ O}}_{{2}}^{ \cdot - } + {\text{ SO}}_{{2}}$$ (30)

$${\text{SO}}_{{2}} + {\text{ H}}_{{2}} {\text{O }} \to {\text{ H}}^{ + } + {\text{ HSO}}_{{3}}^{ - }$$ (31)

$${\text{R}}{-}{\text{S}}{-}{\text{S}}{-}{\text{R }} + {\text{ HSO}}_{{3}}^{ - } \to {\text{ R}}{-}{\text{SH }} + {\text{ R}}{-}{\text{S}}{-}{\text{SO}}_{{3}}^{ - }$$ (32)

$${\text{R}}{-}{\text{SH }} + {\text{ HSO}}_{{3}} \to {\text{ H}}_{{2}} + {\text{ R}}{-}{\text{S}}{-}{\text{SO}}_{{3}}^{ - }$$ (33)

It is noticeable that (V)UV radiation derives from plasma through cleavage of the C–S bond can be responsible for the formation of alanine and further oxidation of the SH radical. In addition to serine and alanine other molecules are produced during TSP treatments. It is understood that the type of reactive species and the time of treatment687 are very influential in the production and type of biochemical products8889.

Sulfonic acid sulfinic acid carboxylic acid acrylic acid glycine proline and some other amino acid biomolecules were observed in some derivatives by different values of m/z from different TSP treatments. It seems that the ability of all three types of plasma in decomposition and degradation processes is almost the same.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vaW52ZXN0b3JwbGFjZS5jb20vbWFya2V0MzYwLzIwMjMvMDIvdGhlLTctYmVzdC1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLXN0b2Nrcy10by1idXktZm9yLTIwMjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The 7 Best Manufacturing Stocks to Buy for 2023,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vaW52ZXN0b3JwbGFjZS5jb20vbWFya2V0MzYwLzIwMjMvMDIvdGhlLTctYmVzdC1tYW51ZmFjdHVyaW5nLXN0b2Nrcy10by1idXktZm9yLTIwMjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025626702FB0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Courtesy of Hillary Flur

Hillary Flur 31 is the owner of an off-the-grid Airbnb in Joshua Tree California.

Flur started as an Airbnb host 10 years ago when she listed her apartment to afford rent.

Now Flur has an investor new properties on the way and quit her job to do Airbnb full-time.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Hillary Flur 31 an Airbnb owner in Joshua Tree California. It has been edited for length and clarity.

I didn't see myself becoming an Airbnb owner. But after figuring out how to make extra money using the platform my business partner and I decided to buy a space of our own to rent out.

I got my start on Airbnb by listing my apartment to afford rent

When I first moved to California in 2013 I was working at The Honest Company as a customer service agent and couldn't afford to live in LA. Then I heard about Airbnb and I thought to myself: ""I'm going to Airbnb my apartment so I can afford rent.""

My friend Malek Alqadi lived above me and decided to do the same with his apartment. Whenever we had Airbnb guests I would go stay with him or he would come stay with me and we'd just switch back and forth and split the earnings.

My friend and I wondered how much better would it be if we actually owned a property

We'd seen the convenience of Airbnb how much potential it had and how much money we could make. So instead of renting out an apartment to make ends meet we decided to do a project together.

Once we made our decision we spent about a year looking for the right type of property. At first we thought it had to be near LA because we didn't know how we could be hosts if we weren't close by. But we couldn't afford anything.

One of my colleagues at the time told me they were buying an affordable property in Joshua Tree

That's when we started looking out there. It took some time to find the perfect piece of property but we finally landed on two and a half acres out there.

It was a rundown homestead — a remnant from a homestead act where they were basically giving land away for free as long as you built four walls and a roof. Because of that there are all these abandoned shacks in the area.

We purchased a property together for $15000 in 2016

From there we wanted to create a really unique experience. Malek is an architect and designed the space including the second structure. With my background in customer experience I took on creating the customer journey.

My goal was to create a really great experience for customers from when they booked the Airbnb to stepping onto the property for the first time. I made sure to keep in mind things like: what type of amenities we offer what kind of activities there are to do and even what kind of scent we want for the cabin. I really wanted to make it a super cool unique and personalized experience.

We designed our Airbnb to be completely off the grid

I've always been passionate about sustainability so that was important. We also thought about what people wanted to experience when they visited. We found that most people come to Joshua Tree to go camping and have an outdoor experience. That's why we built a stargazing deck on our second building.

To make it happen we took out a Home Depot loan for $40000 and a personal loan. We had the help of a contractor but we were doing a lot of the grunt work. During the summer we were digging out trenches in 110 degree weather while working full time jobs.







Malek and I would work from Monday to Friday in our office and then on the weekends we would drive out to Joshua Tree and start building. The building process took us about a year. I thought it would be a fun passion project but it was way harder than we expected.

It probably took us a year to feel comfortable running the business

The first year was kind of a test year and our success snowballed when we were featured in various publications. We also used that first year to survey customers about their stay and how we could make the property better.

Since we started renting the property in late 2016 unique Airbnbs in Joshua Tree have grown in popularity. There's definitely a debate between locals who love Airbnb and hate it but I think overall it's helped increase job opportunities and the development of new businesses in the area.

It's also increased property values. For people who're trying to do Airbnb in Joshua Tree now it can be pretty hard to find something affordable. Currently our rates are between $725 and $1250 per night to be profitable.

With the success of our first cabin I was able to quit my job recently

We brought on an investor to help with a new property we're working on. We recently purchased 100 acres and we're moving more east to Wonder Valley where we'll build eight new cabins.

Despite our success it's not easy running an Airbnb. It takes a lot of initial work to get a business off the ground get it up and running and create the brand behind it. There's more competition now too so you have to go above and beyond the customer's expectations to make something successful.

Even with great customers you're still dealing with many different types of people. I think without customer service experience it would be difficult to navigate what are real issues and what aren't.

(KRDO) -- One person is dead and four people are in the hospital Sunday after a shooting in the Meridian Ranch neighborhood in unincorporated El Paso County. The El Paso County Sheriff's Office (EPSO) briefly placed the neighborhood under a shelter in place Sunday morning as deputies investigated the shooting.

EPSO says they received multiple 911 calls of shots fired at the 12200 block of Point Reyes Drive around 12:50 a.m. Sunday morning.

When they arrived they found multiple people shot. They transported five people to local hospitals where one died from their injuries.

Neighbors tell KRDO the house at the center of the investigation is frequently rented out as an Airbnb.

Sunday afternoon KRDO captured a screenshot of the home listed on Airbnb. By early Sunday evening the listing was no longer posted on the short-term rental website.

It is unknown whether the home was rented out Saturday night into Sunday morning. KRDO reached out to both the lister and Airbnb Sunday but have not heard back.

However the Meridian Ranch HOA appears to not allow homes to be listed on Airbnb-type sites.

The Meridian Ranch HOA handbook outlines the rules for property uses. Under Section 3.2 the book states ""All Lots shall be used for private residential purposes. No dwelling unit erected or maintained within Property shall be used or occupied for any purpose other than for a single-family residence.""

KRDO called the HOA Sunday but nobody answered the phone.

Meanwhile investigators collected evidence outside the home Sunday where a bullet hole now marks the side of the property.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1enpmZWVkbmV3cy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9za2JhZXIvc2FuLWpvc2UtbWFuLXNob290aW5nLWJsYWNrLW1hbi1oZWFyaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Man Who Allegedly Shot An Unarmed Black Airbnb Guest Who Was Crossing The Street Said “Oh You Think You ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1enpmZWVkbmV3cy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS9za2JhZXIvc2FuLWpvc2UtbWFuLXNob290aW5nLWJsYWNrLW1hbi1oZWFyaW5n0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025625B91930>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The Hawaiian Dictorary also said it means: seeker after knowledge philosopher scientist and scholar.

Some people may remember the dolphin named Akeakamai. In the 1980s Akeakamai was the best-known of the “language” dolphins in Louis Herman’s animal language studies at the Kewalo Basin Marine Mammal Laboratory in Honolulu.

Akeakamai was an Atlantic bottlenose dolphin caught in the Gulf of Mexico and kept at Kewalo Basin Marine Mammal Lab for dolphin cognition and language studies. Photo circa 1985

Akeakamai also was the subject of other scientific studies about dolphin cognition sensory abilities and language acquisition. Akeakamai appeared in National Geographic’s Dolphins with Robin Williams BBC’s Wildlife on One’s Dolphins: Deep Thinkers with David Attenborough and ABC’s Touched by a Dolphin with Sharon Lawrence.

Due to the prominence of Akeakamai in the animal language research the name also was given to a dolphin character in the science fiction novel “Startide Rising” by David Brin.

In the animal world there is another famous Akeakami a Laysan albatross. In 2020 her love life with Wisdom then 69 and the oldest banded albatross was documented by the Friends of Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge.

A Facebook post said the pair were “spotted together on December 9 but have not been seen again. The Good News: It is normal for couples to skip a nesting year and it gives them a much needed rest. Each week our fervent FWS volunteers keep checking their nesting area for any sightings. We will let you know if anything changes!”

Akeakamai also is a girl’s name that rocks according to myfirstname.rocks. But while it may rock Akeakamai is not ranked in the top 1000 of baby girl names according to Babynamespedia.com.

“Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone” is translated into Hawaiian.

And the Hawaiian translation of “Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone” is available for $19.95 on Amazon. It’s called: “Harry Potter a me ka Pōhaku Akeakamai.”

Grow Corn for Ethanol or Use it as Solar Farm?,"Opponents of large solar installations frequently argue that solar farms will take away land that is valuable for food production when farmers decide to stop tilling and instead lease their land to a power company.

A new study released by Clean Wisconsin rebuts those arguments specifically looking at the tradeoffs involved in converting land where corn is grown for ethanol production to electricity production.

Its key finding is that a solar farm can produce 100 times the energy of a comparably sized field planted with corn for ethanol after all energy inputs are included. Those inputs include the cost of building and installing solar panels and growing harvesting transportation and processing costs for ethanol.

But it’s not that simple. For example it’s not that solar farms are always replacing fields where corn is being grown for ethanol sometimes the fields are fallow. Rather the study focused on ethanol production because it represents 1 million acres in Wisconsin that already are producing power rather than food said Paul Mathewson science program director for Clean Wisconsin.

“We already use farm land in Wisconsin to produce energy which is growing corn for ethanol. So we just wanted to push back on that messaging that solar panels and solar facilities are always taking food out of production and show that a quarter of the corn that we’re growing in Wisconsin is already going to energy.”

The important takeaway he said is that solar farms can produce far more energy on significantly less land and at a lower cost than is produced by growing corn for fuel.

A previous Clean Wisconsin report on the clean energy infrastructure that would be needed to reach the state’s goal of net-zero carbon emission by 2050 estimated that 31 gigawatts of solar production will be needed to meet that goal. About 250000 acres would be needed to produce that much energy about one-third of the land currently used to grow corn for ethanol according to the new report.

John Butterbrodt a third-generation farmer near Beaver Dam made the decision to lease 196 acres to Alliant Energy for its Beaver Dam Solar Project. Butterbrodt said he’s a shareholder in an ethanol plant in Friesland and continues to support ethanol and growing corn to produce it. But he said he his brother and a neighbor each decided the economics were better to lease land to Alliant for the 350-acre solar farm that is expected to become operational later this year.

Butterbrodt said he “went public locally” to explain his decision and try to offset other residents’ concerns about the loss of agricultural land.

“There’s people who say ‘Oh we need that for food production’ and I point out that right here in Dodge County the federal government is paying landowners not to crop their lands” he said.

One way of measuring the amount of energy that can be produced on an acre of land is to look at the number of miles that internal-combustion and electric vehicles can be driven based on the energy produced on the same number of acres.

The study estimates that Wisconsin’s 1 million acres of corn produces enough energy to power the annual travel of 700000 internal-combustion passenger cars or 2 million electric vehicles. Solar panels on that acreage could power the annual travel of 60 million electric vehicles the study states. That’s not even close.

If the ethanol is converted to electricity to power electric vehicles corn ethanol would require 32 times the amount of land to power the same number of vehicle miles the study states.

What’s important Mathewson said is that the study highlights how little land — about 3% of the state’s agricultural land — would be needed to meet the state’s future solar energy needs.

“A quarter of the corn that we’re growing in Wisconsin is already going to energy and when you compare the energy efficiencies of the two we could be producing much more energy on the same amount of land” he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy53a293LmNvbS9uZXdzL2dhcmFnZS1jb25zaWRlcmVkLXRvdGFsLWxvc3MtYWZ0ZXItZmlyZS1uZWFyLXBvcnRhZ2UvYXJ0aWNsZV9jYjgzZGMyNi1hNTZlLTExZWQtOGIyMy0wM2QwOTkwZTQ5ZDYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Garage considered 'total loss' after fire near Portage,"Close Get email notifications on {{subject}} daily!

But an out-of-the-blue partnership with Qualcomm and Google on an upcoming mixed-reality platform certainly caught fans off guard. The new ""XR"" technology is an umbrella term for the intersection of AR VR and mixed reality or MR.

In a year that'll see a new PlayStation VR headset a new HTC Vive VR headset a new Meta VR headset and likely a first-ever Apple VR headset how will this Samsung product (or products) end up changing the game and when could it arrive?

Watch this: Samsung Galaxy S23 Event: Everything Revealed 11:20

Samsung's on-stage announcement was incredibly vague with Google's Hiroshi Lockheimer head of Android and Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon promising new hardware and software that'll bring new experiences. But Samsung's and Google's histories in VR (and AR) along with Qualcomm's major presence in the field can point to some answers. So too can the last major Google and Samsung partnership two years ago on smartwatches.

In 2021 Google's partnership with Samsung began a rethinking of its smartwatch lineup which also led to a Pixel Watch last fall. It's likely that this new Samsung-Google-Qualcomm partnership could play out in a similar way in AR and VR. In this instance though both Google and Samsung will be making long-overdue returns to the VR/AR spaces they've both stepped away from for several years.

Here's why Samsung and Google entering the field makes sense and is even sorely needed.

VR and AR needs to work with phones again

VR goggles used to work with phones half a decade ago. Back in the days of the Samsung Gear VR and Google's Daydream View you'd drop a phone into a cheap set of goggles that would use the device as a VR screen. It was a fun novelty back then and greatly expanded access but also had its limits. In 2023 oddly VR headsets barely work with phones at all.

It's annoying because most of us live our lives on our phones. VR meanwhile tends to stand alone. The Meta Quest 2 has slowly developed hooks into phones via its pairing app but doesn't have nearly enough cross-device intelligence.

Qualcomm has been trying to solve this idea already on its own. Via an early wave of AR glasses and certain Android phones the company has been developing tools to bridge apps and experiences and also have glasses directly connected to phones.

That's a lot easier to do with official Android support. Google would enable that and this Samsung-Qualcomm-Google partnership seems like a key to exploring how that would work with new VR headsets or AR glasses or both.

Right now VR is the future. Then AR

No one's perfected AR glasses yet although the hardware pieces are slowly coming together. In the meantime standalone VR headsets using built-in cameras to show ""passthrough"" video of the real world with virtual reality experiences overlaid is the fastest solution to AR. It's also called ""mixed reality"" and it's what the Meta Quest Pro does in some apps. Apple's upcoming mixed reality headset should work the same way. HTC's Vive XR Elite coming this February? Same thing.

I'd expect Samsung and Google to start with developing a similar lightweight VR headset with mixed reality features first using similar Qualcomm chips as other hardware (or a next-gen chipset). After that AR glasses.

Qualcomm has already promised a new generation of low-power wireless AR glasses that will work with next-gen phones over the next three years using a new AR2 Gen 1 chipset announced last fall. Samsung's Google partnership might also involve exploring how to build phones and glasses that could work together in the years to come.

Google's already dipping its toes into assistive AR glasses research and has a decade of experience in AR and VR before that. Samsung has all of its experience with the Gear VR and working with Oculus. Between the two along with Qualcomm it seems like there's plenty of team wisdom.

The Google Pixel Watch and Samsung Galaxy Watch 4. What will Samsung and Google's VR/AR products end up looking like? Lexy Savvides/CNET

A new OS (think smartwatches)

Evolving Android into a new software experience for VR and AR is the biggest challenge and opportunity and it would make a ton of sense for Samsung to lean on Google here. VR headsets of the last five years have tried to go it alone with dedicated app stores much like the Meta Quest. But the whole spirit of the idea of ""the metaverse"" is cross-device compatibility. And in theory easy app support.

Samsung shifted strategy on its watches by adopting Google's WearOS as part of a partnership announced two years ago aiming to bring Samsung's watches closer to Google's Android OS. But Samsung also helped Google think about higher-end health and hardware features to advance its aging smartwatch lineup. Which brings us to…

A road to Pixel hardware?

At some point you'd imagine Google will try to make its own AR/VR hardware again. The team behind Google's Daydream led by Clay Bavor has shifted focus into Google Labs working on more experimental projects like Project Starline (and those research-based assistive AR glasses).

It seems highly likely that the road to Google's future XR hardware will run through Samsung in much the same way as smartwatches ahead of the Pixel Watch. The Galaxy Watch 4 became the first experiment in Wear OS 3 and then Google entered the waters over a year later with a Fitbit-infused Pixel Watch.

AR and VR headsets are significantly more complicated. Maybe Google waits a bit longer on a Pixel device. Maybe as both Google's Lockheimer and Qualcomm's Amon seemed to suggest there will be a variety of forms and possibilities including some that aren't headsets at all. Remember: Google's idea of ""ambient computing"" involves immersive tech from every angle including stuff that isn't worn.

What year will this emerge?

That's the hard question here. It seems likely that Google will dive into this partnership more at its I/O developer conference that usually happens in May which would be right before Apple would likely go over its VR headset at WWDC. We haven't seen any hint of any actual hardware yet. It's not impossible that a standalone VR headset in the spirit of the Meta Quest could materialize sometime sooner than later but it would be a huge surprise if anything arrived in 2023.

When Samsung and Google announced the Wear OS 3 partnership in 2021 it came with a teaser photo of the watch itself and a promise of hardware by year's end. No such statements were made or shown this time and 2024 would seem like the earliest likely launch date.

And at any rate 2023 is looking like a turbulent year for the greater XR world. While plenty of VR hardware is coming it's unclear who can actually afford it. For Samsung and Google the best bet might be to wait out this crowded year and figure out how to make improved possibly more affordable hardware in 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RlY2gtbmV3cy10ZWNobm9sb2d5L2dvb2dsZS1pbnZlc3RzLWluLWNoYXRncHRzLXJpdmFsLWFudGhyb3BpYy04NDI0MTIzL9IBemh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RlY2gtbmV3cy10ZWNobm9sb2d5L2dvb2dsZS1pbnZlc3RzLWluLWNoYXRncHRzLXJpdmFsLWFudGhyb3BpYy04NDI0MTIzL2xpdGUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google invests $400 mn in AI start-up Anthropic: Can it be a gamechanger for the search giant?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='indianexpress.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /article/technology/tech-news-technology/google-invests-in-chatgpts-rival-anthropic-8424123/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025625B91E40>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RlY2gtbmV3cy10ZWNobm9sb2d5L2dvb2dsZS1pbnZlc3RzLWluLWNoYXRncHRzLXJpdmFsLWFudGhyb3BpYy04NDI0MTIzL9IBemh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RlY2gtbmV3cy10ZWNobm9sb2d5L2dvb2dsZS1pbnZlc3RzLWluLWNoYXRncHRzLXJpdmFsLWFudGhyb3BpYy04NDI0MTIzL2xpdGUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZG9sbGFyc2FuZHNlbnNlLnNnL2FscGhhYmV0LWdvb2dsZS0yMDIyLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1yZXN1bHRzLXJldmVudWUtZ3Jvd3MtMTAtaW52ZXN0bWVudHMtYWktY29udGludWluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alphabet (Google) 2022 Financial Results: Revenue Grows 10% With Investments In AI Continuing,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://dollarsandsense.sg/alphabet-google-2022-financial-results-revenue-grows-10-investments-ai-continuing/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZG9sbGFyc2FuZHNlbnNlLnNnL2FscGhhYmV0LWdvb2dsZS0yMDIyLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1yZXN1bHRzLXJldmVudWUtZ3Jvd3MtMTAtaW52ZXN0bWVudHMtYWktY29udGludWluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Loading...

Founded by Sergey Brin and Larry Page in 1998 Google went from a search engine to a technology conglomerate over the years. The company now known as Alphabet Inc GOOGGOOGL is one of the largest companies in the world.

Here’s a look at how the stock has performed since its IPO.

What Happened: In 2003 Google was named the fastest growing technology company. Revenue at the company had grown over 437000% in five years to nearly $1 billion. The company held its IPO in 2004 to offer investors a way to bet on the future success of the company.

Google held its IPO on August 19 2004. The company priced shares at $85 each down from an original range of $108 to $135 and at the low end of a revised range of $85 to $95. The IPO gave Google a valuation of $23 billion.

Shares of the company were up 18% on the first day of trading and over the years would be one of the best performing stocks.

The company has remained a giant in the search engine market and also transformed into mobile phones video gaming and other sectors through acquisitions and new product launches.

In 2015 Google changed its name to Alphabet undergoing a rebranding to help focus on being more than just a search business.

Page called Alphabet a “collection of companies” at the time.

“We liked the name Alphabet because it means a collection of letters that represent language one of humanity’s most important innovations and is the core of how we index with Google search!” Page said.

In 2020 Google became the fourth publicly traded U.S. company to hit a market capitalization of $1 trillion. The company is now valued at $1.4 trillion.

Here’s a look at how shares have performed since the IPO and how much those original shares would be worth now.

Investing $1000 in Google Stock: Google shares priced at $85 on August 19 2004. The shares were offered via auction which may have hurt the initial demand and value. Those lucky enough to get an allocation of shares have been pleasantly rewarded.

A $1000 investment could have purchased 11.76 shares of Google stock in the IPO. Google underwent stocks splits of 2-for-1 in 2014 and 20-for-1 in 2022.

Loading... Loading...

The 11.76 shares would now be a total of 470.4 shares after the stock splits.

The $1000 investment would be worth $1164133.88 today based on a current share price of $105.22 at the time of writing.

Google shares have posted an incredible 116313% return since going public rewarding investors along the way and potentially turning them into millionaires as shown above.

In comparison the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY which follows the S&P 500 Index is up 375.5% over the same time period.

Not every stock is going to be a huge winner or post astronomical returns like those of Google/Alphabet since going public.

The company was a market leader and had posted huge revenue growth at the time of its public offering two factors that may have been signs to investors of a stock with strong potential.

With Google as an example it’s also important to follow the progress a company is making in diversification and through acquisition to expand to new areas once growth has declined or competitors have emerged in its key business area.

But an out-of-the-blue partnership with Qualcomm and Google on an upcoming mixed-reality platform certainly caught fans off guard. The new ""XR"" technology is an umbrella term for the intersection of AR VR and mixed reality or MR.

In a year that'll see a new PlayStation VR headset a new HTC Vive VR headset a new Meta VR headset and likely a first-ever Apple VR headset how will this Samsung product (or products) end up changing the game and when could it arrive?

Watch this: Samsung Galaxy S23 Event: Everything Revealed 11:20

Samsung's on-stage announcement was incredibly vague with Google's Hiroshi Lockheimer head of Android and Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon promising new hardware and software that'll bring new experiences. But Samsung's and Google's histories in VR (and AR) along with Qualcomm's major presence in the field can point to some answers. So too can the last major Google and Samsung partnership two years ago on smartwatches.

In 2021 Google's partnership with Samsung began a rethinking of its smartwatch lineup which also led to a Pixel Watch last fall. It's likely that this new Samsung-Google-Qualcomm partnership could play out in a similar way in AR and VR. In this instance though both Google and Samsung will be making long-overdue returns to the VR/AR spaces they've both stepped away from for several years.

Here's why Samsung and Google entering the field makes sense and is even sorely needed.

VR and AR needs to work with phones again

VR goggles used to work with phones half a decade ago. Back in the days of the Samsung Gear VR and Google's Daydream View you'd drop a phone into a cheap set of goggles that would use the device as a VR screen. It was a fun novelty back then and greatly expanded access but also had its limits. In 2023 oddly VR headsets barely work with phones at all.

It's annoying because most of us live our lives on our phones. VR meanwhile tends to stand alone. The Meta Quest 2 has slowly developed hooks into phones via its pairing app but doesn't have nearly enough cross-device intelligence.

Qualcomm has been trying to solve this idea already on its own. Via an early wave of AR glasses and certain Android phones the company has been developing tools to bridge apps and experiences and also have glasses directly connected to phones.

That's a lot easier to do with official Android support. Google would enable that and this Samsung-Qualcomm-Google partnership seems like a key to exploring how that would work with new VR headsets or AR glasses or both.

Right now VR is the future. Then AR

No one's perfected AR glasses yet although the hardware pieces are slowly coming together. In the meantime standalone VR headsets using built-in cameras to show ""passthrough"" video of the real world with virtual reality experiences overlaid is the fastest solution to AR. It's also called ""mixed reality"" and it's what the Meta Quest Pro does in some apps. Apple's upcoming mixed reality headset should work the same way. HTC's Vive XR Elite coming this February? Same thing.

I'd expect Samsung and Google to start with developing a similar lightweight VR headset with mixed reality features first using similar Qualcomm chips as other hardware (or a next-gen chipset). After that AR glasses.

Qualcomm has already promised a new generation of low-power wireless AR glasses that will work with next-gen phones over the next three years using a new AR2 Gen 1 chipset announced last fall. Samsung's Google partnership might also involve exploring how to build phones and glasses that could work together in the years to come.

Google's already dipping its toes into assistive AR glasses research and has a decade of experience in AR and VR before that. Samsung has all of its experience with the Gear VR and working with Oculus. Between the two along with Qualcomm it seems like there's plenty of team wisdom.

The Google Pixel Watch and Samsung Galaxy Watch 4. What will Samsung and Google's VR/AR products end up looking like? Lexy Savvides/CNET

A new OS (think smartwatches)

Evolving Android into a new software experience for VR and AR is the biggest challenge and opportunity and it would make a ton of sense for Samsung to lean on Google here. VR headsets of the last five years have tried to go it alone with dedicated app stores much like the Meta Quest. But the whole spirit of the idea of ""the metaverse"" is cross-device compatibility. And in theory easy app support.

Samsung shifted strategy on its watches by adopting Google's WearOS as part of a partnership announced two years ago aiming to bring Samsung's watches closer to Google's Android OS. But Samsung also helped Google think about higher-end health and hardware features to advance its aging smartwatch lineup. Which brings us to…

A road to Pixel hardware?

At some point you'd imagine Google will try to make its own AR/VR hardware again. The team behind Google's Daydream led by Clay Bavor has shifted focus into Google Labs working on more experimental projects like Project Starline (and those research-based assistive AR glasses).

It seems highly likely that the road to Google's future XR hardware will run through Samsung in much the same way as smartwatches ahead of the Pixel Watch. The Galaxy Watch 4 became the first experiment in Wear OS 3 and then Google entered the waters over a year later with a Fitbit-infused Pixel Watch.

AR and VR headsets are significantly more complicated. Maybe Google waits a bit longer on a Pixel device. Maybe as both Google's Lockheimer and Qualcomm's Amon seemed to suggest there will be a variety of forms and possibilities including some that aren't headsets at all. Remember: Google's idea of ""ambient computing"" involves immersive tech from every angle including stuff that isn't worn.

What year will this emerge?

That's the hard question here. It seems likely that Google will dive into this partnership more at its I/O developer conference that usually happens in May which would be right before Apple would likely go over its VR headset at WWDC. We haven't seen any hint of any actual hardware yet. It's not impossible that a standalone VR headset in the spirit of the Meta Quest could materialize sometime sooner than later but it would be a huge surprise if anything arrived in 2023.

When Samsung and Google announced the Wear OS 3 partnership in 2021 it came with a teaser photo of the watch itself and a promise of hardware by year's end. No such statements were made or shown this time and 2024 would seem like the earliest likely launch date.

And at any rate 2023 is looking like a turbulent year for the greater XR world. While plenty of VR hardware is coming it's unclear who can actually afford it. For Samsung and Google the best bet might be to wait out this crowded year and figure out how to make improved possibly more affordable hardware in 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RlY2gtbmV3cy10ZWNobm9sb2d5L2dvb2dsZS1pbnZlc3RzLWluLWNoYXRncHRzLXJpdmFsLWFudGhyb3BpYy04NDI0MTIzL9IBemh0dHBzOi8vaW5kaWFuZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS90ZWNobm9sb2d5L3RlY2gtbmV3cy10ZWNobm9sb2d5L2dvb2dsZS1pbnZlc3RzLWluLWNoYXRncHRzLXJpdmFsLWFudGhyb3BpYy04NDI0MTIzL2xpdGUv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Google invests $400 mn in AI start-up Anthropic: Can it be a gamechanger for the search giant?,"In the run up to introducing its own AI services search behemoth Google is leaving no stones unturned. On Friday it was reported that the Alphabet Inc. company has invested over $400 million in artificial intelligence startup Anthropic putting it in the spotlight. Anthropic has been testing a potential rival to OpenAI’s revolutionary chat bot ChatGPT. And this move comes at a time when Google which has been feeling the heat has been making stealthy moves to ace its AI game.

Anthropic was founded by Dario Amodei former VP of research at OpenAI and his sister Daniela in 2021 in San Francisco with the aim to create large-scale AI systems that are interpretable and robust. According to a report published in TechCrunch Dario moved out of OpenAI owing to his belief that there was a need for the AI industry to move beyond a handful of innovations such as GPT-3. The Amodei siblings have been working on the core idea that most of the AI models out there are not fully understood.

In January it came to the attention of the AI community that the start-up founded by OpenAI’s former employees developed a similar AI system to ChatGPT known as Claude. Since it was available as a part of closed beta not much has been known about it. Regardless several testers in the beta have detailed their interactions with Claude on social media.

Claude explained

Anthropic created Claude using a method known as ‘constitutional AI’. The company in a thread shared on Twitter on December 16 last year said that Claude aims to offer a ‘principle-based’ approach that aligns AI systems with human intentions. This essentially means that it uses AI similar to ChatGPT to respond to questions based on a simple set of principles.

We’ve trained language models to be better at responding to adversarial questions without becoming obtuse and saying very little. We do this by conditioning them with a simple set of behavioral principles via a technique called Constitutional AI: https://t.co/rlft1pZlP5 pic.twitter.com/MIGlKSVTe9 — Anthropic (@AnthropicAI) December 16 2022

In order to build Claude Anthropic began by assembling a list of 10 principles that combine to form a ‘constitution’. While these principles are not in the public domain yet Anthropic has revealed that they are backed by the concepts of beneficence which is maximising positive impact; nonmaleficence – not giving harmful advice and autonomy which stands for respecting the freedom of choice. In essence Claude is similar to ChatGPT and other language models as it is a statistical tool that predicts words.

According to Anthropic Claude consumed a vast set of text examples from the web and learned how words occur based on the semantic context surrounding text. This has enabled Claude to have open-ended conversations crack jokes and engage in philosophical debate on a wide range of topics.

What does all this mean to Google?

Both Google and Anthropic have not commented on the investment. However they have separately announced a partnership where the AI start-up will be using Google’s cloud computing services. The investment comes at a time when Google’s parent company missed both top and bottom lines in the fourth quarter and the widespread popularity of ChatGPT. The emergence of ChatGPT and numerous other AI-backed technologies in recent times seems to have pushed the search engine giant to devise newer ways to stay on top of the game.

The rise of OpenAI’s chatbot is looming large on the search giant. While a routine search would render links and images to respective queries ChatGPT yields concise human-like sentences in response. The application goes a notch higher with its ability to create content from scratch which is certainly seen as disruptive. All these certainly are signaling a time for major upheaval for Google and its line of products and services.

Reinventing through AI

Perhaps it’s for this reason that Google seems to be scrambling to come out with its own AI innovation. A recent report from The New York Times stated that the tech behemoth has sought the help of Larry Page and Sergey Brin the founders of its parent company Alphabet. The same report also said that the founders had already approved plans including the addition of chatbot features to Google. The company is planning to launch over 20 AI products and will showcase a version of Google with chatbot features.

All this coincides with Microsoft’s massive investment into AI and ChatGPT. Google has been working with the language model LaMDA (Language Model For Dialogue Applications) and with Anthropic in the ring it remains to be seen how potent Google’s AI vision will be and whether it will dominate the AI industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZG9sbGFyc2FuZHNlbnNlLnNnL2FscGhhYmV0LWdvb2dsZS0yMDIyLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1yZXN1bHRzLXJldmVudWUtZ3Jvd3MtMTAtaW52ZXN0bWVudHMtYWktY29udGludWluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Alphabet (Google) 2022 Financial Results: Revenue Grows 10% With Investments In AI Continuing,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://dollarsandsense.sg/alphabet-google-2022-financial-results-revenue-grows-10-investments-ai-continuing/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vZG9sbGFyc2FuZHNlbnNlLnNnL2FscGhhYmV0LWdvb2dsZS0yMDIyLWZpbmFuY2lhbC1yZXN1bHRzLXJldmVudWUtZ3Jvd3MtMTAtaW52ZXN0bWVudHMtYWktY29udGludWluZy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

One of which is the dramatic growth in online SNAP services. According to the USDA over 3 million SNAP households shopped online in May 2022 significantly more than the 35000 in March 2020.

For example participants can use their SNAP money to order through Amazon Fresh without needing a Prime membership. Following a 2019 pilot last year Amazon rolled the scheme out throughout the country. Now residents of all states apart from Alaska can use their EBT cards to pay for Amazon Fresh groceries.

The new Amazon Fresh delivery fee structure

One issue with SNAP online shopping is that SNAP funds can't be used to pay delivery charges whether that's with Amazon Fresh or other stores. This can eat into the money people need for other essentials such as rent and utility bills. As a result online services with free delivery or low qualification thresholds are much more useful for SNAP households.

Up until now that wasn't too much of a problem with the Amazon Fresh service because you only had to spend $35 to get free deliveries. Unfortunately the service will soon charge hefty delivery fees on orders less than $150. Avoiding the $14.99 monthly Amazon Prime fee for SNAP recipients doesn't help much if they have to pay almost $10 for small orders.

From Feb. 28 the new Amazon Fresh delivery fees will be:

Orders under $50: $9.95

Orders of $50 to $100: $6.95

Orders of $100 to $150: $3.95

Orders over $150: Free

It's difficult for many SNAP households to spend $150 in one go especially those with just one or two people. According to the USDA the maximum SNAP benefit for a one-person household is $281 so it would use more than half their monthly food budget to meet the $150 free delivery threshold. The new charges will present additional challenges for SNAP recipients who are elderly or disabled and rely heavily on delivery services.

How SNAP recipients can manage the changes to Amazon Fresh

It's frustrating when a service that has helped you save money introduces new fees. More so since Amazon's new charges come at a time when more Americans are taking on debt or using credit cards to pay for essentials like food.

The good news is that you don't have to use Amazon Fresh. Even if you don't want to go to the store there are a number of other online grocery stores that take SNAP payments. The USDA says more than 150 chains now offer online shopping to SNAP participants. Look for SNAP approved online retailers that operate in your state. You never know you might find better bargains than Amazon Fresh as well as lower delivery costs.

Another option? Consider shopping in person -- it isn't as convenient but you can often find different deals in store than you'll get online. Plus your money will go further if you can find double-up food programs operating in your area. There are a couple of projects that let you get two for the price of one on your fruit and vegetables when you pay with your EBT card at participating farmers markets and stores.

If you want to carry on using Amazon look for products labeled ""SNAP EBT Eligible"" in the Amazon grocery store. In addition to Amazon Fresh SNAP eligible groceries are available with Whole Foods and Amazon Groceries. There's a fee of $9.99 on all Whole Foods deliveries but orders of $25 or more in the Amazon Grocery store still qualify for free delivery. You'll need to add your SNAP EBT card to your Amazon account and enter your EBT pin when you pay.

Bottom line

The new Amazon Fresh delivery charges could make a significant dent in many peoples' bank accounts whether or not they are SNAP recipients. A $9.95 fee on a purchase of $50 or less could equate to 20% or more of the total shop and the $150 threshold for free delivery is out of many people's reach.

Only 2.1 million cars are registered in Missouri.

Rather than invest more in clean energy like wind and solar and pass savings on to customers Ameren has a monopolistic request for a $316 million rate increase adding $12 per month to the average residential electric customer during an uneven economic recovery. I believe the Missouri Public Service Commission should deny this rate increase.

Customers already pay too much for this dirty coal which in 2020 produced 67% of Ameren’s energy. Between 2016-2018 Ameren’s coal plants cost $347 million more to operate compared to market energy prices. It would have been cheaper for Ameren to purchase electricity from the market instead of operating its dirty coal plants.

Ameren executives make business decisions over public health concerns. I think Missourians should oppose this rate increase and demand that the company replace its dirty and expensive coal plants with clean energy.

US-based Meenakshi Sengupta  a cancer patient was supposed to travel from Delhi to New York onboard American Airlines  was offloaded at the Delhi airport after she allegedly did not comply with the crew's instructions to keep her handbag in the overhead cabin.Sengupta claimed that she had asked for assistance to lift the bag because she had a recent surgery and was wearing a cast but she was allegedly refused help and then asked to alight from the aircraft reported TOI. A police complaint as been filed against the airline for “mistreating her and deboarding her off the aircraft wrongfully when asked for assistance for a bag weighing more than 5 pounds”.“On January 30 prior to the departure of American Airlines flight 293 from Delhi (DEL) to New York ( JFK ) a disruptive customer was removed from the aircraft for failure to follow crew member instructions. Our Customer Relations team has reached out to the customer to refund the unused portion of their ticket” American Airlines said in a statement.Arun Kumar DG Directorate General of Civil Aviation told TOI: “We will seek a report and look into this. We do not approve of insensitivity.”Sengupta was in India on a vacation when she was diagnosed with cancer and had to undergo surgery. She then was to return to the US. After the incident she had to book a fresh ticket on another airline as she had a doctor’s appointment to continue medical treatment there.Tagging American Airlines on social media  the complainant’s daughter also narrated the experience her mother had to undergo inside the flight.Sengupta who was a wheelchair passenger stated in her complaint that “the ground staff was very supportive and helpful and helped me get into the aircraft and put my handbag on the side of the seat. Once inside the flight I had a conversation with the air hostess and I explained my health condition to them. None of the flight attendants mentioned about putting her handbag away but when the lights were dimmed and when the aircraft was about to depart a flight attendant asked me to keep the bag in the overhead bin and refused to help saying ‘it’s not my job to do so’.”After repeated requests for assistance the cabin crew allegedly told her that she would be removed from the aircraft and the captain too did not help saying that a decision had been made already. “They were largely indifferent and didn’t want to interfere at all. They just kept asking me that I should be able to lift my own bags and manage everything. It’s not their job to help passengers (even with special needs or health issues). They said that if I’m so uncomfortable I should just deboard the flight. They were collective in their decision to deboard me” Sengupta alleged.Sengupta told TOI: “The flight attendant told me without provocation that I will be thrown out. I had a cast from my shoulder to my hand. It was a disrespectful experience. I could not fly the next day because they had flagged my PNR. I booked a ticket on another airline to Atlanta and from there travelled by road to Charlotte.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmxpbmVzLWFpcnBvcnRzL2RlbHRhLXJldmVhbHMtbmV3LWRpcmVjdC1mbGlnaHRzLWZyb20tbnljLXRvLXNvdXRoLWFtZXJpY2HSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta Reveals New Direct Flights From NYC to South America,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.travelpulse.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/airlines-airports/delta-reveals-new-direct-flights-from-nyc-to-south-america (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002562814FF10>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbHB1bHNlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FpcmxpbmVzLWFpcnBvcnRzL2RlbHRhLXJldmVhbHMtbmV3LWRpcmVjdC1mbGlnaHRzLWZyb20tbnljLXRvLXNvdXRoLWFtZXJpY2HSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNWh0dHBzOi8vbGl2ZWFuZGxldHNmbHkuY29tL3dvbWFuLXBhbnRzLW1pYW1pLWFpcnBvcnQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"""Why Would I Need Pants On?""

One woman certainly thought it was just fine to stride through Miami International Airport without pants on.

Woman Walks Through Miami Airport Without Pants On

A woman was captured on film going through security at Miami wearing a neon yellow top that said Costa Rica on it…and no pants. Live and let’s live?

She seemed to be struggling to pull her three carry-on items as she waited in the airport security line. Airlines do not allow three carry-on items (some don’t even allow a single larger item any longer) so she may have had a greater battle at the gate ahead of her than her choice to leave her pants at home.

CONCLUSION

As Gary Leff put it “People don’t dress up to fly the way they used to. And at airports in South Florida sometimes they barely dress up at all.” These days I tend to shrug at stories like this. Even so it is indeed a reminder that not only have we given up dressing up to fly but we’ve given up the idea of even covering up in public places.

Let the family know you are thinking of them

Richard Hunsicker 89 of Niles passed away on Sunday February 5 2023 at the West Woods of Niles following an illness.

He was born in McGuffy Ohio to the late Paul E. and Mary F. (Durbin) Hunsicker.

Richard graduated from a small schoolhouse in Marseilles Ohio and shortly thereafter enlisted in the U.S. Army serving his country proudly until his honorable discharge in 1956. He married Beatrice “Bea” M. Windle at a ceremony in Lima Ohio on December 24 1955.

He retired after forty years with American Electric Power (AEP) as an electrician spending a large portion of those years at the Cook Nuclear Plant. Richard was a man of great faith and enjoyed taking his family to church. He was a devoted husband father and grandfather that enjoyed time with his family including many camping trips. Richard also enjoyed helping his family with their homes assisting with the wiring plumbing and many other projects.

He is preceded in death by his parents; an infant son Keith Michael Hunsicker and a brother Paul E. ""Gene"" Hunsicker Jr.

Richard is survived by his beloved wife Bea Hunsicker of Niles; his children Thomas (Carole) Hunsicker of Cairo Ohio Craig (Deborah) Hunsicker of Bristol Wisconsin Linda (Herbert) Brandt of St. Joseph Michigan and Lisa (Brent) Book of Niles Michigan; eleven grandchildren; three step-grandchildren; sixteen great-grandchildren and a sister Jane (Merwyn) Hastings of Delaware Ohio.

Funeral services will be held on Thursday February 9 2023 at Brown Funeral Home in Niles at 1:00 p.m. with a time of visitation beginning at Noon. An interment will follow with Full Military Honors at Mission Hills Memorial Gardens by the U. S. Army and American Legion Post 51 from Buchanan.

Memorial contributions may be made in Richard’s memory to Caring Circle Hospice at 4025 Health Park Lane St. Joseph Michigan 49085.

Gunshots fired at two power substations in Moore County North Carolina late last year left 45000 homes and businesses without power and more attacks just like that could already be planned by domestic extremist groups according to experts.

“All of a sudden about 8:45 p.m. about 20 shots fired off right across the street” Spencer Matthews told CNN affiliate WRAL shortly after the December attack.

The gunfire hit critical parts of the substations and the power went out.

“Got no way to heat because we don’t have a fireplace” one woman told WRAL after her home was plunged into darkness.

Investigators found nearly two dozen shell casings from a high-powered rifle near the substations but so far have not found a gun or made any arrests.

Experts say the two substation attacks could be the work of domestic extremists who have openly advocated targeting a vulnerable power system.

Attacking the power grid to start a race war

The motive behind the December 3 attack is still not known but it came after an FBI bulletin in November warned of threats by extremist groups to “create civil disorder and inspire further violence.”

“This typically very primitive style attack equals millions of dollars in damage” Brian Harrell a former US Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection told CNN. “If you were to shoot out some very key components you can quickly create an effect where this large multimillion dollar transformer becomes essentially a paperweight.”

In 2022 there were 25 “actual physical attacks” reported on power facilities across the US and one report of “sabotage” according to the latest statistics available from the Department of Energy.

The data also shows 57 reports of suspicious activity and 80 acts of vandalism.

The numbers are mostly trending up compared with 2021 when there were six actual physical attacks reported and two reports of sabotage. The data also shows 32 reports of suspicious activity and 52 acts of vandalism.

Many attacks remain unsolved.

“There’s no doubt in my mind that 2023… is probably going to be the most catastrophic when it comes to the uptick of DVE (Domestic Violent Extremist) attacks on electricity infrastructure” Harrell said. “A number of individuals and extremist groups online right now have already signaled that this is a part of their playbook.”

One of those playbooks with a swastika and lightning bolts on the cover published on a social media platform by a neo-Nazi group makes their aim quite clear.

“The main thing that keeps the anti-White system going is the powergrid” the document reads. “This is something that is easier than you think. Peppered all over the country are power distribution substations… Sitting ducks worthy prey.”

It’s part of a White-power philosophy called “accelerationism” which wants to destroy society and replace it with one based on their racist ideologies.

“With the power off when the lights don’t come back on… all hell will break lose [sic] making conditions desirable for our race to once again take back what is ours” they write.

The head of another accelerationist group posted on social media that these attackers have “cracked the code on lone wolf attacks.”

The attacks “check off all the necessary boxes which I didn’t think possible for lone wolf ops in USA – Frequency sustainability geographic concentration” he is quoted as saying. “Law enforcement appears powerless (no pun intended) to stop them.”

A few coordinated attacks could collapse the system

These groups dream of striking exactly the right spots in the power grid which government reports have warned for decades could cause a domino effect and leave huge parts of the country in the dark.

“If you were to target you know eight or nine very key nodes throughout the United States you potentially could have a collapsing effect” Harrell warns.

High voltage transmission power lines and substations are often spread across the country in out of the way places which can be hard to keep safe and technically challenging to secure.

“It’s inherently very difficult to harden or protect it all” Granger Morgan an engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University told CNN. “It may not take all that high tech an approach to cause physical disruption that could have very large consequences.”

Morgan is the chair of the National Academy of Science’s committee on enhancing the resilience of the nation’s power system.

“Physical attacks on major system components could cause serious physical damage especially to large transformers and other hard to replace substation and transmission equipment such as high voltage circuit breakers” one of his papers from 2017 warned. “Recovery could easily require many days or weeks.”

Right now there is no central authority that regulates the entire power system which Morgan says gets in the way of changes needed to make the system more robust and resilient from attack.

Justice Department forms new domestic terrorism unit

“No one at the moment has authority to deal with the entire system and we need to get that situation fixed” he said. “We’ve got the federal regulators overseeing the high voltage system that brings power across long distances. We’ve got state public utility commissions dealing with things at the state level we got both private and public power.”

Morgan said a presidential commission or other powerful political body needs to be appointed to take the lead in protecting the grid and making it more resilient to attacks.

“We just need to get much more systematic in terms of figuring out both how we protect against it but also how we can quickly put the system back together again once a problem arises” he said."
AXP,American Express,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS90aGUtc3RyYW5nZS1teXRob2xvZ3ktYXJvdW5kLXRoZS1hbWV4LXBsYXRpbnVtLWNhcmQtYW5kLWFtZXJpY2FuLWV4cHJlc3Mtc3VjY2Vzcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Strange Mythology Around The Amex Platinum Card And American Express Success,"American Express appears to be doing well with its Platinum card having turned it into an Entertainment Book of coupons you pay for and then strive to get more value than its cost from. I have the card and do this successfully but the mythology around the product is strange?

Bloomberg runs a paean to Amex that makes claims that just seem wrong: “It boosted points and added new benefits then raised fees in the middle of a pandemic. The risky strategy worked.”

Boosted points? They made a number of changes to the Platinum card but largely around statement credits more than offsetting the increase annual fee. Contra Bloomberg “dangling hundreds of thousands of points before existing customers” simply did not happen in the U.S.

Six years ago I wrote that based on Departures magazine circulation there appeared to be ~ 1.3 million Platinum and Centurion cardmembers mostly in New York California Texas and Florida – and that there were likely fewer than 750 in North Dakota. The piece reports that Platinum cardmembership has doubled since then.

But describing the Platinum card thusly? “It’s more like a personal butler fulfilling the affluent class’s every whim.” How many people have successfully gotten something from the Amex concierge service they couldn’t have done themselves more or less as easily?

The company has enough plastic in wallets to pave a path from its New York headquarters to its offices in California and back. And it’s convinced a new generation of cardholders that it’s a lifestyle brand and not really in the boring business of debt instruments whatever its balance sheet says. It’s more like a personal butler fulfilling the affluent class’s every whim.

American Express is benefiting from a strong consumer over the past two years but it doesn’t appear to be benefiting disproportionately.

I fully utilize Amex credits on spend I’d be doing otherwise making the annual fee worthwhile. The $200 airline fee credit with Southwest; $200 Uber credit; $189 CLEAR credit (pre-price increase covering my membership and my wife’s); $240 Entertainment credit; $50 Saks credit twice yearly. Then having more than covered the cost of the card I get Hilton Gold status and access to Delta lounges when flying Delta and to Centurion lounges though I often skip the latter due to crowds. Almost the only spend I do on the card is airfare for 5x earning.

Inflation has also made nominal card spend go up quite a lot. The overall macro environment has made issuers look like geniuses. Reputations are really built though during tough times.

American Express and Delta have had a close relationship for many years and as part of that they issue seven co-branded Delta Amex cards including the Blue Gold Platinum and Reserve cards (with the exception of the Blue product all the others have both a personal and business version).

In this post I wanted to look at the popular Delta SkyMiles Gold American Express Card. This card has a reasonable annual fee and is ideal for someone looking for basic benefits that come in handy when flying Delta. If you’re a Medallion elite flyer on Delta another card might be a better option (more on that below).

Delta Gold Amex Welcome Bonus: 40000 SkyMiles

The Gold Delta SkyMiles Amex has a welcome offer of 40000 bonus miles after spending $2000 on purchases within the first six months. I value SkyMiles at 1.1 cents each so that bonus is worth ~$440. An ok bonus with a reasonable spending requirement.

Redeem SkyMiles for China Airlines’ excellent business class

Card Eligibility

The welcome offer on the card is “once in a lifetime” so it’s not available to you if you currently have the card or if you’ve had the card in the past. However note that you can get each “flavor” of the Delta Amex card so you are eligible for this card if you’ve had the Platinum or Reserve or if you’ve had any of the business versions. You can read more about Amex’s general application restrictions here.

Annual Fee

The Gold Delta SkyMiles American Express Card has a $0 introductory annual fee for the first year then $150. (Rates & Fees). This is a great opportunity to try the card before you have to “buy” it. You can add additional users to the card at no extra cost.

Earning Miles With Gold Delta Amex Card

The Gold Delta SkyMiles Credit Card offers:

2x SkyMiles for purchases directly with Delta including flights Delta Sky Club memberships seat upgrades and more

2x SkyMiles at restaurants globally

2x SkyMiles at U.S. supermarkets

1x SkyMiles on all other eligible purchases

You can earn bonus points on dining purchases with the card

While it’s nice that the card has some bonus categories I don’t find the bonuses to be particularly compelling. There are still better cards out there for airfare purchases restaurant purchases and grocery store purchases.

No Foreign Transaction Fees

If you are going to put spending on the card the good news is that there are no foreign transaction fees (Rates & Fees) with the Gold Delta Amex so you can use the card abroad without paying those high fees.

Gold Delta Amex Card Benefits & Perks

The Gold Delta SkyMiles Credit Card has an excellent welcome bonus though this isn’t a card I would use for everyday spending as there are much better cards out there. The real reason you’ll want to keep this card long-term is because of the perks and benefits that it offers which are great for the casual Delta flyer. Let’s take a closer look at those.

First Checked Bag Free

Just for having the Gold Delta SkyMiles Card you get a first checked bag free which would otherwise cost $30 one-way per person:

This benefit is limited to the primary cardmember and anyone traveling on the same reservation with them (up to nine people)

You don’t have to pay for your flight with your Delta Amex though you do need to have your SkyMiles number in the reservation

This is only valid for travel on Delta and Delta Connection

This is a great value given that you’ll usually pay $60 per person roundtrip for a checked bag. If you’re traveling with someone then you’re looking at $120 roundtrip in savings which more than covers the annual fee on the card.

Save on checked bag fees with the Delta Gold Amex

Delta Priority Boarding

For having the Delta Gold Amex you receive Main Cabin 1 Priority Boarding on Delta flights which helps you to board early and make sure you can find space for your carry-ons.

This is also valid for a total of up to nine people traveling on the same reservation with the primary cardmember.

Get priority boarding with the Delta Gold Amex

20% Delta Inflight Savings

If you have the Gold Delta Amex then you can save 20% in the form of a statement credit for eligible pre-purchased meals and in-flight purchases of food / alcoholic beverages on Delta flights. Allow 8-12 weeks for the statement credit to post.

Save on inflight purchases with the card

Pay With Miles

Delta has a Pay With Miles feature where if you have a Delta co-branded credit card you can redeem miles for one cent each toward a Delta flight purchase (in increments of 5000 miles per $50). That’s not the best deal in the world though this is a feature that’s exclusively available to those with an eligible card.

Some people find this to be useful since they can redeem their miles toward flights and then they still earn elite miles for taking those flights.

Pay With Points is a feature that many SkyMiles members value

15% Savings On SkyMiles Award Flights

With the TakeOff 15 perk (exclusively for those with select Delta Amex cards) you can save 15% on the cost of a SkyMiles award ticket when traveling exclusively on Delta. Delta SkyMiles award pricing is dynamic and generally you’ll find that each mile gets you a bit over a cent toward the cost of a ticket.

Saving 15% on these awards is valuable and means that you’ll generally get somewhere around 1.2-1.3 cents of value per mile (or sometimes even more). In many cases this will end up being a better value than using the Pay With Miles option so it’s a real perk of the card.

Amex Offers

One of the great features of Amex cards is access to Amex Offers which offers savings or bonus points on purchases with all kinds of retailers. There’s huge value to be had in getting as many Amex cards as possible so that you can get these offers on multiple cards.

Amex Offers could save you hundreds of dollars per year. You can access these offers by logging into your account and scrolling down to the bottom of your account summary page.

ShopRunner Membership

For having the Delta Gold Amex you get a ShopRunner membership which gets you free two-day shipping on eligible items at a network of 100+ online stores. You just have to enroll in your complimentary membership and can then start taking advantage of it.

Is The Gold Delta SkyMiles American Express Worth It?

The Gold Delta SkyMiles Credit Card isn’t a card I’d be using for my everyday spending since there are many more rewarding cards for that. However:

This card has a nice welcome bonus

This card can be worth holding onto for the first checked bag free priority boarding inflight savings access to Pay With Miles access to 15% savings on award flights Amex Offers and more

In other words for someone who flies Delta occasionally I think this is the best card to get and the benefits can more than offset the annual fee.

Looking For A Business Credit Card?

If this card sounds interesting to you but you want a business card instead consider the Delta SkyMiles® Gold Business American Express Card. The only significant difference is that the business card earns 2x SkyMiles on U.S. shipping and on U.S. advertising rather than 2x SkyMiles at U.S. supermarkets. Learn more about applying for Amex business cards.

What About Delta’s No Annual Fee Card?

The Delta SkyMiles® Blue American Express Card (review) has no annual fee (Rates & Fees) and offers the following benefits:

The card earns 2x SkyMiles on Delta purchases and at restaurants worldwide

The card offers 20% back on inflight purchases

The card has no foreign transaction fees (Rates & Fees)

The card gives you access to Delta’s Pay With Miles feature but doesn’t give you access to the 15% award discount

Beyond that though there are limited perks. If you’d get value out of a first checked bag free or priority boarding then you’re much better off getting one of Delta’s cards with an annual fee.

Consider Earning Amex Membership Rewards Points

If you are looking to earn Delta SkyMiles through credit card spending then consider using a card earning Amex Membership Rewards points. That’s because these points can be transferred to Delta SkyMiles at a 1:1 ratio and you can in many cases earn points at a much faster rate.

For example the American Express® Gold Card (review) offers 4x points at restaurants and at U.S. supermarkets (on up to $25000 in purchases per calendar year) and 3x points on flights booked directly with airlines or at amextravel.com. Furthermore earning Amex points gives you more flexibility to redeem in other ways given all the great uses of Membership Rewards points.

Bottom Line

The Gold Delta SkyMiles Credit Card is a card that can be worth holding onto for the benefits that it offers like a free checked bag priority boarding inflight savings and more.

For the more frequent Delta flyer consider the Platinum Delta SkyMiles Credit Card which has a bigger bonus and more perks but also has a higher annual fee.

In this post I wanted to look at the Delta SkyMiles® Platinum American Express Card. This is one of Amex’s premium co-branded Delta credit cards which offers a lot of value for frequent Delta flyers. Given the four personal Delta credit cards is this the right card for you?

Delta Platinum Amex Bonus Of 50000 SkyMiles

The Platinum Delta SkyMiles Card has a welcome offer of 50000 bonus miles after you spend $3000 in purchases on your new Card in your first 6 months. I value SkyMiles at 1.1 cents each so to me the bonus is worth $550.

However note that you can get each “flavor” of the Delta Amex card so you are eligible for this card if you’ve had the Gold or Reserve or if you’ve had any of the business versions of the card.

You can read more about Amex’s general application restrictions here.

Delta Platinum Amex Annual Fee

The Platinum Delta Amex has a $350 annual fee (Rates & Fees). You can add additional users to the card at no extra cost (Rates & Fees).

Earning Miles With Delta Platinum Amex Card

The Delta Platinum Amex offers the following points earning opportunities for spending:

3x SkyMiles for purchases directly with Delta

3x SkyMiles for purchases made directly with hotels

2x SkyMiles at restaurants

2x SkyMiles at U.S. supermarkets

1x SkyMiles on other eligible purchases

You can earn bonus miles for dining and hotel purchases

The card has solid bonus categories for a co-branded airline card but purely in terms of rewards for spending I think there are still better cards out there for airfare purchases hotel purchases restaurant purchases and grocery store purchases.

No Foreign Transaction Fees

If you are going to put spending on the Delta Platinum Amex the good news is that there are no foreign transaction fees (Rates & Fees) so you can use the card abroad without paying high fees.

Platinum Delta Amex Card Perks & Benefits

The Platinum Delta Credit Card has a nice welcome offer. In general I’d say it could be worth putting spending on the card if you’re trying to earn Medallion elite status with Delta SkyMiles. For most people the reason you’ll want to keep this card long-term is because of the perks and benefits that it offers which for many people will more than offset the annual fee. Let’s go over some of those benefits.

Annual Companion Certificate

Every year upon renewal of your card you can receive a main cabin roundtrip companion certificate. You just have to pay the government-imposed taxes and fees for the companion. This is a great deal that can be worth significantly more than the annual fee in and of itself.

If redeeming the certificate there are some things to be aware of:

It’s valid for roundtrip main cabin travel within the United States and to select destinations in the Caribbean or Central America

You have to pay the government taxes for the second traveler on the reservation

Companion certificates are only valid for travel in the L U T X and V fare classes

You can’t combine a companion certificate with eCoupons

Travel has to be completed by the expiration date of the certificate

You have to pay for the ticket using a Delta Amex card

MQD Boost & MQD Headstart

Receive $2500 Medallion Qualification Dollars each Medallion Qualification Year and earn $1 MQD for each $20 on purchases with your card

First Checked Bag Free

Just for having the Platinum Delta Card you get a first checked bag free which would otherwise cost $30 one-way per person:

This benefit is limited to the primary cardmember and anyone traveling on the same reservation with them (up to nine people)

You don’t have to pay for your flight with your Delta Amex though you do need to have your SkyMiles number in the reservation.

This is a great value given that you’ll usually pay $60 per person roundtrip for a checked bag. If you’re traveling with someone then you’re looking at $120 roundtrip in fees.

Save on checked bag fees with the Delta Platinum Amex

Priority Boarding

Just for having the card you receive Main Cabin 1 priority boarding. This helps maximize your odds of finding space for your carry-on and getting to your seat sooner. Just make sure the primary cardmember’s SkyMiles number is linked to the reservation.

20% Delta Inflight Savings

If you have the Platinum Delta Amex then you can save 20% in the form of a statement credit for eligible pre-purchased meals and in-flight purchases of food alcoholic beverages and audio headsets on Delta flights. Allow 8-12 weeks for the statement credit to post.

Save on inflight purchases with the card

TSA PreCheck Or Global Entry Credit

The Platinum Delta Amex offers a Global Entry or TSA PreCheck credit. This benefit applies once every 4.5 years for the application fee for TSA PreCheck or once every four years for the application fee for Global Entry. This can save you time both at security and immigration and is something I highly recommend signing up for if eligible. (Enrollment required)

Save time at immigration with Global Entry

Delta Pay With Miles

Delta has a Pay With Miles feature where if you have a Delta co-branded credit card you can redeem miles for one cent each toward a Delta flight purchase (in increments of 5000 miles per $50). That’s not the best deal in the world though this is a feature that’s exclusively available to those with an eligible Delta Amex card.

Some people find this to be useful since they can redeem their miles toward flights and then they still earn elite miles for taking those flights.

Pay With Points is a feature that many SkyMiles members value

15% Savings On SkyMiles Award Flights

With the TakeOff 15 perk (exclusively for those with select Delta Amex cards) you can save 15% on the cost of a SkyMiles award ticket when traveling exclusively on Delta. Delta SkyMiles award pricing is dynamic and generally you’ll find that each mile gets you a bit over a cent toward the cost of a ticket.

Saving 15% on these awards is valuable and means that you’ll generally get somewhere around 1.2-1.3 cents of value per mile (or sometimes even more). In many cases this will end up being a better value than using the Pay With Miles option so it’s a real perk of the card.

Amex Offers

One of the great features of Amex cards is access to Amex Offers which offers savings or bonus points on purchases with all kinds of retailers. There’s huge value to be had in getting as many Amex cards as possible so that you can get these offers on multiple cards.

Amex Offers could save you hundreds of dollars per year. You can access these offers by logging into your account and scrolling down to the bottom of your account summary page.

ShopRunner Membership

For having the Delta Platinum Amex you get a ShopRunner membership which gets you free two-day shipping on eligible items at a network of 100+ online stores. You just have to enroll in your complimentary membership and can then start taking advantage of it.

Is The Delta Platinum Amex Worth It?

The Platinum Delta Credit Card isn’t necessarily the best card for the casual Delta flyer and it’s also not a card I’d recommend putting much spending on unless you value the MQMs that you can earn through spending or unless you want to spend money on the card to get an MQD waiver.

However this card has solid perks ranging from a companion certificate to a first checked bag free to priority boarding to savings on flight purchases to access to exclusive award redemption opportunities and more.

Bigger picture is the card worth it though? There are a few things to consider.

Want A Business Credit Card Instead?

If the Delta Platinum Amex sounds interesting to you but you are instead looking for a card for your small business consider the Delta SkyMiles® Platinum Business American Express Card.

Most of the benefits of the card are the same. The only significant difference is that the business card earns 1.5x miles on purchases of over $5000 (up to 50000 bonus miles annually) while the personal card offers 2x miles at restaurants and U.S. supermarkets (both cards offer 3x miles on Delta purchases and hotel purchases).

How Does The Delta Reserve Card Compare?

For the very frequent Delta flyer there’s the Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card (review) which has a $650 annual fee (Rates & Fees). What differentiates this card?

The card offers Delta Sky Club and Amex Centurion Lounge access when traveling on Delta same day. Effective 2/1/25 Reserve Card Members will receive 15 Visits per year to the Delta Sky Club; to earn an unlimited number of Visits each year starting on 2/1/25 the total eligible purchases on the Card must equal $75000 or more between 1/1/24 and 12/31/24 and each calendar year thereafter.

The card offers a companion certificate that is valid for first class as well

Having the card gets you upgrade priority over those in the same elite tier and fare class who don’t have the Reserve Card

Earn Amex Membership Rewards Points

If you are looking to earn Delta SkyMiles through credit card spending then consider using a card earning Amex Membership Rewards points. These points can be transferred to Delta SkyMiles at a 1:1 ratio and you can in many cases earn points at a much faster rate.

For example:

Furthermore earning Amex points gives you more flexibility to redeem in other ways given all the great uses of Membership Rewards points.

The information and associated card details on this page for the American Express Green Card has been collected independently by OMAAT and has not been reviewed or provided by the card issuer.

Bottom Line

The Delta Platinum Amex offers solid perks for those who fly Delta frequently especially Medallion members. For many the annual companion certificate will more than justify the annual fee in and of itself without even accounting for all of the other perks. Some will also find it worth spending money on the card either to get an MQD waiver or to earn MQMs for spending.

Hello the Universe! Whoo!"" shouted Jakkaphong ""Anne"" Jakrajutatip the latest owner of the Miss Universe contest from a stage filled with beauty queens.

Jakkaphong a Thai media tycoon and trans rights activist bought the parent company Miss Universe Organization (MUO) last year. She is the first non-American and first transgender woman to own the 7-decade-old pageant which drew contestants to New Orleans from 83 countries last month.

The competition launched in 1952 was once co-owned by former U.S. President Donald Trump who bought it in in 1996 from ITT Corp. then sold it in 2015 to WME/IMG a talent agency and entertainment company according to Variety.

In October Jakkaphong expanded her business JKN Global Group headquartered in Samut Prakan Thailand by taking over the MUO offices in New York City when she bought the Miss Universe Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants for $20 million.

She's cut a $12.2 million deal with organizers in El Salvador which will host the Miss Universe competition in 2023 for the first time since 1975.

Jakkaphong saw the Miss Universe platform as a promising asset one that will help her fulfill her goal of empowering women and promoting feminism by encouraging all women — transgender married pregnant divorced — to enter the contest.

""I was born as a trans woman"" Jakkaphong told VOA's Thai Service during an exclusive interview in New York last month.

""My life purpose here is to help other people to transform to lead to teach and to inspire people"" said the 43-year-old businesswoman educated in Australia who is a celebrity in Thailand. ""I need to become the inspiration for a lot of people [like] 'you don't give up no matter what and nobody can bring you down once they see you are good.' ""

Describing herself as having been born ""without a golden spoon in my mouth"" Jakkaphong comes from a Thai Chinese upper-middle class family that ran a video rental store which she inherited before starting her own foreign TV content import business. She founded JKN Global Group in 2013.

Jakkaphong advocates for transgender rights in Thailand through her Life Inspired for Thailand Foundation. Since 2019 the group has campaigned for a draft bill to address transgender rights including recognizing legal gender title change for people who go through gender reassignment operations. The draft needs more signatures to move forward to the Thai parliament.

Although considered one of the most LGBTQ+ friendly Asian countries Thailand's laws do not grant equal rights to members of the LGBTQ+ community in title change and marriage.

Jakkaphong believes the Miss Universe pageant comes with enough influence that it may be able to help change the laws in Thailand and other countries that do not yet provide equal rights to LGBTQ+ people.

""I believe that politicians wishing to run as countries' leaders will raise this [gender title change] issue and will make it happen for us… MUO is the platform that helps urge countries to look at this matter"" she said adding that she will soon raise the issue with Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha.

""The [Thai] government is occupied with so many things and of course we don't even know [whether] we will have the same government or not. We will have the election coming up"" in May said Jakkaphong. ""But [gender title change] has to happen one day.""

Despite her belief that the pageant is a force for change Jakkaphong said there's no talk of politics on stage. ""We talk about inspiration. We talk about the power of feminism and that is more important"" she said.

While Jakkaphong acknowledges that ""many countries on the stage don't get along with each other"" the contest is ""about a dream of one woman. You cannot stop her dream no matter where she comes from. We cannot block anybody's dreams particularly young women's.""

She sees those dreams as countering the notion that pageants impose rigid standards of beauty on contestants standards that exclude rather than include and objectify women.

Some 2.4 million people watched the Miss Universe 2022 final competition on January 14 on the U.S.-based Spanish-language Telemundo network according to ustvdb.com. This was the first year the streaming service Roku Channel broadcast the contest. It has yet to disclose viewing numbers.

Nielsen the company that rates the popularity of American television shows reported 2.7 million people watched the 2021 competition a drop from 2019 when 3.8 million people watched the competition. In 2014 the last year of Trump's involvement 8.8 million people watched the contest according to Nielsen.

On the final day of competition January 14 Jakkaphong said ""We can elevate our women to feel strong enough good enough qualified enough and never be objectified again"" before presenting the Transformational Leadership award to Thai entrant Anna Sueangam-iam whose family collects garbage for recycling.

In New York Jakkaphong told VOA’s Thai Service that promoting inclusivity while recognizing beauty lets audiences ""see the diversity… But the brain and the beauty must come together.""

Miss USA R'Bonney Gabriel who on January 14 won the first Miss Universe competition under Jakkaphong's regime is a fashion entrepreneur who designs a line of sustainable clothing.

Becoming an inspiration for others is central to the role of beauty queens said Jakkaphong adding that the Miss Universe pageant helps promote the message of ""becoming the best version of oneself"" and ""becoming so beautifully confident that you would love to lift up the spirit of other human beings.""

Jakkaphong said the pageant under her ownership will continue to be different from its predecessors.

""This is the new paradigm of the beauty competition which I don't see as the beauty competition alone. It's actually a female platform to raise awareness. Therefore the whole world can listen to them.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL3VzL2tvY2gtYmFja2VkLWdyb3VwLWFmcC1yZWFkeS1iYWNrLW5ldy1yZXB1YmxpY2FuLWNhbmRpZGF0ZS0yMDIzLTAyLTA1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Koch-backed group AFP ready to back new Republican candidate,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/world/us/koch-backed-group-afp-ready-back-new-republican-candidate-2023-02-05/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL3dvcmxkL3VzL2tvY2gtYmFja2VkLWdyb3VwLWFmcC1yZWFkeS1iYWNrLW5ldy1yZXB1YmxpY2FuLWNhbmRpZGF0ZS0yMDIzLTAyLTA1L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xMS1iZXN0LWNiZC1zdG9ja3MtYnV5LTE3MTA0NDA3Mi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,11 Best CBD Stocks To Buy Now,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy8xMS1iZXN0LWNiZC1zdG9ja3MtYnV5LTE3MTA0NDA3Mi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025628F7EC20>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The suspected Chinese surveillance balloon that violated American airspace this week has fueled a diplomatic crisis with the postponement of Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s planned trip to Beijing.

But the two countries have a long history of spying on each other.

The US has sought to collect its own intelligence about the Chinese government using methods that include flying surveillance aircraft over disputed islands claimed by Beijing human sources and signal intercepts.

Still American officials have sought to distinguish US actions from what they say is the more brazen espionage being carried out by the Chinese government.

US officials say Beijing uses every tool at its disposal to gain a strategic advantage over the United States its primary geopolitical rival. But Chinese officials say a similar thing – Beijing has in the past repeatedly accused the US of espionage.

China denies that the balloon currently above the US is involved in any kind of espionage claiming it is a “civilian airship used for research mainly meteorological purposes” that has been blown off course.

Here’s what we know about how China spies on the US:

Balloons and satellites

While the suspected Chinese balloon spotted in the skies above multiple US states this week prompted an uproar from Republicans and Democrats alike it is not the first time this kind of activity has been observed.

A US official said Friday there had been similar incidents over Hawaii and Guam in recent years while another official on Thursday said “Instances of this activity have been observed over the past several years including prior to this administration.”

US officials have said the flight path of the latest balloon first spotted over Montana on Thursday could potentially take it over a “number of sensitive sites.” They say they are taking steps to “protect against foreign intelligence collection.”

What’s less clear is why Chinese spies would want to use a balloon rather than a satellite to gather information.

Using balloons as spy platforms goes back to the early days of the Cold War. Since then the US has used hundreds of them to monitor its adversaries said Peter Layton a fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia and former Royal Australian Air Force officer.

But with the advent of modern satellite technology enabling the gathering of overflight intelligence data from space the use of surveillance balloons had been going out of fashion.

Or at least until now.

Recent advances in the miniaturization of electronics mean the floating intelligence platforms may be making a comeback in the modern spying toolkit.

“Balloon payloads can now weigh less and so the balloons can be smaller cheaper and easier to launch” than satellites Layton said.

Cellphone towers

Outside Malmstrom Air Force Base in central Montana spread across 13800 square miles of open plains more than 100 intercontinental ballistic missiles stand at the ready buried deep underground in missile silos. These Minuteman III rockets are capable of delivering nuclear warheads at least 6000 miles away and are part of the US Strategic Command which oversees the country’s nuclear and missile arsenal.

Nestled among these silos are clusters of cell phone towers operated by a small rural wireless carrier. According to Federal Communications Commission filings those cell towers use Chinese technology that security experts have warned in recent years could allow China to gather intelligence while also potentially mounting network attacks in the areas surrounding this and other sensitive military installations.

Huawei the Chinese company that makes the tower technology is shunned by the major US wireless carriers and the federal government over national security concerns.

Yet its technology is widely deployed by a number of small federally subsidized wireless carriers that buy cheaper Chinese-made hardware to place atop their cell towers. In some cases those cellular networks provide exclusive coverage to rural areas close to US military bases CNN previously reported.

In 2018 the heads of major US intelligence agencies – including the FBI and CIA – warned Americans against using Huawei devices and products. Security experts say that having its technology deployed so close to the nation’s arsenal of ICBMs could pose a far greater threat.

Land purchases

In 2017 the Chinese government offered to spend $100 million to build an ornate Chinese garden at the National Arboretum in Washington DC. Complete with temples pavilions and a 70-foot white pagoda the project thrilled local officials who hoped it would attract thousands of tourists every year.

But when US counterintelligence officials began digging into the details they found numerous red flags. The pagoda they noted would have been strategically placed on one of the highest points in Washington just two miles from the US Capitol a perfect spot for signals intelligence collection multiple sources told CNN last year.

Chinese officials wanted to build the pagoda with materials shipped to the US in diplomatic pouches which US Customs officials are barred from examining the sources said.

Federal officials quietly killed the project before construction started.

The canceled garden is just one of the projects that has caught the eye of the FBI and other federal agencies during what US security officials say has been a dramatic escalation of Chinese espionage on US soil over the past decade.

Since 2017 federal officials have investigated Chinese land purchases near critical infrastructure shut down a regional consulate believed by the US government to be a hotbed of Chinese spies and stonewalled what they saw as efforts to plant listening devices near sensitive military and government facilities.

Some of the things the FBI uncovered pertained to Chinese-made Huawei equipment atop cell towers near US military bases in the rural Midwest.

According to multiple sources the FBI determined the equipment was capable of capturing and disrupting highly restricted Defense Department communications including those used by US Strategic Command which oversees the country’s nuclear weapons.

Students business people and scientists

CNN has also reported that Beijing has been leaning on expatriate Chinese scientists businesspeople and even students in the US according to current and former US intelligence officials lawmakers and several experts.

There have been a number of high-profile arrests. In January a former graduate student in Chicago was sentenced to eight years in prison for spying for the Chinese government by gathering information on engineers and scientists in the United States.

Ji Chaoqun a Chinese national who came to the US to study electrical engineering at the Illinois Institute of Technology in 2013 and later enlisted in the US Army Reserves was arrested in 2018.

The 31-year-old was convicted last September of acting illegally as an agent of China’s Ministry of State Security (MSS) and of making a material false statement to the US Army.

According to the Justice Department Ji was tasked with providing an intelligence officer with biographical information on individuals for potential recruitment as Chinese spies. The individuals included Chinese nationals who were working as engineers and scientists in the US some of whom worked for American defense contractors.

Ji’s spying was part of an effort by Chinese intelligence to obtain access to advanced aerospace and satellite technologies being developed by US companies the Justice Department said.

Ji was working at the direction of Xu Yanjun a deputy division director at the Jiangsu provincial branch of the MMS the DOJ statement said.

Xu a career intelligence officer was sentenced last year to 20 years in prison for plotting to steal trade secrets from several US aviation and aerospace companies. Xu was also the first Chinese spy extradited to the US for trial after being detained in Belgium in 2018 following an FBI investigation.

The culmination of the equity conversion plan comes more than a year after the government made the initial decision and serves as a breather for Vodafone Idea with a debt burden of ₹2.2 trillion as of September 2022. The loss-making telco has been struggling to raise ₹20000 crore funds via debt and equity since 2021. “We had sought a firm commitment that the Aditya Birla Group would run the company and bring necessary investments. Birlas have agreed and hence we have agreed to convert. We want India to be a three-player market plus BSNL and ensure healthy competition for consumers"" Union telecom minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said in a statement.

In a stock exchange filing Vodafone Idea said “Ministry of communications government of India has in line with the reforms and support package for telecom sector communicated earlier and the conversion option exercised by the company as provided for therein passed an order today i.e. 3 February 2023 under section 62(4) of the Companies Act 2013 directing the company to convert the NPV of the interest related to deferment of spectrum auction instalments and AGR dues into equity shares to be issued to the government of India."" The government has directed that 16.13 billion shares of a face value of ₹10 each be issued to it and the company will take “all necessary actions forthwith"" for the issue Vodafone Idea added.

According to an official aware of the matter government officials held discussions with Vodafone Idea executives on the company’s business plan to stay competitive before agreeing to proceed with the equity conversion.

“There was a delay; we wanted them to show us a clear business plan. We’ve held discussions with them and they’ve shared it with us. Discussions were also on to get bankers on board"" the official said on condition of anonymity.

While the government had asked the telco to bring in more equity from promoters or from external investors the conversion was not contingent on them raising funds the official added. Mint was the first to report on 3 November that the government wanted promoters to infuse further capital and a business plan to revive the firm for the government to proceed with the equity conversion.

Under the equity conversion plan proposed in January 2022 the government would have become Vodafone Idea’s single-largest shareholder with a 33% stake and promoters’ holding would have reduced to 50% from almost 75%. However it is unclear what the final shareholding of the Centre will be as many changes have taken place in the past year.

In March promoters Vodafone Group and Aditya Birla Group pumped in ₹4500 crore—part of the proposed ₹25000 crore fund-raise from investors—and in July Euro Pacific Securities a Vodafone Group Plc entity brought in ₹436 crore more.

The government had given another option to Vodafone Idea to convert the interest on moratorium of paying adjusted gross revenue or AGR dues of ₹8837 crore pertaining to FY18 and FY19 into equity to be owned by the government. Vodafone Idea decided against this.

The struggling carrier has been unable to make payments to its tower vendors Indus Towers and American Tower Corp. (ATC). It has sought easier and staggered payment terms from them while offering optionally convertible debentures of ₹1600 crore to ATC and will use the funds to pay back some of the pending dues to the tower operator for renting its assets to provide mobile phone services in India. At present Vodafone Idea owes more than ₹3000 crore to ATC and an additional estimated ₹7000 crore to Indus Towers the world’s largest tower provider.

The equity conversion had been hanging fire since January 2022 when the No. 3 carrier agreed to the government proposal to take the option as part of the reforms package announced in November 2021.

This year seniors must take their required minimum distribution or RMD from IRAs 401(k)s and 403 (b) plans at 73 up from 72 — thanks to retirement legislation President Biden signed in December. That will extend even further to age 75 in 2033.

By delaying withdrawals your investments continue to grow tax-free and you continue to sock more tax-deferred dollars away. So waiting even longer can be a financial boon for those who can afford it.

Here's how that can happen.

Skirting the RMD

One exception that may let you push your RMD from an employer-sponsored 401(k) or (403(b) plan even further down the line is simply not retiring.

If you continue to work past age 73 and do not own more than 5% of the business you work for most employer plans allow you to defer your RMD until April 1 of the year after you retire from that employer’s plan according to IRS Publication 575.

The IRS has no clear rules on the number of hours you need to work for you to use the still-working exemption so a part-time position as you phase into retirement may work if your employer considers you an active employee.

But it can get tricky. As mentioned you can’t avoid your RMD if you own more than 5% of the company. And that’s not as straightforward as it seems. For example it’s not just your personal ownership in a business; any ownership in the business by a parent spouse child or grandchild also is included in determining whether you meet that criteria.

And when you decide to retire officially will make a difference in when your RMD must start. Timing matters. If you’re planning to retire at the end of the year try to push your departure ahead to January. That way you can push back starting your RMDs until April 1 of the next calendar year.

Of course you’ll need to check your 401(k) plan provisions with your human resources department and run it by a tax professional.

Here's an important caveat: The pause button does not apply to all pre-tax funded retirement accounts — only to your current employer’s plan. So you’re still on the hook to take an RMD from any IRAs (including SEP and SIMPLE IRAs) or any tax-deferred retirement accounts you own in a former employer’s plan.

To Roth or not to Roth

Another strategy to steer clear of the RMD rule is to convert a traditional IRA or part of it into a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA doesn’t have required minimum distributions during the lifetime of the original owner and your heirs may inherit the assets tax-free. Plus there are no income restrictions on who can convert eligible IRA assets.

“Many taxpayers do Roth conversions between retirement and when they must take RMDs when they’re in lower tax brackets” Ed Slott a certified public accountant in New York and an expert on IRAs told Yahoo Finance.

There are however big factors to consider.

With a Roth conversion you pay federal income taxes now on the conversion amount but none on any future earnings as long as when withdrawals are taken the account has been open for five years and you’re age 59½ or over or disabled. If you haven’t met the requirements you'll get hit with a 10% penalty on top of the tax.

Some key conversion considerations: If you expect higher taxes down the road this could be a win for you. The timing could also align if your taxable income has dropped or your retirement accounts have taken a dive in value which may have happened over the last year.

That said the upfront cost can be considerable since you’ll pay federal income taxes on the conversion now. Weigh your options carefully.

Check out five important facts you may not know about heart attacks:

They're pervasive. Every year in the United States about 805000 people have a heart attack. That's about one every 40 seconds. Of these 605000 are a first heart attack and 200000 are in people who have already had at least one heart attack.2 They're often caused by high LDL-C. LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) is often referred to as ""bad"" cholesterol. When your body contains high levels of LDL-C LDL builds up in the walls of your blood vessels which can lead to atherosclerosis. This increases your risk for health problems such as a heart attack.5 A low LDL-C level is optimal for your health and it's even more important if you've had one or more heart attacks.6 Their symptoms might not be what you expect. In addition to the tell-tale signs of a heart attack (e.g. chest pain shortness of breath and pain or discomfort in one or both arms) there are other symptoms that you may not associate with heart attacks.7 Waking up in a cold sweat and experiencing nausea and/or vomiting may be symptoms of another ailment but they can also be signs of a heart attack. 78

may be symptoms of another ailment but they can also be signs of a heart attack. In movies we see people clutching their arms or chest in pain but did you know pain is also common in the jaw neck and back ? 7

? Fatigue and exhaustion often come into play during a heart attack because of the stress of your heart pumping an area where blood flow is blocked. This symptom is generally more common in women than men.9 They can be silent. One in five people have a silent heart attack which is a heart attack with few if any symptoms and sometimes the symptoms aren't recognized as a heart attack at all.2 Those who have experienced this might think in the moment that they had heartburn the flu or strained a chest muscle.10 Research shows that having one silent heart attack increases an individual's risk of having another heart attack and increases the risk of complications like heart failure.10 They may be preventable so act now and talk to your doctor. LDL-C is the main culprit for blockages in the coronary arteries but an LDL-C test can help determine if you're at risk for a heart attack.11 There are ways to help lower your LDL-C including: Maintaining a healthy diet. A healthy diet is another way to help lower your LDL-C. Eating nutrient-dense foods that have vitamins minerals and fiber is a better choice than eating processed foods that may be high in saturated and trans fats. 12

A healthy diet is another way to help lower your LDL-C. Eating nutrient-dense foods that have vitamins minerals and fiber is a better choice than eating processed foods that may be high in saturated and trans fats. Staying active. Being active every day is a great way to help lower your LDL-C. Studies have shown that at least 150 minutes per week of physical activity can help lower LDL-C. 12

Being active every day is a great way to help lower your LDL-C. Studies have shown that at least 150 minutes per week of physical activity can help lower LDL-C. Talking to your doctor about the right medication if you have high LDL-C. If you're on medication post-heart attack and your LDL-C remains higher than 55 mg/dL your current treatment may not be enough.13

If you or someone you know is having a heart attack call emergency services (911 in the United States).

Antibodies constitute a staggering $145 billion annual market—an amount projected to almost double by 2026. Consequently patents covering antibodies are among the most valuable in the patent system. But antibody patents are being struck down left and right victims of the Federal Circuit’s recent shift to strengthen two doctrinal areas of patent law: enablement and the written description requirement. For each the Federal Circuit has heightened requirements that patentees disclose or teach how to make and use the “full scope” of their inventions.

There are good reasons to be skeptical of the Federal Circuit’s attack on genus claims in chemistry generally. But it seems to be a particular problem for antibodies. Applying the Federal Circuit’s reinvigorated written description and enablement requirements to antibodies and their chemical structure fits poorly with the science underlying the molecules themselves. Immune-receptor production a semi-random and galactically expansive process produces antibodies that are startlingly different in both structure and function. There is no way to describe genus claims to antibodies that satisfy the court’s current tests. The science simply doesn’t allow it. At the same time this change in the Federal Circuit’s jurisprudence is a legitimate reaction to some of the problems with the long-standing (and long-permitted) practice of claiming antibodies in functional terms. Functional claiming can lead to overbroad patents that stifle future innovation as it has done in the software industry. Perhaps the Federal Circuit is wary of a similar result in biotechnology. Fortunately we think there is a middle ground. A new (or really quite old) form of patent-claim drafting would give inventors effective control over true substitutes without giving them the power to block real improvements: means-plus-function claims and infringement by the equivalents. Those doctrines limit patentees to claiming only the specific structural features of antibodies they both possessed and described but also entitle them to assert their patents against antibodies with equivalent functions but different structural characteristics. If the economics of intellectual property center on balancing a need for protection beyond the literal invention with a desire to allow improvements this seems a step in the right—or at least in a doctrinally permissible and economically sensible—direction.

Whether patentees go for such a solution remains to be seen. Recent empirical evidence on antibody claims has yet to document such a shift. Patent attorneys may need to get over their historical reluctance to writing their claims in such a fashion. Our solution won’t give patentees everything they want. But they just might find it gives them what they need.

Introduction

Antibodies are the backbone of modern biotechnology. They are the workhorses of molecular-biology research the principal component in numerous diagnostic tests and the heart of both the immunity provided by COVID-19 vaccines and of the single most effective COVID therapy. Long before “antibodies” became a household word during the COVID-19 pandemic engineered antibodies were central to many of the most important and most valuable medical tests and therapies of the past thirty years. Annual revenue from just the top ten best-selling antibody drugs in 2019 reached $79.1 billion—almost double that of the global market for movies and music combined.

Patent law has long given antibodies broad protection allowing an inventor who identifies an antibody that targets a particular antigen of interest to claim ownership over not just the particular antibody they developed but over a genus of antibodies attracted to the same antigen. An inventor who created an antibody that bound to say tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)—the basis of three of the six top-selling antibody therapies—could claim that antibody and almost all other antibodies that bound to it. In part this claim practice was one of necessity. Unlike typical “small-molecule” drugs scientists had long identified antibodies not by their precise molecular structure but by what they did. Indeed characterizing antibodies atom by atom was both impractical and pointless—akin to describing a fighter jet by listing every nut and bolt. “Functional claiming” the ownership of “any device that performs [a] function” was not only permitted but a norm for antibody patents. The form of patent claims thus followed their function.

Things have changed. In the laboratory it is now easier to identify the physical sequence of a newly discovered antibody. But at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit no antibody patent in over a decade has survived a challenge based on overbreadth and inadequate disclosure with the court regularly throwing out billion-dollar jury verdicts in favor of those patents. Mainly the patents have fallen victim to patent law’s “written description” requirement the doctrine that requires patentees to disclose “enough” examples of what they invented to show a “person having ordinary skill in the art” (a PHOSITA or a reasonable expert) that the inventor was in possession of the invention. That doctrine is intended to prevent a patentee from “gun jumping”—filing for a patent application before they have actually nailed down the invention. Emboldened perhaps by this expansion of the written description doctrine the Federal Circuit has also invalidated antibody patents on the related doctrinal ground of enablement even though the technology is now easier to find and apply.

Because the written description doctrine prevents inventors from filing patent applications too early the doctrine has long operated with the conceit that the more knowledge a PHOSITA possesses about the field the less a patent must show to demonstrate possession of that invention. With antibodies however a paradox has emerged. In the early days of the industry when scientists often knew little about the precise molecular and genetic structures of antibodies and lacked tools to easily find them the law permitted broad patents covering any antibody that bound to a particular target with a certain specificity; identifying those characteristics was the only practical way to describe newly discovered antibodies. Now that scientists understand the chemical structure of antibodies better—including an appreciation for just how genetically diverse antibodies are even those that bind to a single target—functional patent claims to antibodies’ antigens are routinely being held invalid for failing the enablement or written description doctrines. Today scientists know that the discovery of one or even dozens of antibodies that bind to a particular target with a particular specificity doesn’t exclude the possibility that many other antibodies with different structures do the same. Instead of requiring scientists to disclose more information when their colleagues start out knowing less patent law now requires them to disclose more information about each invention when their colleagues know more. This development cuts against patent law’s precept that “there is an inverse correlation between the level of skill and knowledge in the art and the specificity of disclosure necessary to satisfy the written description requirement.” We call this the antibody patent paradox.

The antibody patent paradox may be part of a broader shift in patent doctrine what one of us has called “the death of genus claims.” Or it may be an extension of the concerns about the abuse of functional claiming in other areas like software. Or it could be the result of trying to fit one of the most complex biological molecules we know in the single convoluted sentence that is a patent claim. Or perhaps it is simply the result of a circumstance in which the more we learn the more we learn what we don’t know. We explore all of these possibilities.

Regardless of the explanation the antibody patent paradox lies at the heart of several critical questions in patent policy: how broad patent claims should be to encourage invention; whether patent law is and should be technology-specific; and how we accommodate follow-on innovation after an initial pioneering disclosure. If we get those questions wrong we could end up with a second paradox—how the patent-fueled success of antibody technology made it impossible to get the very kinds of patents that drove innovation in the first place. As a matter of innovation policy we think the end of functional antibody claims is a problem but the likely effects on innovation are complicated. We suggest some possible middle ground that might save narrower antibody genus claims.

In Part I we explain the science of antibodies how it has changed and why antibodies are so complex. In Part II we discuss the parallel history of the law beginning with broad protection for functional antibody claims and ending with the current period of hostility to antibody patents. Part III considers several possible explanations for this shift none of which are completely satisfactory. In Part IV we explain how the antibody patent paradox is central to many of the current policy debates in patent law and we offer some guidance as to how to resolve the paradox. We conclude by suggesting broader implications for the written description doctrine and patent claims for other complex technologies.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzAyLzA0L3dpbGwtdGhlc2UtMy1wb3RlbnRpYWwtYmxvY2tidXN0ZXItZHJ1Z3MtbGlmdC1icmlzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will These 3 Potential Blockbuster Drugs Lift Bristol Myers Squibb?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzAyLzA0L3dpbGwtdGhlc2UtMy1wb3RlbnRpYWwtYmxvY2tidXN0ZXItZHJ1Z3MtbGlmdC1icmlzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025627A1CF10>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

On the one hand people are spending approximately 80% of their life in confined and closed places i.e. in homes and offices but on the other hand almost 50% of the natural background radiation dose to humans originates from the inhalation of these gases and their airborne progenies12. Radon is a radioactive gas. It is the decay product of 226Ra having half-life of 3.84 days and an alpha particle emitting inert radionuclide (5.49 MeV). It is naturally occurring nuclides and considered as the hazardous gas for human living environment as alpha particles can cause substantial damage to a cell. The decay products of radon may be deposited in the lung tissues in the heterogeneous pattern1 and known as the second leading source of lung cancer after smoking2. Therefore knowing the behavior and distribution of indoor radon that is the exact levels of radon at different points and areas especially in breathing zones in residential buildings is essential for the purpose of dose assessment345. Apart from this indoor radon exposure has been estimated to account for approximately 9% of all lung cancer deaths and 2% of all cancer deaths in Europe6. In Hungary regarding the new updated standards of the European Union Basic Safety Standards7 it is recommended that the annual average indoor radon concentration should not be higher than 300 Bq m−3 in dwellings or workplaces7 and the member countries should prepare and continuously review a Radon Action Plan to reduce the lung cancer risk of the radon exposure. Therefore the indoor radon concentration should be monitored and control in dwelling and workplaces.

Since radon comes from the natural decay of uranium that is found in nearly all soils it typically moves up through the ground to the air above and into your home through cracks and other holes in the foundation. Your home traps radon inside where it can build up. Any home may have a radon problem. This means new and old homes well-sealed and drafty homes and homes with or without basements. Radon from soil gas is the main cause of radon problems. Sometimes radon enters the home through well water. In many of homes the building materials can give off radon too. However building materials rarely cause radon problems by themselves. Hence being a noble gas radon easily gets released from the source term to the pores (emanation) and subsequently from the pores to the outside environment (exhalation).

A number of techniques have been used to measure the radon concentrations and their decay products in the environment including Active and Passive methods. The devices and methods may vary over a wide range of grab sampling time-integrated sampling (short-term and long-term) and continuums sampling (known as real-time radon monitoring). However radon measure devices are also classified differently based on their used method of radon monitoring in addition to other classification i.e. electrostatic collection of decay products (RAD7 Tesla TSR2 EQF3220) ionizing chamber device (AlphaGUARD) photo-multiplier counter and scintillation (Liquid scintillation or scintillation cell) radon absorption (active charcoal) etched track detectors (CR-39 LR115). We have to decide what technique to use on the basic of the feasibility and cost of the measurement as well as accuracy and applicability of the technique.

In case of standard problems for measuring of indoor radon concentrations indeed radon measurements in homes are easy to perform but need to be based on standardized (e.g. national) protocols to ensure accurate and consistent measurements. They do not address all technical aspects of measurement device technology quality assurance or techniques to specifically identify radon sources such as radon in water supplies building materials or relative to the possession and handling of radioactive materials. In addition high variation of indoor radon makes short-term measurements unreliable for most applications. Another problem is related to the type of detector which should be carefully selected since it influences the cost of measurement per dwelling and therefore the cost of a radon program on a national level.

In confined areas a vital factor with regard to human health indoor air quality and energy efficiency is the ventilation rate since the degree of exposure can be significant especially in buildings with poor ventilation systems where radon gas which is heavier than air can easily accumulate and reach lethal activity concentrations in terms of human health. It is worth mentioning that ventilation does not directly affect occupant health but the rate of ventilation affects indoor air pollutant concentrations that in turn modify the occupants’ health. Previous studies have reported that indoor radon and thoron concentrations are related to environmental meteorological parameters and building ventilation conditions by applying numerical and experimental methods as well as different pieces of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software as analytical and powerful tools891011121314. For instance Zhou et al. applied the finite difference method to derive discrete equations before linking them to the commercial FU-JITSU/a-FLOW code to study the concentrations and their distributions of 222Rn and 220Rn as well as their progenies in a model room8. Rabi et al. implemented a 222Rn distribution inside a typical Moroccan room using Fortran software12. Chauhan et al. and Agarwal et al. in this regard also used the software Fluidyn MP based on the Finite Volume Method (FVM)1114. As a result appropriate ventilation could reduce indoor pollution due to radon exhalation from the ground or from contaminated building materials.

Radon after the release from the walls and floor gets distributed in indoor environment. Understanding its distribution is important to predict the spatial and temporal variations of levels which can ultimately be used for dose calculations and exposure control research. As the time spent indoor is large enough; understanding prediction and measurement of indoor radon distribution becomes quite important. In addition the concentration level and spatial distribution of radon may be affected by the dwelling's ventilation conditions. The main purpose of this study is to estimate the indoor radon distribution in a typical naturally ventilated test room under the following two scenarios: closed- and open-door conditions. The need of the study is the prediction of activity level and to study the effect of natural ventilation on indoor radon. Therefore the inlet velocity was calculated on the basis of the ventilation rate. Hence based on the American Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Standard 62.1 ventilation standards in buildings are suggested to meet indoor air quality regulations which take into account the volume or area and the number of inhabitants15. Furthermore Yoshino et al. reported that the minimum air exchange rate (it is the number of times that the total air volume in a room or space is completely removed and replaced in an hour) in the majority of European countries is 1 h−1 which is also in accordance with Japanese regulations concerning air ex-change rates in buildings16. By taking into consideration the aforementioned criteria a different range of ventilation rates from 0.3 to 4.3 h−1 (also reported by Zhou et al.8 and Agarwal et al.14) was considered and assessed in the current study. The radon source term as a key input parameter in the CFD software (ANSYS Fluent 2020 R1 based on the FVM) has also been measured by an accumulation chamber technique for samples of cement (comprehensively described in Kocsis et al.17 and Shahrokhi et al.18) before the simulations took into account the room geometry.

“Roberto Velayo Ongpin passed away in his sleep last night (February 4) in Balesin Island” Apa said in a statement sent to Rappler.

“He is survived by his wife Monica Arellano his children Stephen Anna Michelle and Julian and four grandchildren two of whom he got to play with before he went to sleep last night. His remains will be brought to Manila” he added.

Apa said that an official statement will be released containing the wake details when the family decides on it.

Who is Bobby Ongpin?

Ongpin was one of the richest Filipinos according to Forbes Magazine. In 2022 Forbes Magazine named Ongpin as the 23rd richest Filipino with a net worth of $830 million (P44.5 billion).

Ongpin graduated cum laude in Business Administration from the Ateneo de Manila University. He was a Certified Public Accountant and had an MBA from Harvard Business School.

During the administration of the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos Ongpin served as the minister of Commerce and Industry now the Department of Trade and Industry. Because of his position he was tagged as a Marcos “crony.”

In an interview with ANC in 2011 Ongpin said that he tried his “best to escape from being conscripted into the Cabinet.”

“I never sought the position” he said.

“In fact when he called me I was in London. He called at 4 o’clock in the morning well it was one of the assistants who called and said ‘The President wants to talk to you.’ I said ‘It’s 4 o’clock in the morning.’ So I hung up. Then he called again” Ongpin recounted.

In the same interview Ongpin said that the assasination of Ninoy Aquino was “probably the most difficult time for the Marcos government.”

“It was a very difficult time in the sense that the commercial banks that had lent us money pulled out their money overnight. I remember that was around $770 million we lost overnight. For a time the reserves of the Philippines were down to $14 million. The total international reserves now is $75 billion” he added.

Ongpin said that he resented being part of Marcos Sr.’s administration but then he didn’t walk away because he thought he was already making a difference that time.

“The whole world believes he was a bad guy. But I think he was a simple man he never coveted wealth for wealth’s sake” he said.

Ongpin said he was hurt by being tagged as a Marcos crony.

Ongpin was known as the owner of the Balesin island an “opulent all-exclusive and members-only” resort located 21 kilometers southwest of Polillo Quezon Province. He also chaired Alphaland a high-end property developer that delisted in 2014 after a messy split with a UK investment group according to a Forbes report.

In 2016 then President Rodrigo Duterte singled him out as an example of the oligarchs his administration wanted to do away with. Duterte described Ongpin as a businessman close to people in power and implied he used his political influence to strengthen his businesses.

In the same year the Court of Appeals stopped the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) from enforcing its en banc decision on Ongpin’s insider trading case involving Philex Mining Corporation shares in 2009.

The SEC had barred the businessman from joining the board of any publicly listed company and fined him P174 million for insider trading. Ongpin was the chairman of two listed firms – PhilWeb Corporation and Atok Big Wedge Incorporated.

Ongpin also served as the director of San Miguel Corporation PAL Holdings Inc. and Petron Corporation. – Rappler.com",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxzdGFyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIzLzAyLzA1LzIyNDI3NDcvYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtcm9iZXJ0by1vbmdwaW4tODbSAVdodHRwczovL3d3dy5waGlsc3Rhci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMy8wMi8wNS8yMjQyNzQ3L2JpbGxpb25haXJlLXJvYmVydG8tb25ncGluLTg2L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billionaire Roberto Ongpin 86,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBoaWxzdGFyLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIzLzAyLzA1LzIyNDI3NDcvYmlsbGlvbmFpcmUtcm9iZXJ0by1vbmdwaW4tODbSAVdodHRwczovL3d3dy5waGlsc3Rhci5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvMjAyMy8wMi8wNS8yMjQyNzQ3L2JpbGxpb25haXJlLXJvYmVydG8tb25ncGluLTg2L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002562F127970>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Apple has secured the top spot on Forbes' annual list of the World's Most Admired Companies taking first place for the 16th consecutive year.

In a repeat of the last 15 editions of the list Apple has managed to maintain its position at number one on the list compiled by Forbes. Once again Apple pulls ahead of many major organizations including Amazon and Microsoft tied for second place and Berkshire Hathaway in fourth.

JP Morgan Chase makes it to fifth place on the list ahead of Walt Disney in sixth. Retailer Costco manages to get seventh place Pfizer hits eighth Alphabet lands at ninth and American Express rounds out the top ten.

The rankings are those of corporate reputation based on a poll of approximately 3700 corporate executives directors and analysts.

Broken down into subcategories Apple manages to dominate across the board thanks to its overall score of 8.65 points. Naturally it tops the Computers industry rank just as it did in 2022.

The other categories all of which Apple was the winner of include Innovation People Management Use of Corporate Assets Social Responsibility Quality of Management Financial Soundness Long-Term Investment Value Quality of Products and Services and Global Competitiveness.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vbWluZGEtemV0bGluL3RoZS0xLXdvcmQtYXBwbGUtY2VvLXRpbS1jb29rLWhhcy1ub3Qtc2FpZC13aHktaXRzLWEtbGVzc29uLWZvci1ldmVyeS1sZWFkZXIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's the Word Apple CEO Tim Cook Has Not Said and Why It's a Lesson for Every Leader,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/the-1-word-apple-ceo-tim-cook-has-not-said-why-its-a-lesson-for-every-leader.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluYy5jb20vbWluZGEtemV0bGluL3RoZS0xLXdvcmQtYXBwbGUtY2VvLXRpbS1jb29rLWhhcy1ub3Qtc2FpZC13aHktaXRzLWEtbGVzc29uLWZvci1ldmVyeS1sZWFkZXIuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vZ2VuZXJhbC9lZHVjYXRpb24vMjMvMDIvMzA3MTY1MzAvaWYteW91LWJvdWdodC0xLTAwMC1pbi1hcHBsZS1zdG9jay13aGVuLXRoZS1pcG9kLXdhcy1yZWxlYXNlZC1oZXJlcy1ob3ctbXVjaC15b3VkLWhhdmUtbm930gEtaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVuemluZ2EuY29tL2FtcC9jb250ZW50LzMwNzE2NTMw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,If You Bought $1000 In Apple Stock When The iPod Was Released Here's How Much You'd Have Now - Apple (N,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Too Many Requests for url: https://www.benzinga.com/general/education/23/02/30716530/if-you-bought-1-000-in-apple-stock-when-the-ipod-was-released-heres-how-much-youd-have-now on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZW56aW5nYS5jb20vZ2VuZXJhbC9lZHVjYXRpb24vMjMvMDIvMzA3MTY1MzAvaWYteW91LWJvdWdodC0xLTAwMC1pbi1hcHBsZS1zdG9jay13aGVuLXRoZS1pcG9kLXdhcy1yZWxlYXNlZC1oZXJlcy1ob3ctbXVjaC15b3VkLWhhdmUtbm930gEtaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmVuemluZ2EuY29tL2FtcC9jb250ZW50LzMwNzE2NTMw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vYXUubGlmZXN0eWxlLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9maW5hbmNlL25ld3MvMS1yZXRhaWxlcnMtb2ZmZXJpbmctZGlzY291bnRzLWhpZ2gtMDM0MjIwOTg1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,UPDATE 1-Retailers offering discounts on high-end iPhones in China,"(Adds figures for China smartphone sales in 2022)

SHANGHAI Feb 6 (Reuters) - Third party retailers in China are offering discounts of as much as 10% on Apple Inc's iPhone 14 Pro amid sluggish demand for smartphones.

Electronics vendors JD.Com Inc and Suning are currently selling the iPhone 14 Pro basic model for 7199 yuan ($1062) checks of JD.com's app and Suning's website showed. That is 800 yuan cheaper than the standard price on Apple's official China website.

A number of other authorised Apple third party sellers are offering similar discounts on the iPhone 14 pro and Pro Max Reuters checks of promotions on social media showed.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Apple will occasionally allow partner vendors in China to offer discounts on its phones to spur demand.

""The return of price cut even for the best-selling iPhone 14 models is not a good sign for demand"" Jeffries analyst Edison Lee wrote in a note to clients adding that several Android brands have also cut prices.

China's smartphone sales in 2022 clocked in at 286 million the lowest level in a decade with sales in the fourth-quarter sliding 14% due to poor demand according to research firm Canalys.

Apple sales tumbled 24% in the quarter Canalys said in part due to an early release of the iPhone 14 series and in part due to supply chain issues caused by worker unrest at contract manufacturer Foxconn.

The China Securities Journal first reported the price cuts on Sunday. ($1 = 6.7782 Chinese yuan) (Reporting by Josh Horwitz; Editing by Edwina Gibbs)"

These could then be used in the chemical industry for the energy-efficient separation of complex chemical mixtures or to clean up waste streams further adding to the environmental appeal of the process.

Polymeric membranes could be great partners for addressing many sustainability challenges says Malinalli Ramírez Martínez a Ph.D. student who led the research in Suzana Nunes’ group at KAUST. Thanks to their selectively permeable porous structure they can reduce the environmental footprint of industrial separations help in the treatment of waste effluent and create access to fresh water she says.

“However traditional membrane fabrication approaches mostly use pristine fossil-based nonrenewable materials which has a negative environmental impact and contradicts the sustainability benefits” Ramírez Martínez says.

“We wanted to take polymeric membrane sustainability one step further by replacing some of the conventional materials used for their fabrication with bio-based solvents and waste plastics following the principles of circular economy and green chemistry.”

Polyolefin plastics make up almost half of all discarded items in plastic waste streams. “Polyolefins are very popular due to their low cost and high thermal and chemical stability” Ramírez Martínez says. “We find them in food packaging reusable bags shampoo bottles toys and many more products.”

These same properties make polyolefins attractive for producing hydrophobic microporous membranes for oil purification and other industrial purification processes. “However the main challenges for processing polyolefins into porous membranes are the high temperatures required to dissolve them — commonly between 140 and 250 degrees Celsius — and the limited range of solvents that can be used most of them fossil-fuel based.”

Two bio-based solvents can significantly improve the sustainability of this process the team has now shown. “We found that terpenes — naturally abundant renewable solvents derived from nonfood biomass — could dissolve polyolefins at just 130 degrees Celsius” Ramírez Martínez says. “Secondly using these solvents we successfully made polypropylene membranes using plastic waste from food packaging transforming single-use plastics into high-performance materials.”

These membranes proved adept at separating the water-in-oil emulsions that can be generated by certain industrial processes. “The rejection values and oil purity we recorded were comparable to state-of-the-art membranes reported in the literature” Ramírez Martínez says. “We consider it a great achievement to have proved that membranes prepared from plastic waste can have a competitive performance compared to those made from pristine materials.”

Jennifer Flewellen — who was in the coma at the Mary Free Bed Rehabilitation Hospital following a car crash in 2017 — woke up suddenly in 2022 and left the hospital in 2024 just months before Mother's Day.

Just before the 2017 car crash Flewellen had just dropped her three sons off at school. The youngest son Julian was 11 at the time. Now that her son is 17 and her other sons have graduated from high school Flewellen is trying to make up for lost time this Mother’s Day.

Jennifer Flewellen and her family in October 2023. Peggy Means

Speaking with CBS News on May 10 Flewellen's mom Peggy Means opened up about how she never wanted to take her daughter off of life support — despite doctors telling her that “she's not gonna wake up.”

Asked whether she questioned her decision to keep Flewellen on life support Means told the outlet that even after her daughter had been in a coma for years she still never gave up hope that she could make a recovery. “Never” Means insisted.

Then in August 2022 Flewellen woke up from the coma.

In December 2023 Means and Flewellen's son Julian opened up to PEOPLE about the moment she woke up. Means was visiting her at the rehabilitation hospital speaking to her as usual when suddenly she realized Flewellen was laughing at a joke she had told.

""When she woke up it scared me at first because she was laughing and she had never done that"" Means told PEOPLE at the time. ""Every dream came true. Today's the day I said 'That door that was closed that kept us apart had just opened. We were back.' ""

“She woke up but she didn't completely. She couldn't speak but she was nodding” Means added. “She would still sleep a lot right at first but then as the months would go by she would get stronger and be more awake.”

Means took a video of Flewellen shortly after she woke up and sent the video to family and friends — including her youngest son Julian who went to see his mom the very next day.

“I told her I was Juju and her eyes lit up like 'Wow it's my Juju bean' "" Julian told PEOPLE referencing his mom's nickname for him. “But when she actually found out our ages and things like that it broke her heart. She started to cry.”



Although Flewellen went home about one year after waking up in the hospital she still has very limited speech and mobility and is using funds from a GoFundMe campaign to help her get access to a wheelchair accessible car and more.

Despite her struggles her mind is still getting sharper her family said.

In October 2023 Flewellen reached another big milestone in her recovery journey when she attended senior night football celebration at her son's high school.

“She was my biggest supporter” Julian told PEOPLE. “So to have my biggest supporter back on the sidelines cheering me on it was a surreal moment.""

Reflecting on her recovery journey thus far with CBS Flewellen had a simple yet powerful response to the question: ""What's the best part of being back among us?""

""Everything"" she answered.

Despite her still-limited speech the mom of three added that she was ready to celebrate Mother's Day with four simple words.

""I love my mom"" Flewellen said."

What is the Exchange in Detroit?

The Exchange in Detroit is a new 16-story residential high-rise building that might change how similar buildings are constructed. Relatively humble in its dimensions relative to other high-rises the building’s main claim to fame is the way it is built: from the top down rather than the more conventional ground-up.

The 207-foot-tall (63-meter-tall) Exchange skyscraper is one of the first such buildings in North America. The structure serves as a prototype for LIFTbuild technology which uses an apparatus that transforms a building site into a manufacturing facility.

The new system uses a patented method of vertical structure assembly. The entire roof and floor plate assembly are first completed at ground level. The outer facade and other chosen systems are put in place after the floor plates are put together.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmluZGlhLmNvbS9hc3NhbS9sYXlvZmZzMjAyMy1nb29nbGUtbWljcm9zb2Z0LW1ldGEtYW1hem9uLWF1dG9kZXNrLWxheW9mZi1jb250aW51ZS10aGlzLXNvZnR3YXJlLWNvbXBhbnktNTg4NDMxOS_SAYABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaW5kaWEuY29tL2Fzc2FtL2xheW9mZnMyMDIzLWdvb2dsZS1taWNyb3NvZnQtbWV0YS1hbWF6b24tYXV0b2Rlc2stbGF5b2ZmLWNvbnRpbnVlLXRoaXMtc29mdHdhcmUtY29tcGFueS01ODg0MzE5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Layoffs Continue!

Claire S. Published on February 5 2023 by

Hello and welcome to our top 5 3D printing videos of the week. We have an exciting selection of videos for you from Unlimited Tomorrow’s 3D printed prosthetic arms for Ukrainian war victims to McLaren’s use of additive manufacturing for Formula 1. There is also a more technical video from Autodesk about the new features of their modeling software Fusion 360. For the more business minded among you we have selected a discussion between representatives from Dassault Systemes and a technology advisory agency on the future of manufacturing and product design. Finally we have a video from the Louisiana Institute of Microtechnology about the application of additive manufacturing for the benefit of scientific research.

Top 1: Unlimited Tomorrow’s 3D Printed Prosthetic Arms

3D printing for most of us is business (or pleasure) but it is important to remember that for some people it means a lot more than that. We have previously written on the applications of 3D printing to make prosthetics allowing people to live fuller lives with improved mobility. Unlimited Tomorrow is using this idea to aid victims of the war in Ukraine offering 100 3D-printed prosthetic arms by taking 3D scans to create the cutting-edge devices. The firm is working with Siemens using their software solutions to take remote scans to allow them to begin work in Ukraine. They also benefited from Siemens’ knowledge of Ukrainian healthcare infrastructure to roll out the solution.

Top 2: McLaren And Formula One

Next up we have a video from McLaren sports car manufacturer known for their Formula 1 team. This video is 24 hours of work at the McLaren factory. The video features Andrea Stella F1 Team Principal who discusses the mindset behind motor racing manufacturing; we also see the teams who design and build the parts for the cars. The latter part of the video focuses on the additive manufacturing aspect of the work featuring Henry Jarret one of the technicians. He tells us about the importance of the technology for prototype parts. They use SLA printers to make these parts and we see the machines in action as part of the 24 hour shift.

Top 3: Fusion360’s New Features

For those keen on 3D printing from home who like to make their own files Fusion 360 is a well-known modeling software from Autodesk which allows you to do just that. You can find in this video a description of the new features including dropdown menus for ease of use and an improved geometry and stock contour selection with better visualization. The Fusion 360 has also been improved with the addition of

Top 4: The Evolution of Manufacturing

Dassault Systemes is a French software firm. In this video we hear from Stephane Sireau Vice-President of the High-Tech Systems at the firm in conversation with Paul Armstrong head of Here/Forth technology advisory company. First we get a run-down of each of their respective roles. They then discuss how changes to manufacturing and technology could transfer the business sphere from digital twins to AI to IoT. There is also talk of the lifecycle of products – a circular economy is becoming increasingly important for the consumer. Of course sustainability is a part of 3D printing: one benefit of the technology is the material savings and many firms are working with recycled or waste materials in order to decrease their environmental impact.

Top 5: Micromanufacturing With 3D Printing

Finally we have a video on the research and innovation side. This video features Dr. Arden Moore director of Louisiana Tech Institute for Micromanufacturing. He tells us about the use of additive manufacturing to progress scientific ideas. The Institute offers graduate students the opportunity to learn research capabilities 3D printing skills as well as communication. We also learn about two PhD project in particular using lasers and composite micro devices respectively. The team use additive manufacturing to produce these micro devices as well as prototypes for research.

Here's what to do if you're struggling with payments,"Fotostorm | E+ | Getty Images

For a rising share of car owners monthly auto loan payments appear to be evolving into a problem. While borrowers who are behind on their payments by more than 60 days represent a tiny portion of all outstanding auto loans — 1.84% — their ranks are growing according to a recent report from Cox Automotive. The share was 26.7% higher in December than the year-earlier month and is largely concentrated among borrowers with low credit scores. ""The danger of struggling to pay an auto loan is not just risking your car getting repossessed it's the long-term impact on all of the other areas of your finances"" said certified financial planner Angela Dorsey founder of Dorsey Wealth Management in Torrance California.

High prices interest rates have led to bigger payments

Loan delinquencies can harm your credit score

While the auto loan delinquency rate is edging higher the default rate is not according to Cox. Entering default — when your lender determines you are not going to pay usually some time after 90 days of no payments — can translate into your car being repossessed. Yet even being too late on one payment has a negative effect on your financial life and it can be long-lasting. ""If you're 30 days late it impacts your credit score"" said Brian Moody executive editor of Kelley Blue Book.

That's when lenders typically report the late payment to credit-reporting firms Equifax Experian and TransUnion . Also you should be aware that because your payment history is the most influential factor in your credit score — it typically accounts for 35% of it — you could see a drop of 100 points due to being 30 days late with a payment according to NerdWallet. The longer the loan goes unpaid the bigger the hit to your score and that delinquency can remain on your credit report for up to seven years. As consumers generally know the lower your score the more likely you are to pay higher interest rates on new loans or credit you get. Additionally a poor score or poor credit history may cause you to pay higher premiums on auto or homeowner's insurance and affect your ability to rent an apartment or even get a job. Employers can't see your score but they can check your report.

What to do if you're struggling with auto loan bills

For car owners who are pretty sure they're heading toward delinquency it's important to try preventing the problem from snowballing. ""If you sense this is coming be on top of it"" Moody said. ""Don't do nothing. It won't get better on its own."" If you're struggling to keep up because you don't budget well that's at least potentially fixable experts say. In that case take a hard look at how you're spending money.

""Take a look at your overall expenses for the last few months"" said Joe Pendergast vice president of consumer lending for Navy Federal Credit Union. ""You would be amazed how much the average person spends each month without realizing it."" However if the payments are simply not manageable the first thing you should do is bring your lender into the loop. ""If a consumer is struggling to make their car payments or anticipates challenges ahead they should reach out to their financial institution as soon as possible"" Pendergast said.

The sooner your bank or credit union is made aware the easier it is to come up with possible solutions. Joe Pendergast Vice president of consumer lending for Navy Federal Credit Union

""The sooner your bank or credit union is made aware the easier it is to come up with possible solutions"" he said. While the options vary from lender to lender you may be able to get a deferment — i.e. a few months without a payment — or a new loan that lowers the payments by stretching out the length. Either way be aware that this generally would lead to paying more in interest noted Moody of Kelley Blue Book. However a deferment would at least give you time to figure out how to best manage your situation he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMy0yOTA5Ny040gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Incentive strategy of safe and intelligent production in assembled steel plants from the perspective of evolutionary ...,"Strategic stability analysis of the government

According to the stability theorem of differential equation the stable state of the probability that the government selects the incentive must satisfy F(q) = 0 and F′(q) < 0. The derivative of the government's replication dynamic Eq. (7) can be obtained:

$$F^{\prime}\left( q \right) = \left( {1 - 2q} \right){\mkern 1mu} \left\{ {\left( {1 - {\mkern 1mu} \theta_{2} } \right)S_{1} + \theta_{2} {\mkern 1mu} w + p\left[ {\left( {S_{1} {\mkern 1mu} - w} \right)\left( {\theta_{2} - {\mkern 1mu} \theta_{1} } \right) - G} \right]} \right\}$$ (9)

When \(p = p^{*} = \frac{{\left( {1 - {\mkern 1mu} \theta_{2} } \right)S_{1} + \theta_{2} {\mkern 1mu} w}}{{G + \left( {S_{1} {\mkern 1mu} - w} \right)\left( {{\mkern 1mu} \theta_{1} - \theta_{2} } \right)}}\) F(q) ≡ 0 and F’(q) ≡ 0 can be obtained. At this time any strategy formulated by the government is stable.

If \(\left( {S_{1} {\mkern 1mu} - w} \right)\left( {\theta_{2} - {\mkern 1mu} \theta_{1} } \right) - G > 0\) when p > p* \(\left. {F^{\prime}\left( q \right)} \right|_{q = 0} > 0\) \(\left. {F^{\prime}\left( q \right)} \right|_{q = 1} < 0\) q = 1 is in an evolutionary stable state the government's strategy is incentive. When p < p* \(\left. {F^{\prime}\left( q \right)} \right|_{q = 0} < 0\) \(\left. {F^{\prime}\left( q \right)} \right|_{q = 1} > 0\) q = 0 is in an evolutionary stable state the government's strategy is no incentive.

If \(\left( {S_{1} {\mkern 1mu} - w} \right)\left( {\theta_{2} - {\mkern 1mu} \theta_{1} } \right) - G < 0\) when p > p* \(\left. {F^{\prime}\left( q \right)} \right|_{q = 0} < 0\) \(\left. {F^{\prime}\left( q \right)} \right|_{q = 1} > 0\) q = 0 is in an evolutionary stable state the government's strategy is no incentive. When p < p* \(\left. {F^{\prime}\left( q \right)} \right|_{q = 0} > 0\) \(\left. {F^{\prime}\left( q \right)} \right|_{q = 1} < 0\) q = 1 is in an evolutionary stable state the government's strategy is incentive.

Strategic stability analysis of assembled steel plants

The steady state for the selection of smart production in an assembled steel plant needs to satisfy F(p) = 0 and F′(p) < 0. The derivative of the replication dynamic Eq. (8) can be obtained:

$$F^{\prime}\left( p \right) = {\mkern 1mu} \left( {1 - 2p} \right)\left\{ {C_{2} - C_{1} + R_{1} - R_{2} + {\text{D}}\left( {\theta_{2} - {\mkern 1mu} \theta_{1} } \right) + {\mkern 1mu} q\left[ {G + w\left( {\theta_{2} - {\mkern 1mu} \theta_{1} } \right)} \right]} \right\}$$ (10)

When \(q = q^{*} = \frac{{R_{2} - R_{1} + C_{1} - C_{2} + {\text{D}}\left( {{\mkern 1mu} \theta_{1} - {\mkern 1mu} \theta_{2} } \right)}}{{G + w\left( {\theta_{2} {\mkern 1mu} - \theta_{1} {\mkern 1mu} } \right)}}\) F(p) ≡ 0 and F′(p) ≡ 0 can be obtained. At this time any strategy formulated by the government is stable.

According to the parameter relationship it is known that \(G + w\left( {\theta_{2} - {\mkern 1mu} \theta_{1} } \right) > 0\) if q > q* then \(\left. {F^{\prime}\left( p \right)} \right|_{p = 0} > 0\) \(\left. {F^{\prime}\left( p \right)} \right|_{p = 1} < 0\) at this time p = 1 is in an evolutionary stable state and the strategy of the assembled steel plant is to choose the smart plant strategy. If q < q* then \(\left. {F^{\prime}\left( p \right)} \right|_{p = 0} < 0\) \(\left. {F^{\prime}\left( p \right)} \right|_{p = 1} > 0\) at this time p = 0 is in an evolutionary stable state and the strategy of the assembled steel plant is to choose the traditional plant strategy.

$$\left\{ \begin{gathered} F\left( q \right) = q{\mkern 1mu} \left( {1 - q} \right){\mkern 1mu} \left\{ {\left( {1 - {\mkern 1mu} \theta_{2} } \right)S_{1} + \theta_{2} {\mkern 1mu} w + p\left[ {\left( {S_{1} {\mkern 1mu} - w} \right)\left( {\theta_{2} - {\mkern 1mu} \theta_{1} } \right) - G} \right]} \right\} = 0 \\ F\left( p \right) = p{\mkern 1mu} \left( {1 - p} \right)\left\{ {C_{2} - C_{1} + R_{1} - R_{2} + {\text{D}}\left( {\theta_{2} - {\mkern 1mu} \theta_{1} } \right) + {\mkern 1mu} q\left[ {G + w\left( {\theta_{2} - {\mkern 1mu} \theta_{1} } \right)} \right]} \right\} = 0 \\ \end{gathered} \right.$$ (11)

Five equilibrium points can be obtained by solving equation system (11): E 1 (00) E 2 (01) E 3 (10) E 4 (11) E 5 (q* p*) where \(p^{*} = \frac{{\left( {1 - {\mkern 1mu} \theta_{2} } \right)S_{1} + \theta_{2} {\mkern 1mu} w}}{{G + \left( {S_{1} {\mkern 1mu} - w} \right)\left( {{\mkern 1mu} \theta_{1} - \theta_{2} } \right)}}\) \(q^{*} = \frac{{R_{2} - R_{1} + C_{1} - C_{2} + {\text{D}}\left( {{\mkern 1mu} \theta_{1} - {\mkern 1mu} \theta_{2} } \right)}}{{G + w\left( {\theta_{2} {\mkern 1mu} - \theta_{1} {\mkern 1mu} } \right)}}\). According to Friedman's study42 the stability of the evolutionary system can be obtained from the local stability analysis of the Jacobian matrix. The Jacobian matrix of the two-dimensional system is as follows:

$$J = \left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {\frac{\partial F\left( q \right)}{{\partial q}}} & {\frac{\partial F\left( q \right)}{{\partial p}}} \\ {\frac{\partial F\left( p \right)}{{\partial q}}} & {\frac{\partial F\left( p \right)}{{\partial p}}} \\ \end{array} } \right] = \left[ {\begin{array}{*{20}c} {a_{11} } & {a_{12} } \\ {a_{21} } & {a_{22} } \\ \end{array} } \right]$$ (12)

Among them:

$$\left\{ \begin{gathered} a_{11} = \left( {1 - 2\q} \right)\\left\{ {\left( {1 - \\theta_{2} } \right)S_{1} + \theta_{2} \w - p\left[ {G + \left( {S_{1} - w} \right)\left( {\theta_{1} - \theta_{2} } \right)} \right]} \right\} \hfill \\ a_{12} = - q{\mkern 1mu} \left( {1 - q} \right){\mkern 1mu} \left[ {G + \left( {S_{1} - w} \right){\mkern 1mu} \left( {\theta_{1} - {\mkern 1mu} \theta_{2} } \right)} \right] \hfill \\ a_{21} = p{\mkern 1mu} \left( {1 - p} \right){\mkern 1mu} \left[ {G - w\left( {\theta_{1} {\mkern 1mu} - \theta_{2} {\mkern 1mu} } \right)} \right] \hfill \\ a_{22} = \left( {1 - 2\p} \right)\\left\{ {R_{1} - R_{2} + C_{2} - C_{1} - {\text{D}}\left( {\\theta_{1} - \\theta_{2} } \right) + q\left[ {G\ - w\left( {\\theta_{1} \ - \\theta_{2} \} \right)} \right]} \right\} \hfill \\ \end{gathered} \right.$$ (13)

According to Lyapunov stability theory a sufficient necessary condition for the game system to achieve ESS is that all eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix have negative real parts. That is the system stable state in the Jacobian matrix should satisfy the determinant \(detJ = \lambda_{1} \lambda_{2} > 0\) and trace \(trJ = \lambda_{1} + \lambda_{2} < 0\) (λ 1 and λ 2 are the two eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix). Because of the instability of the mixed strategy point in the evolution process—the trace \(trJ = 0\) of (q* p*) only the local stability of the remaining four equilibrium points as pure strategy points in the Jacobian matrix is considered. By substituting the equilibrium point into the Jacobian matrix the eigenvalue of each equilibrium point can be obtained and summarized in Table 3.

In order to facilitate the subsequent analysis the equation is simplified in this paper

$$\left\{ \begin{gathered} K = \left( {1 - \theta_{2} } \right)S_{1} + \theta_{2} w \hfill \\ L = \left( {1 - \theta_{1} } \right)S_{1} - G + \theta_{1} w \hfill \\ M = R_{1} - R_{2} - C_{1} + C_{2} + D\left( {\theta_{2} - \theta_{1} } \right) \hfill \\ N = R_{1} - R_{2} - C_{1} + C_{2} + G + \left( {D + w} \right)\left( {\theta_{2} - \theta_{1} } \right) \hfill \\ \end{gathered} \right.$$ (14)

Since \(\left( {1 - \theta_{2} } \right)S_{1} - \theta_{2} S_{2} + \theta_{2} w > - \theta_{2} S_{2}\) which is K > 0 it can be judged that E 1 (00) must not be a stable point of the evolution system. Based on the four situations shown in Table 3 there are three parameter relationships satisfying \(detJ > 0\) and \(trJ < 0\).

Condition I: When N < 0 it is known that M < 0. Both sides of the game evolve to (10) under this condition that is the government chooses the incentive strategy and the assembled steel plant chooses the traditional plant strategy.

Condition II: When L < 0 M > 0 N > 0 (01) is the only stable point of the system. At this time the government chooses the no incentive strategy and the assembled steel plants choose the smart plant strategy.

Condition III: When L > 0 N > 0 (11) is the only stable point of the system. Under this condition the government chooses the incentive strategy and the assembled steel plants chooses the smart plant strategy.

Specifically the stability analysis results corresponding to the three parameter relationships are shown in Table 4.

Table 4 Stability analysis under different conditions. Full size table

Based on the above stabilization strategies and conditions the following conclusions can be drawn:

①The government's subsidy policy is an important initiative to promote the manufacturing industry to achieve intelligent transformation and help traditional factories to move towards smart production. ②Regardless of whether or not the government sets up incentive strategies plants will participate in smart production as long as the net benefits derived by assembled steel plants choosing smart plants are greater than those generated by the traditional model. In short investors seek advantage and avoid disadvantage. Therefore for the government reasonable subsidy incentives can satisfy the revenue needs of assembled steel plants and help stimulate investors' participation. In addition the setting of negative penalty mechanism is conducive to enhancing the safety awareness of steel plants thus eliminating opportunistic behavior in the cooperation process.

Numerical case study

Numerical simulation is helpful to directly reflect the results of theoretical research and can continuously and dynamically show the development rule of things. Therefore numerical simulation is often used as a supplementary argument to game analysis. In order to test the effectiveness of the theoretical game model this part is based on MATLAB to carry out numerical simulation analysis of the Fuzhou X Steel Structure Plant project. The first part of this section describes the case background of the Fuzhou X Steel Structure Plant project and sets the parameters corresponding to the model. The second part obtains the dynamic evolution process of the decision-making behavior of each stakeholder in the initial state of the project through MATLAB simulation. The third part carries out numerical simulation on the sensitivity of the relevant parameter changes (including costs subsidies etc.) of the project participants in the initial state to provide case reference for the government to actively promote the intelligent transformation of the manufacturing industry and enhance the internal upgrading power of enterprises.

Case background and parameter value setting

According to the policy of Fuzhou assembled construction bidding requires one bid and one component plant. Therefore the steel plant will seize the opportunity of the policy dividend ""window"". With the first-mover advantage of the steel structure production base and the ""EPC + industrialization"" bidding policy Company X has vigorously expanded the steel structure assembly EPC business and realized the accelerated growth of the marketing contract amount.

The X Steel Structure Plant project is located in the suburb of Fuzhou City Fujian Province about 45 km away from the urban area of Fuzhou. The transportation is convenient and the plant can be reached through the highway G70 or the national highway G316. The project covers Putian Ningde Nanping Sanming Quanzhou Pingtan Comprehensive Experimental Zone and other central cities in Fujian Province. The project covers a land area of about 88 mu and two steel structure production lines (heavy steel line and light steel line) are operated at the same time with an annual capacity of 25000 tons. The total project investment is about 49956700 yuan with payback period of 7.38 years (including 1-year construction period) and internal rate of return of 11.52%. The capital contribution of Company X is in the form of fixed assets such as land after evaluation and Company Y is in cash. After the project is put into operation both parties will share the dividends according to their respective equity ratios. In order to lead the development of the steel structure green ecological industry in Haixi region the project is positioned as an industrial base of steel structure assembled building integrating research and development design production manufacturing sales and construction. The GS-Building and ME-House assembled steel structure building product systems with independent intellectual property rights of Y Company are introduced forming a complete integrated solution. Through the project feasibility study report and relevant policy data this paper makes theoretical assignments to the relevant parameters which are detailed in Table 5.

Table 5 Initial parameter values of the evolutionary game model. Full size table

Stakeholder dynamic evolution

According to the initial parameter value setting of the evolutionary game model in Table 5 the parameters of the project are obtained to satisfy \(\left( {1 - \theta_{1} } \right)S_{1} - G + \theta_{1} w < 0\) \(R_{1} - R_{2} - C_{1} + C_{2} + G + \left( {D + w} \right)\left( {\theta_{2} - \theta_{1} } \right) < 0\). Based on MATLAB R2021a 81 different groups of (qp) initial strategy points can be randomly generated to test the stability of the equilibrium point E 4 (11) in the game process. The lines with different colors in Fig. 1 represent the evolution process of 81 groups of different initial strategic points randomly produced by MATLAB in the game between the two sides. As shown in Fig. 3 as the evolution time grows after continuous iteration the strategies of both parties will converge to (11). At this time the ESS of the government and assembled steel plants is {incentive assembled steel smart plant}. The simulation process illustrates that the initial strategy choosing states of both sides of the game do not affect the evolutionary outcome when the constraints are satisfied. With sufficient evolutionary time the final behavioral strategies of each stakeholder will gradually evolve into optimal solutions. Thus the theoretical analysis in the previous section is effectively tested while providing a basis for the initial state setting of the subsequent sensitivity analysis.

Parameter sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analysis as a quantitative analysis method aims to observe the change of the target through the adjustment of factors so as to find out the rules. Based on the parameter setting of the case the initial strategy of both sides of the game can be set as (q 0  p 0 ) = (0.5 0.5). This part will simulate and analyze the relevant influencing factors in turn.

Firstly numerical simulation is carried out for the policy subsidy limit G the penalty limit w for safety accidents and the improvement of government credibility S 1 .

Subsidy G under the government incentive strategy is set as 5 10 and 15 respectively. Based on the two-dimensional dynamical system the results are shown in Fig. 4. The government's punishment w for safety accidents is set at 10 30 60 and the simulation results under the two-dimensional system are shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 4 it is shown that when G = 15 p evolves fastest toward 1 while q evolves slowest toward 1. This suggests that a reasonable subsidy setup can to some extent facilitate a win–win situation—satisfying both the revenue needs of the assembled steel plant as an investor and the government's smooth promotion of smart manufacturing initiatives. In addition Fig. 4 also shows that excessive subsidies can cause financial burden on government departments which leads to the tendency of disincentive. From Fig. 5 it is clear that increased government punishment for safety accidents will enhance the speed of evolution to the stability point for both sides of the game. Strict punishment mechanism is the key to promote the healthy development of smart manufacturing.

Then in order to analyze the impact of the improvement of government credibility on the evolution process and results this paper will assign values of 20 10 and 2 respectively. The simulation results of replication dynamic equations evolving over time are shown in Fig. 6. At this point S 1 in the steady state should satisfy \(S_{1} > \frac{{G - \theta_{1} w}}{{1 - \theta_{1} }}\) that is when ESS is (11) S 1 > 4.44 (4.44 is the critical value meeting the stability conditions of (11) which is calculated based on the above Eq. (14) and Table 5 parameters. At this critical value the government behaves as a horizontal line and is in a mixed strategy state. However the change of initial value can break this state and make it evolve to pure strategy.). From Fig. 6 it can be seen that as S 1 decreases the probability of government incentives becomes lower. When S 1 < 4.44 the evolutionary stable state of both sides of the game will become (01). As can be seen when the project background changes the evolutionary stability state of both sides of the game changes accordingly. Therefore the government's incentive strategy should also be flexible to adjust with changes in project benefits costs safety governance capacity and other conditions.

In order to explore the evolution of the behavioral decisions of the game subjects in the smart production model this section conducts numerical simulations of the project's cost C 1  benefit R 1  the probability of a safety accident in the smart plant θ 1 and the accident loss D.

Assign the values of C 1 as C 1 = 2030.4511 2050.9607 2132.9991 and the results are shown in Fig. 7. Assign the values of R 1 as R 1 = 2179.304 2135.718 2070.339 and the results are shown in Fig. 8. From Fig. 7 it can be seen that with the increase of the cost of assembled steel smart plant q will evolve in the direction of 1 while p will evolve in the direction of 0. At this time the critical value condition of C 1 is \(C_{1} = R_{1} - R_{2} + C_{2} + G + \left( {D + w} \right)\left( {\theta_{2} - \theta_{1} } \right)\) that is C 1 = 2193.46. This system stability state changes from (11) to (10) when the parameter change is greater than 2193.46. Figure 8 shows that the considerable benefits of the assembled steel smart plant project are the key to attracting assembled steel manufacturers to invest in it. Based on this condition R 1 satisfies \(R_{1} > C_{1} + R_{2} - C_{2} - G - \left( {D + w} \right)\left( {\theta_{2} - \theta_{1} } \right)\) i.e. the critical value of R 1 is 2136.8. When R 1 changes less than 2136.8 the system steady state (11) will change to (10).

Next the accident probability and the amount of loss generated by the accident are analyzed. Set θ 1 = 0.1 0.25 0.5 and the simulation results of replication dynamic equations evolution over time as shown in Fig. 9. Set D = 20 60 100 and the simulation results of replication dynamic equations evolution over time as shown in Fig. 10. Figure 9 shows that with the increase of θ 1  the mood of the government to set incentives becomes stronger and the assembled steel plant will prefer the traditional production mode. When \(\theta_{1} > \frac{{R_{1} - R_{2} - C_{1} + C_{2} + G}}{D + w} + \theta_{2}\) i.e. θ 1 > 0.45419 the assembled steel plant will change the original strategy. Figure 10 shows that as the loss amount D increases the assembled steel plant prefers to choose the smart production option.

You may have come across hundreds of modified cars but this Maruti Suzuki Ciaz hits the right spot with its vibrant appeal and praise-worthy dynamics. This example looks nothing less than a hot wheels collection car with modifications far beyond imagination.

The inspiration comes from a drag racer as the extra-wide tyres with chrome-finish rims can turn you speechless and it is the best-ever combination on an already sporty sedan. The front end of this typical Maruti Suzuki Ciaz has been modified to create a sharper effect leaving no stone unturned through a gloss black splitter an all-black centre grille and an extended bumper to bring a perfect mount for the custom-designed fender.

The headlights are smoked carrying dual projector bulbs and LED Daytime Running Lights (DRLs). 360 Motoring (Kollam) has used perfect spots for an all-black finish such as the roof fog light casing spoiler and rear splitter which further helps the vibrant yellow shade feel alive.

The rear section flaunts a quad exhaust system an NFS-inspired spoiler and smoked taillights. The rear fender area has been modified to achieve a handful of added thickness for the custom alloy wheels. A modified version of a Maruti Suzuki Ciaz is not a common sighting as most buyers prefer this car for its value-for-money approach among the C-segment sedan options.

The engine modifications if made to this specific Maruti Suzuki Ciaz have not been revealed by 360 Motoring (Kollam). Currently the stock version of the car is available with a single petrol engine option with the price range starting at INR 9.00 lakhs for the base model while it goes all the way up to INR 11.98 lakhs for the top model with an automatic transmission. The prices mentioned here are ex-showroom Delhi.

Have you ever had the burning desire to drink a lava lamp? In the late '90s The Clearly Canadian Beverage Corporation made a bet that this was a secret hankering that all soda drinkers had. And with that wild hypothesis the soda drink nobody on the planet asked for refreshing and chewy Orbitz was born.

Launched in 1996 Fast Company reports that the Orbitz soft drink was advertised as a ""texturally enhanced alternative beverage."" True to its word the soft drink contained magical little flavor balls that were chewy and gravity-defying. No matter how hard you shook your bottle of Orbitz those bouncy and edible orbs remained stubbornly suspended.

The Orbitz soda not only ignored the rules of gravity but it also seemed to eschew the rules of good taste. Fast Company describes reviews of the product as less than glowing. With a taste compared to cough syrup Pine-Sol and ""old water from a flower vase"" the actual flavors Orbitz was going for can be considered convoluted at best. Pineapple Banana Cherry Coconut? It confuses the brain and the tongue.

Still the visual appeal of the drink captured the imagination and curiosity of the masses. The company behind Orbitz offered a pat explanation for the beads' mysterious suspension: there is an equal amount of density between the spheres and the liquid (via Science Journal). But that raises another question. What were those free-floating balls made of?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1wYWNvcm4uY29tL2FydGljbGVzL2J1c2luZXNzLXBsYW5zLXN0cmlrZS1yaWdodC13aXRoLXBsYW5uaW5nLWNvbW1pc3Npb24v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Business plans strike right with planning commission,"The pins are starting to align for Bowlero Corp. a bowling center operator looking to move into the Moorpark market. The Virginia based company has cleared another hurdle in its quest to open the city’s first bowling alley.

Bowlero which hopes to open a 40-lane bowling alley with an attached restaurant at 706 Los Angeles Ave. in a space previously occupied by Dick’s Sporting Goods received permission from the city’s planning commission to expand business hours to 2 a.m. The 5-0 vote included allowing Bowlero to sell alcohol until 1:30 a.m.

While discussing the new facility company representatives said it will have more than 60 arcade games and a staff of 80 employees. They also said people up and down the state from Sacramento to San Bernardino appear to be loving the company’s bowling/arcade/ restaurant combination. The company operates bowling alleys in other states as well.

“(Bowlero) really grew here in California” said Andres Restrepo the company’s vice president of concept development. “And California seems to love bowling.”

Once it opens in Moorpark the company plans to offer packages for private events including bowling camps for local schools or Boy and Girl Scout troops. Restrepo said the company is also open to hosting bowling leagues if there is a desire for it.

Bowlero Oxnard opened last year and has been a tremendous success with the community company representatives told the commission.

“So that’s why Moorpark. We think we will be a great addition to the community” Restrepo said in response to a question from commissioner Jeff Brodsly about why the company wanted to expand into Moorpark.

Though none of the planning commissioners took issue with extending the hours some community members shared their concerns regarding noise possibly affecting the homes on the hills above the proposed bowling alley.

“I am in opposition to extending hours during which alcohol can be sold” wrote resident Alice Landavazo. “The building is located in close proximity to a residential neighborhood. My home is directly above this building and I am concerned about possible noise related to drinking activities during the latenight hours interfering with my family’s and neighbors’ ability to sleep at night.”

Commissioner Mark DiCecco said he had reached out to another business close to the Bowlero in Oxnard to ask about conditions.

“From facility managers to police everybody I spoke with had nothing but good things to say” he said. “If it brings more business to Moorpark I don’t have an issue with extending the hours.”

Brodsly said he’s been to two Bowlero locations and is looking forward to the project. While he said people may worry about noise he doesn’t believe that Moorpark is a “party city” that would create excessive racket.

“At least I hope not. . . . I personally think it’s great for the community” Brodsly said. “It gives us something to do it gives our children something to do and fits the vibe of what Moorpark is evolving into.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vcGlkZ2luL2FydGljbGVzL2N3NDM5cndyZ3h2b9IBNGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vcGlkZ2luL2FydGljbGVzL2N3NDM5cndyZ3h2by5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Juliette Lamour: Canada teenager win $48m lotto jackpot for her first try,"Canada teenager win $48m lotto jackpot for her first try

Morgan DBS CaixaBank and others are experimenting in the not-yet-realized metaverse to be ready to tap its opportunities when it arrives.





You would never walk into a bank branch with wild animals strolling around. J.P. Morgan opened the Onyx Lounge in Decentraland’s Metajuku mall though; in this branch there’s a portrait of Jamie Dimon on the wall—and a virtual tiger pacing the lobby.

Of course the Onyx Lounge isn’t a real place—it’s a virtual space in the immersive 3-D virtual world (or game) known as Decentraland where users interact (via avatars) in real time. Based on the Ethereum blockchain Decentraland which is partly user controlled launched in 2017 and sported a market cap of around $1.3 billion in late January according to CoinMarketCap.

Why did the bank create this experience? Decentraland is a precursor of the much anticipated metaverse which J.P. Morgan predicts will be a $1 trillion market opportunity.

What is the metaverse? “It’s an umbrella term to designate how we will experience the internet in the future” says David Kadio-Morokro EY Americas financial services innovation leader. “It’s not a place—it’s more a moment in the future where we will experience the internet and the digital world differently.”

In the metaverse people can collaborate and feel connected no matter where they are in the physical world. People often interact through avatars—animated images that act as their representatives—that walk around and interact with people and items in the metaverse.

To be fully realized the metaverse will have to leverage a host of innovations (some yet-to-be realized) including decentralized web applications with which users control their data and identity spatial computing that recreates physical worlds in digital ones and digital twins that mimic online the actions of human users in remote locations (you raise your hand; your digital twin raises its hand). But some of the necessary technologies aren’t ready yet and the processing power necessary is enormous.

Birthing Pangs

The metaverse isn’t yet built; it is being built right now with a lot of experimentation and rival platforms vying to establish dominance. Banks are similarly exploring this new arena—not alone but in strategic partnerships and joint ventures with tech firms—to understand the possible use cases and help evolve the platforms into true vehicles of economic opportunity.

“Some banks and financial institutions are using their outposts to educate their customers on financial literacy and their products build that knowledge and start preparing them for that world of hybrid digital-physical that is coming” says Kadio-Morokro.





For the time being banks are focused more on customer engagement. DBS has been active in looking to leverage the metaverse to build community and promote sustainability explains Lam Chee Kin group head of legal and compliance at DBS. In 2021 the bank launched LiveBetter a platform that encourages customers to embrace a more sustainable lifestyle.

Then last year DBS launched DBS BetterWorld which also promotes environmental social and governance (ESG) efforts on the Sandbox. The Sandbox a subsidiary of Animoca Brands is a decentralized virtual world in which brands and users purchase plots of “land” to build a unique experience. DBS acquired a 3×3 “plot” (nine virtual units) of land on which it’s developing an interactive experience to promote a more sustainable world. DBS plans to collaborate with the government communities businesses and tech.

The bank is looking to use the metaverse to promote its ESG agenda across banking and business practices with its effort to provide access to ESG investments and help customers live more sustainably. DBS BetterWorld is the bank’s platform to advance these causes with Sandbox visitors who can learn about these ESG concerns particularly regarding business. In addition the bank uses this platform to profile social entrepreneurs and their innovative business models.

“The idea of replicated real or purely fictional experiences in a virtual or augmented reality setting has many potential use cases when applied to the way that humanity can live play and work” says Chee Kin. “So it’s not just about games or something only the young will connect with.”

Placing the Right Bet

How to participate in the metaverse and which technology to use is a strategic decision for every bank that wishes to do so. Some banks focus on content that will serve to engage and entertain users. CaixaBank’s digital services and lifestyle platform imagin announced the launch of imaginLAND “its space in the metaverse” last April.

Mariona Vicens head of digital transformation and advanced analytics at CaixaBank says imagin plans to hold monthly events in imaginLAND focusing on culture creativity technology and sustainability.

These events have included a concert performed last April in Barcelona by the Spanish musical group Marlon. A 360-degree recording is shown on Decentraland at imaginCafé in Forrest Plaza plot 8.68. Users can watch the concert from various vantage points that are not always accessible in real life: from the audience backstage and onstage. In addition over the holiday season the bank held virtual festive activities for children in the metaverse.

“Having a space on Decentraland is the best way to learn about this new environment and these new relationship channels” says David Urbano chief marketing officer at imagin. “By having our own space imaginLAND we can obtain information on how many users access it how frequently how they use it—and above all find out if they need something special from us.”

BPI CaixaBank’s Portuguese subsidiary opened the group’s first virtual reality (VR) bank branch where customers can walk through the two-floor branch and learn about BPI’s offerings using simulators for savings products mortgages and personal loans. They can also play virtual miniature golf.

Bank of America’s (BofA’s) approach is to study internally how the metaverse works testing its associates’ responses before exploring external use cases.

“The whole point from a metaverse perspective is to create that level of presence and collaboration” says Mike Wynn Bank of America Academy Innovation and Design Executive.

BofA is piloting an internal metaverse experience where people work together to solve a particular problem or puzzle. These experiences currently use VR technology and aim to replicate classroom training for team building for example since talking about team building doesn’t always translate to better teams.

One pilot transports several people to another planet where they appear as robots. Everyone has a different role and the group must work together to accomplish a task within a specified period—in this scenario each robot has to escape the planet in its own pod or the mission fails.

A facilitator provides basic instructions at the beginning and throughout the experience. Then teams are given three opportunities to escape the planet—often groups don’t start operating as a team until the third round.

“This is where the metaverse shines—it can help teach people the importance of communication and teamwork” says Wynn. While a classroom might spark an interesting discussion it’s only when people are in certain situations that behaviors emerge that help them understand how they operate in a team and whether they’re effective as team members.

BofA is also looking to use this technology for internal and external job candidates. Metaverse technology can allow candidates to experience a day in the life of a particular position to ascertain whether the position is a good fit. At a physical career fair by providing VR headsets to potential candidates those people can interact with hiring managers in different locations across the US.

“The metaverse is in its infancy and there’s a lot that still needs to be figured out and ultimately developed” says Wynn. “With some of the use cases that we’re looking at we’re learning what this [technology] can do and what people feel comfortable doing. So far we love what we’re seeing; but there’s a lot more to learn.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzQ1NjJjM2UzLTMzM2UtNGZmMi05MDg2LTM4NDJhYjRkZjMwZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Goldman can regain its swagger,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzQ1NjJjM2UzLTMzM2UtNGZmMi05MDg2LTM4NDJhYjRkZjMwZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002562813A020>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The new apartment complex called The Uptown features 60 mostly one-bedroom apartments for tenants aged 55 and older. The apartments are for mixed-income households with rents ranging between $794 and $1495 per month. Around 42 apartments are classified as low-income according to developer The Szanton Company.

A large crowd gathered for the grand opening of the redeveloped Moses and Columbia Block Buildings on the corner of Front and Summer streets on May 8.

“There’s a housing shortage here and everywhere in Maine so the fact that we have one unit still available before we even open our doors speaks to the need for housing” said The Szanton Company Vice President Amy Cullen.

Around 10 existing units were already open in the Moses and Columbia building with Szanton adding four more units there Cullen said.

Applications for The Uptown opened in January with the apartments filling up in about one month leaving just one unit available at the time of the grand opening. The new tenants started moving into The Uptown on May 10.

“There is a housing crisis in the state and Bath is no exception” said Bath City Council Chairperson Mary Ellen Bell. “The Uptown project builds density in the downtown recreates underutilized space and provides attainable housing for some of our older residents.”

The newest addition of the building that connects to the renovated Columbia and Moses housing block sits on what used to be an empty lot that was once home to the Bath YMCA. Szanton bought the historic Moses and Columbia blocks back in 2020 with construction beginning in the summer of 2022 according to Cullen.

“The rehab of the existing historic building Moses and Columbia block that this project contains had a lot more work than we expected” Cullen said.

Most of the new tenants come from the Bath area with some coming in from out of state.

“For years to come these affordable homes are going to be a remarkable and lasting tribute to those who have worked so hard for affordable housing in this City of Ships” said MaineHousing Director Daniel Brennan.

and live on Freeview channel 276 Visit Shots! now

Phil Dowson says Saints will travel to Bath on Saturday 'fully loaded from an intent and physicality point of view'.

The black green and gold have already secured a home play-off semi-final in the Gallagher Premiership after cruising to a 90-0 win against Gloucester last Saturday.

That means Saints could take the chance to rest players against Bath but Dowson was giving little away in terms of his team selection when asked after the Gloucester game.

He did however insist they will not be taking the trip to The Rec lightly.

""It (team selection) is not something I've considered hugely"" the Saints boss said.

""Bath are obviously a very good side particularly at home and we've got to try to maintain the momentum and keep pushing our performance.

""We've only talked this season about our performance and not necessarily the results so we'll keep pushing for those sorts of things.

""We go to The Rec fully loaded from an intent point of view and from a physicality point of view and see where we end up.""

Saints may have secured a top-two spot but Dowson added: ""They don't hand out any medals or trophies for that so we make sure we acknowledge that and make sure it drives our energy moving forward.""

Saints had suffered back-to-back defeats prior to last weekend as they lost to Harlequins and Leinster.

And Dowson was delighted with the way his side bounced back as they continued a strong season in style with the 14-try demolition of Gloucester.

""I don't need to wait for a 90-0 game to be proud of them.

ChatGPT the new buzzy chatbot developed by artificial intelligence company OpenAI is the world's latest obsession for its human-like responses.

The bot which bagged a $10 billion investment from Microsoft has shown a capacity for a range of tasks such as writing stock stories layoff emails and even dating-app messages. The craze around it has even boosted investor appetite for AI stocks sending shares in names like Nvidia and Ambarella soaring.

Earlier this week I put the human mimic-like tool to the test to see what all the fuss was about. I enjoyed its conversational tone and was grabbed by the ease at which it churned out content but its lack of empathy or decision-making skills ultimately made it easy for me to remember it's just a robot.

As a frequent writer on the US equities market I sought out to ask the AI tool what character traits make for a good stock investor. Here's what it chucked at me.

ChatGPT's 6-part tip on traits that make for a successful stock investor

Patience: Investing in the stock market often requires a long-term perspective and the ability to withstand short-term volatility. Discipline: Developing and sticking to a well-thought-out investment strategy can help investors avoid impulsive decisions based on emotions. Objectivity: Being able to separate personal opinions and emotions from investment decisions can lead to more rational and informed investment choices. Perseverance: Investing in the stock market can be a challenging and sometimes frustrating experience but having the determination to stay the course and stick to a strategy can lead to long-term success. Open-mindedness: Keeping an open mind to new information and being willing to adjust your investment strategy in light of new developments can help you stay ahead of the curve. Attention to detail: Careful research and attention to detail can help investors identify the best investment opportunities and avoid costly mistakes.

ChatGPT then cautioned none of its advice can guarantee success. ""Having these traits does not guarantee success in the stock market but they can help investors make better decisions and navigate the ups and downs of the market more effectively"" it said.

The bot's tips impressed me given it mirrored the advice of top investors like Warren Buffet and ""Big Short"" fund manager Michael Burry. Like ChatGPT Buffett says self-discipline and keeping emotions in check is key for investors.

The Berkshire Hathaway CEO – often considered a role model in the investing world – has also showcased the virtues highlighted by ChatGPT according to the ""Richer Wiser Happier"" author William Green. Green noted that Buffett's phenomenal success was steeped in qualities like patience and having an open mind.

He gave the example of Buffett who for decades brushed off technology as outside of his circle of competence then injected $36 billion into Apple between 2016 and 2018. Its stake has blown up in value to about $134 billion today.

Meanwhile Gabriel Colominas a buy-side equity analyst at Gesiuris Asset Management and a Burry expert has said the investor showcased virtues like perseverance through his ability to withstand pressure and possess the deep conviction needed to stay the course.

He used the example of Burry's iconic bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble which was mocked by Wall Street only for the legendary investor to be proven right.

However chatGPT didn't have all the answers. For instance the bot failed to identify other key traits underpinning Buffett's success like dedication humility and simplicity.

David Shayer CEO of Vantage Markets UK told Insider that while ChatGPT picks up on specific personality traits of successful investors it misses others.

""I think there are some characteristics missing here which ChatGPT or perhaps AI in general doesn't yet understand fully when it comes to the human psyche"" Shayer said.

""ChatGPT has missed the more daring side of a good stock trader's personality or attitude to risk. They have to be willing to be speculative and have a certain amount of intuition on where markets might go. However similar to ChatGPT's discipline they also tend to be highly independent individuals.

He’s by far the most influential opponent of Bitcoin and the first of the six most famous crypto skeptics we’ll be talking about.

Xi hasn’t just paid lip service to being skeptical of Bitcoin. He’s also put his money where his mouth is through monetary policies. In 2013 China banned crypto from transactions.

The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) and other financial watchdogs issued a notice telling all banks to stop handling Bitcoin transactions. According to the notice Bitcoin was categorized as a special virtual commodity so it couldn’t function as a currency.

Additionally the ban argued that Bitcoin wasn’t backed by any state and was a potential outlet for laundering cash. The notice came when the price of Bitcoin was resurging from a bear market. The Chinese ban dampened the market’s enthusiasm for Bitcoin as an asset and sent its value spiraling downwards again. Following the ban the price of Bitcoin plummeted by 30%.

In 2017 following the popularity of Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) China banned ICOs. This was an attempt to stabilize the weakening Yuan and block money from leaving China illegally. The People’s Bank of China considered ICOs an illegal fundraising mechanism and stopped ICO platforms from issuing tokens. The bank also asked the ICOs to return money it had taken from investors.

While the crypto community was still struggling to understand this ban the country banned crypto exchanges as well.

In 2019 China’s attention turned to Bitcoin mining. The PBoC labeled it an undesirable industry and there were calls to ban it. Since almost half of Bitcoin’s mining was done in China that could have crippled crypto. However the ban was eventually averted.

Unfortunately that ban couldn’t be averted for long. In 2021 the Chinese government returned to the question of crypto mining and banned it for good. The country also banned crypto trading for good measure.

These measures may not have come directly from President Xi himself but they certainly couldn’t have happened without his approval.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zYWx0LW4tcGVwYS1yZXZlYWwtY2hhbGxlbmdlcy0xMzQ2MzkxMDAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Salt-N-Pepa Reveal What Challenges They Faced Early In Their Career Ahead Of The 2023 Grammy's,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9zYWx0LW4tcGVwYS1yZXZlYWwtY2hhbGxlbmdlcy0xMzQ2MzkxMDAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002562F45A080>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Here were the top performers.

The Nasdaq (^IXIC -0.03%) got off to a hot start in 2023.

After the tech-centric index fell 33% in 2022 investors seem to be eyeing bargains on the index and are hopeful that cooling inflation and slowing interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve will encourage a recovery this year.

With the Nasdaq jumping nearly 11% in January the index seems to be well on its way to a new bull market. Let's take a look at the three top-performing Nasdaq stocks (with a market cap of at least $2 billion) last month to see whether any of them are still worth buying.

1. Sotera Health (up 107%)

Sotera Health (SHC -2.56%) which specializes in sterilizing healthcare equipment jumped in January primarily for one reason.

The stock doubled on Jan. 10 after it settled an outstanding lawsuit saying its subsidiaries agreed to settle more than 870 ethylene oxide cases against Sterigenics. As part of the agreement which is not considered an admission of any liability for emissions from the Willowbrook facility that could have posed a health hazard to surrounding communities the company will pay $408 million.

Wall Street analysts cheered the announcement saying the agreement was much better than feared and several analysts upgraded the stock on the news.

The company has been dogged by lawsuits after safety concerns in the past but it seems like the worst fears are over and the stock returned to levels it traded at last September before other lawsuits emerged.

The settlement is a one-off event so investors shouldn't expect more blowout gains over the rest of the year. However the company's leading position in sterilization services gives it high margins and should help drive the stock's performance over the long term.

2. Dada Nexus (up 87%)

Dada Nexus (DADA -6.00%) is a local on-demand retail and delivery platform. It does business through the retail platform JD-Daojia and the delivery platform Dada Now. The company works closely with JD.com China's largest direct online retailer.

There was little company-specific news out on Dada Nexus last month. However the stock flew higher early in the month on signs of China reopening as government officials dropped strict COVID-related restrictions. That shift favors the company's retail and delivery platforms as its business is closely connected to JD.com and general retail demand.

There were also signs Dada performed well during the Chinese New Year celebration as management said JD Shop Now sales soared 90% during the Chinese New Year festival.

Chinese stocks had a strong January across the board. If the Chinese economy continues to reopen and the U.S. stock market keeps its positive momentum Dada Nexus could have a lot of room to run in 2023.

3. Peloton Interactive (up 63%)

Peloton Interactive (PTON -5.61%) rallied through much of January. The stock has more than doubled year to date after jumping another 27% on Feb. 1 following the release of its latest earnings report. In a letter to shareholders CEO Barry McCarthy said the company is poised for an ""epic comeback.""

There wasn't any major news out on Peloton in January specifically but the stock had fallen so sharply in the preceding two years that some investors likely saw an opportunity for a successful turnaround especially with the new year's bullish sentiment.

Those instincts proved right after Peloton reported its fiscal 2023 second-quarter earnings with overall revenue down sharply but subscription revenue up 22% year over year showing the company is growing its highest-margin business.

Because of the shift away from equipment sales its adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) loss narrowed from $266.5 million in the prior-year period to $122.4 million. Revenue of $792.7 million was down 30% year over year but still easily beat analysts' estimates showing how low expectations have become for Peloton.

The company still faces an uphill battle to get back to profitability and full health which will be difficult as subscriber growth has slowed. But the stock price has fallen so far there's a lot of upside potential if it can move toward stabilizing the business and future profitability.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9zYW1zdW5nLWdhbGF4eS1zMjItbWF5LWJlLWEtYmV0dGVyLWJ1eS10aGFuLXRoZS1nYWxheHktczIzLWhlcmVzLXdoedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung Galaxy S22 may be a better buy than the Galaxy S23 — here's why,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNndWlkZS5jb20vb3Bpbmlvbi9zYW1zdW5nLWdhbGF4eS1zMjItbWF5LWJlLWEtYmV0dGVyLWJ1eS10aGFuLXRoZS1nYWxheHktczIzLWhlcmVzLXdoedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000256267F5060>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Our findings showed that MMC promoted deposition of several ECM molecules in the cell-ECM layer in the gingival fibroblast cultures. In particular accumulation of key ECM proteins (collagen I cellular fibronectin tenascin C and LTBP1) and basement membrane components (collagen IV and laminin 1) were significantly increased by MMC. In contrast abundance of SPARC a matricellular protein that modulates cell-ECM interactions in wound healing40 was significantly reduced by MMC. Thus effect of MMC on accumulation of different ECM proteins appears distinct. In general previous studies using primary human fibroblasts from different tissues including cornea or different areas of skin have also demonstrated the ability of MMC to promote accumulation of various ECM proteins including collagen I III IV V and VII fibronectin perlecan and laminin 1. However results have been variable possibly due to differences in culture conditions MMCs used and origin of cells9434445464748.

The above data about distinct abundance of different ECM molecules in MMC cultures suggests that mechanical properties of the ECM-niche may also be different compared to nMMC cultures. In fact MMC has been shown to reduce stiffness of ECM by about 60–70% in cultures of neonatal fibroblasts4748. Mechanosignalling from ECM is a powerful regulator of gene expression49. Therefore according to principle of dynamic reciprocity150515253 MMC may promote deposition of compositionally and mechanically distinct ECM-niche by fibroblasts which in turn may regulate various fibroblasts functions such as proliferation morphology orientation and gene expression. In support of this our findings also showed that MMC significantly changed the expression of 25 out of 75 wound healing and ECM-related genes compared to nMMC condition at the 14-day endpoint. In particular MMC induced significant downregulation of 20 genes that encoded six ECM proteins (COL1A1 COL5A1 ELN SPARC POSTN and LUM) TIMP4 LOX LOXL3 LOXL4 and PLOD3 that modulate ECM maturation and stability3536 various integrin α- and β-subunits involved in cell-ECM interactions TGF-β signaling molecules (TGFB2 and EGR3) that among other things promote ECM deposition by fibroblasts5455 myofibroblast-associated ACTA241 and proangiogenic SDF137. In contrast MMC upregulated expression of MMP1 and MMP3 two enzymes involved in ECM remodeling5657 ITGA2 and ITGA3 genes encoding integrin subunits involved in ECM remodeling and cell adhesion to collagen and laminin respectively5657 and LAMB3 that encodes the β-chain present in laminin 5 (LM 332)58. Thus MMC suppressed expression of a set of genes that are involved in ECM deposition and increased those involved in ECM remodeling in gingival fibroblasts suggesting an anti-fibrotic effect. Interestingly when we compared gene expression over time no significant expression changes were noted after day 7 suggesting that while cultures still evolved with regards to protein accumulation and cell numbers the key conditions that regulate gene expression in both MMC and nMMC cultures were already established during the first 7 days. While extensive gene expression analyses as performed in this study have not been reported previously altered expression of a set of genes including increased expression and enzymatic activity of MMPs has been also found in human dermal fibroblast cultures treated with MMC (Ficoll 70/400)4648. However MMC (Ficoll 70/400) did not alter expression of various collagens fibronectin and certain cell markers including αSMA in human corneal fibroblasts43. Thus gene expression response to MMC treatment may be cell type-specific.

Our results showing reduced cell numbers and apparent wider intercellular spaces between cells in MMC cultures suggests that the density of cells in MMC is lower compared to nMMC cultures. The mechanisms by which MMC affects cell numbers are not known in detail. It is possible that the ECM niche established under MMC is less conducive for cell proliferation and/or promotes quiescence apoptosis necrosis or senescence resulting in a proportional change in proliferating and non-proliferating cells. These processes can be modulated by various factors including specific interactions of cell surface receptors with distinct ECM ligands mechanical signals from ECM and activation of ECM-bound growth factors5059606162 that maybe distinct under MMC culture condition. In addition the transcriptomic change induced by MMC may be also related to reduced cell numbers and/or density of the cultures. This is supported by previous studies with 3T3 and primary fibroblasts showing that cell growth and/or increased cell–cell contacts due to higher cell density can be linked to regulation of gene expression or protein levels636465666768697071. In addition altered cell morphology that may also occur in response to higher cell density can result in distinct gene expression72. We also noted significantly more variable orientation of the long axis of the cells and apparently wider cell morphology and intercellular spacing based on immunostaining of filamentous β-tubulin cytoskeleton in MMC compared to nMMC cultures. Thus the topological and other cues from the ECM which define cell orientation morphology and function73 may also be modulated by MMC.

Increased accumulation of total proteins both in MMC and nMMC cultures over time can be explained by increasing cell numbers in both culture conditions. It is noteworthy however that similar to primary human dermal fibroblasts cultured with MMCs (Ficoll 70/400)44 gingival fibroblasts showed significantly reduced cell numbers in MMC compared to nMMC cultures. Consequently while total protein accumulation in the cell-ECM layers was significantly higher in nMMC cultures when results were normalized for cell numbers both MMC and nMMC cultures showed similar protein levels. Comparison of MMC-induced gene expression and accumulation of corresponding ECM proteins in the cell-ECM layer showed different results. For instance while quantitation of collagen I and IV cellular fibronectin laminin 1 tenascin C and LTBP1 showed increased protein accumulation in MMC cultures expression of these genes was downregulated (COL1A1) or unchanged (COL4A1 EDA-FN1 TNC LAMA1 and LTBP1) by MMC. ECM proteins including collagen produced by fibroblasts can be secreted both into the culture medium and assembled into the cell-ECM layer. Use of MMC is expected to promote accumulation of secreted proteins into the cell-ECM layer. Therefore increased accumulation of the above molecules is likely caused by effect of MMC to promote their deposition from the medium to the cell-ECM layer rather than MMC-induced transcriptional regulation of gene expression. The only exception for the above was SPARC that showed reduced abundance in MMC cultures at both protein and mRNA levels. Thus SPARC levels may be regulated by transcriptional mechanisms that suppress its expression under the MMC culture condition. Another possibility is that remodeling of ECM including collagen by changes in MMP/TIMP ratio or its maturation that affects its stability maybe altered. However the gene expression analysis showed that while MMC significantly upregulated MMP1 and MMP3 it downregulated expression of MMP inhibitor TIMP4 and LOX LOXL3 LOXL4 and PLOD3 which mediate ECM crosslinking. Thus it appears that increased ECM stability may not explain increased ECM accumulation by MMC albeit measurement of mRNA levels do not necessarily reflect protein abundance or enzymatic activity.

Interestingly MMC also potently downregulated markers of profibrotic myofibroblast differentiation. Studies have indicated that fibroblast cultures in serum containing medium resemble granulation tissue in early wound healing where cells are actively proliferating and depositing ECM. In addition fibroblasts in such culture condition express a transcriptome that resembles early wound healing7174. Therefore it is interesting that MMC may drive gingival fibroblasts in this wound-like situation to a less profibrotic phenotype. Similar suppression of αSMA levels suggesting reduced myofibroblast differentiation have also been reported with cultures of primary human dermal fibroblasts using MMC (Ficoll 70/400)44. Considering the above changes of αSMA stress fibers over time it was interesting to note that in both nMMC and MMC cultures total αSMA levels (stress fiber-associated and non-associated αSMA) were significantly reduced with increasing culture time. Thus it appears that considerably higher proportion of αSMA in nMMC cultures is assembled into stress fibers compared MMC cultures. Expression of myofibroblast markers including αSMA are regulated by various factors such as composition of ECM including abundance of cellular fibronectin mechanosignalling from ECM cell density and presence of growth factors such as TGF-β14175 but their role in MMC-mediated suppression of myofibroblast phenotype is not known.

MMC also promoted deposition/expression of molecules that are associated with the basement membrane. In particular abundance of type IV collagen and laminin 1 was significantly increased by MMC. In addition expression of mRNA for LAMB3 was significantly increased while expression of COL7A1 encoding collagen VII that forms the anchoring fibrils9 was unaltered by MMC. Previous findings using primary abdominal human skin fibroblasts have demonstrated increased deposition of collagen IV and VII by treatment with MMCs (Ficoll 70/400)9 while studies using neonatal human skin fibroblasts have shown conflicting results whether MMC (Ficoll 70/400) promotes laminin 1 deposition4876. Thus the property of MMC to promote deposition/expression of basement membrane zone molecules by fibroblasts may depend on phenotype and/or origin of fibroblasts. ECM niche present at the basement membrane zone is a critical regulator of growth and function of epithelial stem cells77. Quiescent fibroblasts that reside in normal connective tissue do not appear to actively secrete basement membrane molecules such as collagen IV and laminin 1 and 5. However upon activation during certain physiological or pathological processes such as development wound healing and cancer stroma or in organotypic cultures with keratinocytes they participate in deposition of these molecules7879808182838485868788. Although published data is scarce fibroblasts produce only limited amounts basement membrane molecules in standard cultures and this maybe also cell type-specific. For instance compared to human gingival fibroblasts skin fibroblasts appear to produce only negligible levels of laminin 5 (LM 332) in culture89. The ability of MMC to promote deposition of basement membrane components by gingival fibroblasts may open a possibility to generate improved organotypic cultures consisting of epithelial cells and fibroblasts to study epithelial-mesenchymal interactions and to be further developed for regenerative therapy.

Effective decellularization that clears all cellular components including cytoskeletal molecules and DNA is essential to creating standardized and non-immunogenic cell type-specific CDMs for cell culture studies and therapeutic applications. However the traditional NH 4 OH/TX-100/DNase cell extraction method that was originally developed for cultures of mouse embryonic fibroblasts27 resulted in incomplete removal of cytoskeletal filamentous actin and β-tubulin from the human gingival fibroblast cultures. Latrunculin B an inhibitor of actin polymerization and destabilizer of actin filaments9091 has been used previously for effective decellularization of mouse and chicken muscle tissue2592 but it has not been tested with human fibroblast cultures. Our findings showed that latrunculin B followed by sodium deoxycholate and DNase treatment was efficient in removing cells actin β-tubulin and DNA from the cultures. Further analysis of the CDMs generated from MMC and nMMC cultures using this decellularization method showed that the above differences noted in accumulation of the individual ECM molecules in the cultures containing cells were replicated also in the corresponding CDMs. Thus MMC and the novel decellularization method can be used to generate distinct fibroblast-derived CDMs for further applications. However we also noted considerable total protein loss (up to > 80%) due to decellularization in both MMC and nMMC cultures. This is not surprising considering that the cultures were composed of ECM and layers of cells that were growing in high density. Therefore removing cells and likely also cell-associated molecules by decellularization is expected to cause dramatic reduction of total proteins in the cultures. Interestingly protein loss was distinct for different ECM molecules. For instance almost 80% of cellular fibronectin but only about 20% of tenascin C was lost due to decellularization in day 14 cultures. This difference could be explained by distinct distribution of cellular fibronectin and tenascin C in intracellular cell surface and ECM compartments and/or by different susceptibility of the ECM proteins to decellularization reagents. Interestingly loss of collagen I was significantly decreased in older cultures compared to earlier time points suggesting that collagen I fibrils become more stable over time. In addition collagen I loss was significantly lower in MMC compared to nMMC cultures. This could be caused by stabilization of collagen fibrils by increase in activity of lysyl oxidase and transglutaminase 2 that have been shown to promote collagen crosslinking under MMC conditions5. In any case based on previous studies9449394 and our findings different decellularization protocols may display distinct efficacy to remove cytoskeletal proteins depending on cell type and culture conditions. In addition fibroblast cultures generated with MMC may be partially protected from loss of fibronectin collagen I and IV and laminin 1.

The present proof-of-principle study provided first evidence of the utility of MMC technology in gingival fibroblast cultures. However finding out tissue type-specific properties of the cultures requires analysis of parallel cell cultures isolated from multiple gingival tissue donors and their comparison to cultures with cells isolated from other tissues such as skin. Future studies should also interrogate in more detail levels and function/activity of key proteins in cultures generated with MMC. These studies should also include large scale proteomes of human gingival fibroblast 3D cultures generated with MMC in comparison to the gingival tissue in vivo to characterize their similarities and differences in more detail. Based on our findings cell cultures and CDMs generated with MMC and the novel decellularization protocol could offer new tools to study in vivo-like cell-ECM interactions in vitro and provide a substitute for animal experiments. Furthermore if MMC-derived CDMs recapitulate the above anti-fibrotic effect found in MMC cultures they may have use as a less fibrotic wound healing model to study cell–matrix interactions. In addition they could be developed into novel tissue-specific cell-derived biomaterials that can be used to promote scar-free wound healing.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Two big factors behind the slow debut experts say are scant insurance coverage and a long setup time needed by many health systems.

Patients who surmount those challenges will step to the head of the line for a drug that delivers an uncertain benefit. Here's a closer look.

THE SITUATION

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration  from Japanese drugmaker Eisai in early January. It's for patients with mild or early cases of dementia tied to Alzheimer's disease.

Regulators used the FDA's accelerated pathway which allows drugs to launch before they're confirmed to benefit patients. In studies Leqembi modestly slowed the fatal disease but doctors aren't sure yet how that translates into things like greater independence for patients.

Patients get the drug by IV every two weeks. Eisai says the company has shipped Leqembi to U.S. specialty drug distribution centers. From there it can be delivered overnight to hospitals or medical centers.

Eisai spokeswoman Libby Holman said prescriptions for the drug have been written and they expect patients to start receiving it ""very soon.""

COST AND COVERAGE

A year's treatment will run about $26500. Patients who can afford that without insurance will be able to start the treatment if they are deemed a candidate for Leqembi and they find a doctor and health care system prepared to help them.

There are currently few options outside self-pay. Most of the patients who may be candidates for this drug are on Medicare and the federal program's coverage is narrow so far.

It has said it will cover treatments like Leqembi only for patients enrolled in certain research trials designed to test the drug.

There are no such studies currently accepting new patients.

There's a theoretical door (to coverage) that's completely slammed shut"" said Robert Egge chief public policy officer for the nonprofit Alzheimer's Association.

Medicare made that coverage decision last year when  hit the market.

Health insurers which run Medicare Advantage coverage have been sticking to that decision said a spokesman for the trade group America's Health Insurance Plans.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services which oversees Medicare said after Leqembi's approval that it may reconsider its coverage stance something the Alzheimer's Association has urged it to do.



Coverage also is likely to change if the drug receives full approval from the FDA. That could happen later this year.

In the meantime Eisai has an assistance program that provides Leqembi for free to some patients including those on Medicare. It's based partly on financial need.

DIAGNOSING

It can take anywhere from several months to more than a year for doctors to diagnose a patient and then figure out if that person is a candidate for Leqembi according to Dr. Sarah Kremen a neurologist with the Cedars-Sinai health system in Los Angeles.

That can depend on where a patient lives and the physician's expertise.

First a doctor must determine whether a patient has mild dementia.

Then the doctor has to decide what caused the condition. It could stem from Alzheimer's Parkinson's disease a stroke or a brain injury.

If it's related to Alzheimer's disease doctors must determine whether the patient's brain has an amyloid protein. The new drug aims to slow the progression of Alzheimer's by removing that protein.

After all that some doctors may hesitate to prescribe Leqembi because they don't have a good idea yet for how the drug will help the patient or affect their everyday life Kremen said. They have to consider that uncertainty against the brain swelling and bleeding that can develop in patients taking it.

""I think this benefit versus harm issue is going to weigh heavily"" she said.

DELIVERING TREATMENT

Health systems must first develop plans for delivering drugs like Leqembi before they start offering it. That can take months although some may have started before regulators approved the drug.

This planning might include training nurses on how to give the drug and making sure prescribing doctors know how to recognize candidates for it. Care providers also need a plan for how patients will be monitored once they start taking it.

Patients need repeated brain scans to check for side effects.

Doctors may want to know that such a plan is in place before they feel comfortable writing a prescription Kremen noted.

Hospital systems also will have to figure out how many patients might come to them for this drug and be able to cover all the costs tied to it. Those might include clinic nursing radiologist and pharmacy fees.

Frankly the hospital systems are going to have to decide if they want to offer it"" Kremen said. ""Is it worth the cost?

Eisai estimates that about 100000 people will be diagnosed and eligible to receive Leqembi in the United States by 2026. Representatives of the drugmaker declined to estimate how many people might receive it this year.",,,,,,

Brookfield a major infrastructure investor put up $2 billion in equity and borrowed $13 billion from a mix of foreign banks pension funds and sovereign wealth funds ­according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the details weren’t public. That model isn’t new to infrastructure assets just to semiconductors says Scott Peak Brookfield Infrastructure’s chief investment officer for North America.

For Intel bringing in a deep-pocketed investor to cover 49% of the plant’s cost helps to support finances stretched by an ­unprecedented expansion plan a tough competitive landscape and a steep industrywide downturn. (In late January the chipmaker gave one of its gloomiest forecasts ever sending shares tumbling.) When the deal was announced in August Intel described Brookfield’s rate of return as “somewhere between its cost of debt and equity” which it pegged between about 4% and 8.5%. Intel declined to provide more details.

How the investment plays out will demonstrate whether private equity firms and their growing infrastructure funds can be part of the plan to reassert US competitiveness in chip manufacturing. Governments in North America and Europe are trying to rebuild that strategic capability and reduce their reliance on plants in East Asia. Brookfield’s Peak estimates that $1 trillion of capital is required for what Brookfield considers “large-scale critical manu­facturing” in areas such as semiconductors aerospace auto and gigafactories data management and telecommunications.

“There are a lot of infrastructure categories that are well-­established that were not on an investor’s radar 5 or 10 years ago—think data centers towers and fiber” Peak says. “New asset classes evolve and with them come new models and contractual arrangements that attract the right investor base.”

The growing need for semiconductors and the high valuations of companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. have attracted interest from investors. Firms including KKR & Co. and Blackstone Inc. have raised war chests to invest in the space as the definition of infrastructure stretches beyond toll roads and ports to data centers cellphone towers and fiber networks. In December AT&T Corp. and a unit of BlackRock Inc. announced plans to form a joint venture that will provide internet service to US customers outside AT&T’s traditional 21-state local phone territory.

Intel which named the new funding model SCIP (sounds like “skip”) for semiconductor co-investment program is already being contacted by investors with access to pools of private capital looking to form partnerships on other fabrication plants known as fabs in Ohio and Germany according to people familiar with the matter. Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger said in January that the company expects to create a second SCIP this year.

“Given the multiyear horizon of our investments in capacity and product road map we are focused on creating multiple pools of capital to support our strategic investments and enhance our flexibility which is particularly important during short-term periods of business disruption” says Dave Zinsner Intel’s chief financial officer. SCIPs “provide the added benefit of better aligning our capital requirements with our cash-flow-generation timelines as new fabs typically require more than two years of investment before coming online and generating revenue.”

Building plants and making chips require expensive state-of-the art technology that can become obsolete in as little as five years. That makes it riskier than the projects infrastructure investors are accustomed to which remain in use for decades. So unlike a traditional joint venture in which profits and losses are shared according to each partner’s investment in this deal Intel provided Brookfield with some protection against losses. On the flip side if the plant proves more profitable most of the benefits will accrue to the chipmaker.

In the eyes of rating companies that downside protection negates one benefit of the deal: that Intel can keep about half of the cost off its balance sheet and preserve its credit rating. Instead the rating companies view Intel’s guarantee to Brookfield as debtlike. That may affect companies’ willingness to embrace similar deals says Jason Pompeii an analyst for Fitch Ratings. Financing multiple projects in the same way could weigh on Intel’s credit rating.

Intel could tweak the structure of future partnerships to make the deals less debtlike and it’s getting help from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. people familiar with the matter say. The company should also benefit from subsidies and other incentives in the US Chips and Science Act which is designed to boost domestic production of semi­conductors.

For Intel’s Gelsinger the Brookfield deal helps fund one of the first steps in his plan to remake the company and reclaim leadership in the $580 billion industry it once dominated. He’s introducing new technology at a faster rate than ever to make Intel’s plants the world’s best. The company is also building factories across the US and Europe to produce its products as well as to manufacture for other companies even rivals.

The rate on the Brookfield financing now looks attractive as inflation has sent the cost of borrowing up steeply. But in the high-stakes game of semiconductor manufacturing success will depend on whether Intel can keep those factories producing high-priced electronic components at maximum capacity. As one of the world’s few remaining large-scale manufacturers of semi­conductors it has an advantage. Work at existing plants in Arizona Oregon Ireland and Israel could be shifted to the new factories to make sure they’re performing at levels that will ensure the deal’s terms don’t become burdensome.

Moving to the landing on the north bank a layer of dark black rock caught the eye of explorer Thomas Nuttall who noted it in his journal. The location was Spadra Landing Johnson County Arkansas and the year was 1819. The black layer of rock was identified as a bituminous coal layer and became one of the most valuable materials mined in the state.

Eventually coal fields were found to exist in a 33-mile-wide 60-mile-long area running from Russellville in the east to the western border of the state. As pioneers moved into the area they began to extract small amounts of the coal to be used as heating fuel and for blacksmith shops. Some more enterprising individuals began to extract larger quantities to ship to New Orleans and other cities selling the black rock on the open market. Trains fueled by coal vastly increased the demand for coal and by 1880 Arkansas coal was fueling the development of the West. Greenwood to Hartford in Sebastian County was the center of the coal trade but huge mines existed in Johnson Franklin Pope and Logan counties as well. In 1907 coal mined in Arkansas reached a peak of 2.6 million tons. More than 106 million tons of coal were produced from 1880 to 2006. Mineral rights to one mine Greenwood No. 2 in Sebastian County sold for over $2 million while at Paris 13000 railroad cars of coal were shipped out in an eight-month period of time.

Fortunes were made but not by the hard-working coal miners who extracted the coal. Working for an average of 75 cents an hour they risked life and limb as they crawled into mines sloping downward from the surface. Using a pick and shovel they removed the coal from between sandstone rock layers that shifted and settled from the tremendous weight above. As more coal was demanded the miners crawled on hands and knees into darkness lighted only by carbide lamps set dynamite into the coal layers and waited as the tremendous charges shook the earth loosening the valuable coal for extraction. Newspapers were filled with stories of the resulting toll on life and limb.

Working on my dissertation I interviewed several older miners. Alan Heard of Greenwood described the worst day of his life: ""My dad and I were in the Excelsior mine near Hackett. Hearing a loud noise my dad screamed for us to lay down on the floor. Instantly blue flame flew up the tunnel scorching our clothing and burning exposed flesh."" Seven men were killed in the explosion their bodies carried out by fellow miners who worked hours to remove them from the entrapment. Three of the men killed were brothers.

Most mine accidents were smaller in scale involving the death of only one or two individuals. Falling down a shaft electrocution being kicked by a mule or hit by falling rock were small in scope but contributed to a cumulative large sum of people all tragedies on a smaller scale. More insidious was the damage done to health as the workers breathed the dust resulting from mining. As they aged black lung afflicted the respiratory system resulting in coughing and black spittle from bleeding in the lungs. Worn-out backs and limbs resulted in painful arthritis robbing years from the miners' lives. As H.B. Stewart a one-time miner and longtime Greenwood coach told me: ""Miners worked hard lived hard and died young.""

A hard life but it was one that that made a decent living for the family. Many of the men told me that they wouldn't change the life they lived for any other. As one of the miners explained to me ""millions of dollars of coal came out of those mines. The coal fueled the growth of America and during World War II we would not have won without coal as a fuel source.

""So much good came out of the rock but at the end of the day the most valuable thing to come out of that mine was the miner."""

The conservative political network associated with billionaire Charles Koch won't be backing former President Trump's 2024 presidential bid becoming the latest GOP megadonor to distance themselves from Trump. Driving the news: The Americans for Prosperity Action the leading political arm of the Koch network will support a candidate in the Republican Party primary ""who can lead our country forward and who can win"" Emily Seidel the CEO of AFP and a senior adviser to AFP Action wrote in a memo issued Sunday.

""Our country must move past the current political situation — we’ve got to turn the page on the past several years"" Seidel wrote.

State of play: Seidel wrote that a ""hard truth"" facing the Republican Party is that it has been ""nominating bad candidates who are advocating for things that go against core American principles.""

""The American people are rejecting them"" she added.

To fix the problem ""better candidates"" are needed which will necessitate getting ""involved in elections earlier and in more primaries"" according to Seidel.

""The best thing for the country would be to have a president in 2025 who represents a new chapter"" Seidel wrote noting that Americans ""have shown that they’re ready to move on.""

While the memo does not mention Trump by name an official with AFP Action told CNN that the group does not intend to support Trump CNN reported.

While the memo did not outline a spending budget for 2024 federal records indicate that AFP's affiliated super PAC spent more than $69 million in the 2022 cycle the Washington Post reported.

Now after more than five decades the last brand-new 747 has been built.

Among those paying tribute to the aircraft was actor John Travolta who attended a Boeing tribute to the 747 last week in Everett Washington.

""As a pilot I know how great this plane is to fly"" Travolta said. ""There is nothing like seeing a 747 take flight to remind you that there's also magic here.""

CBS News' Kris Van Cleave visited Boeing's Everett plant as the plane was in final assembly just days before it rolled off the line made its first test flight and was bathed in about 120 gallons of paint.

Sherri Mui built 747s for the last 15 years her father started working on the same line 43 years ago.

""Every time you finish a job you know that it's going to be the last time you do it. And it just kind of tugs at your heartstrings"" Mui said. ""My favorite thing about the 747 would just be that it's so iconic that you see it in the sky you see it at the airport and you know exactly what that is. And it brings a lot of pride knowing that hey yes I helped build that.""

""It's not just another airplane"" Mui told Van Cleave.

The final 747 in assembly

The 747 was the world's first jumbo jet. Twice as big as any other airliner when it first flew back in 1969. Pan-Am welcomed the first passengers on board a year later.

With its spiral staircase first-class lounge and iconic hump it was an instant hit.

""This airplane marks the point in history the first time that any person on planet Earth could get on an airplane and fly"" Boeing historian Michael Lombardi told Van Cleave.

""It democratized air travel"" Van Cleave said.

Lombardi agreed.

""Because of its size its range its economy. Now flight was affordable.""

Over more than 118 million flight hours and counting the 747's four engines have carried millions of passengers six U.S. presidents and even the space shuttle across the country and around the world.

After 1574 of the 747s were built this marks the end of the line for the Queen of the Skies at Boeing. But for the thousands of people in the Everett plant who work on the airplane it really marks the beginning of a new chapter. They're all going onto new jobs on other lines building new planes that will fly for decades to come.

While those newer more fuel-efficient planes are bringing about the end of this queen's reign especially as a passenger plane the final 747 a freighter will likely be delivering goods for years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRyaXZlLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xhc3QtYm9laW5nLTc0Ny1ldmVyLXByb2R1Y2VkLWRyYXdzLWZsaWdodC1wYXRoLWZhcmV3ZWxsLW1lc3NhZ2UtdG8tcXVlZW4tb2YtdGhlLXNraWVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Last Boeing 747 Ever Produced Draws Flight Path Farewell Message to 'Queen of the Skies':,"One of the most iconic objects in the history of design is out of production. The Boeing 747 is no more after a 54-year reign as the Queen of the Skies. It changed aviation as we know it became an icon of travel and garners adoration for the impact it made. The aircrew of the last 747 paid tribute in their own way: by drawing in the skies above Washington state.

The final 747 is a 747-8F which is a freighter variant. It went to Atlas Airlines who took delivery of the aircraft at Boeing’s facility in Everett Washington. Bearing the tail number N863GT the crew took off from Paine Field in Everett and flew across Washington state only pausing to draw a special farewell. The crew drew a path that read 7-4-7 with a crown above the numbers in tribute to the so-called Queen of the Skies.

The last Boeing 747 a 747-8F. Boeing

Looking at the flight path on Flightradar24 it’s shockingly big. The Atlas crew flew over a significant portion of the state to draw the crown and did a wonderful job at making it look pretty decent. It also took the majority of the flight time with a total of two and a half hours dedicated to tracing the tribute. It was seriously technical flying. After drawing the tribute the crew flew directly to the Cincinnati Atlas Airlines hub.

On the ground a large crowd was in attendance to see the 747 leave its home since 1967. According to the BBC John Travolta who has flown a 747-400 and is an aviation enthusiast was in the crowd as well as the original team of people that developed the original 747 in just 28 months. It was the first of its kind a twin-aisle double-decker jetliner that could carry more people in comfort on transoceanic flights.

With no four-engined double-decker replacements on the horizon the 747 outlasted the much newer Airbus A380. The realities of modern airline travel have shown that twin-engined widebody jets can do the same job with less fuel consumption thus rendering the 747 obsolete.

""Phonnie"" Trent was a nationally renowned jazz pianist and band leader from Fort Smith. He led the Alphonso Trent Orchestra a group of young Black musicians who toured the country; made several recordings; and had a lengthy engagement at the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas. During that engagement the band became the first group of Black musicians to be featured on regional broadcasts over WFAA radio in Dallas.

Alphonso Trent was born in Fort Smith on Oct. 24 1902 the son of E.O. Trent and Hattie S. Smith. Trent's father was one of the first Black graduates of Ohio State University and served as principal of Fort Smith's Lincoln High School. Trent began his musical education at an early age. While still in his teens he gained valuable experience as a pianist working around western Arkansas and eastern Oklahoma in Sterling Todd's Rose City Orchestra and the Quinn Band. Because his father was a prominent educator Trent received a strong classroom education and in the fall of 1923 began attending Shorter College in North Little Rock.

Shortly after arriving in Little Rock he began playing piano with a group led by Eugene Crooke called the Syncho Six. However because of Trent's strong musical leadership and his skill at booking engagements the band's name was changed to the Alphonso Trent Orchestra. In spring 1925 the band set out for Texas playing street corners for nickels and dimes and an occasional dance engagement.

A bellman from the Adolphus Hotel heard Trent's orchestra at a dance and convinced the hotel's manager to book the group for a two-week engagement in the hotel's second ballroom. This was soon extended into an 18-month engagement during which the orchestra received exposure through broadcasts over the 50000-watt radio station WFAA.

Trent's broadcasts from the Adolphus were the first for a Black orchestra and reached an audience throughout the central United States and Canada. The orchestra even performed at the inaugural ball of Texas' first female governor Miriam A. Ferguson.

During the long engagement at the Adolphus the band grew to 11 musicians. All members received the same pay and were expected to contribute ideas to the development of the musical arrangements. Under Trent's musical direction the band emphasized good tone quality (actual tone or timbre of the instruments) intonation (tuning of notes and chords) and showmanship.

While in Dallas Trent married Essie Mae Grissom whom he had met at a party held in the band's honor. The couple never had children but Trent had previously had a son Alphonso B. Trent born in 1922 to a woman in Fort Smith.

From summer 1926 to October 1927 Trent's orchestra toured major hotels throughout Texas Arkansas Louisiana and Mississippi. For the next two years the Alphonso Trent Orchestra played in Cincinnati; Louisville and Lexington Ky.; Buffalo N.Y.; and other cities. During this time the band made its first recordings four songs for the Gennett Company in Richmond Ind.

In summer 1929 the Alphonso Trent Orchestra performed at a resort in Port Stanley Ontario. At the close of the engagement the band headed for its one and only date in New York a two-week stint at the Savoy Ballroom. At the end of the two weeks Meyer Davis offered Trent an extended run at the Arcadia Ballroom but he refused opting instead for a higher-paying job at the Plantation Club in Cleveland.

During the engagement in early 1930 at the Plantation Club a fire of suspicious origins consumed the establishment and destroyed the orchestra's instruments and library. Trent's family came to the rescue buying new instruments for the group. Jobs during the Great Depression were scarce and the band hobbled back to Fort Smith. Trent kept his musicians busy however using his hometown as a base of operations.

The Alphonso Trent Orchestra made one last road trip in the winter of 1932-'33 but Trent did not accompany them. Soon however he had another band on the road a small group touring the Dakotas Wyoming Colorado and Texas during the 1930s and early 1940s. He continued to promote young musical talent including pioneering jazz guitarist Charlie Christian.

After World War II Trent settled permanently in Fort Smith to manage the family's real estate holdings and beginning in 1953 the city's first housing project Elm Grove Homes. He remained active in the music business but restricted his performances to local nightclubs.

Trent died of a heart attack in Fort Smith on Oct. 14 1959. He is buried in the city's Oak Cemetery.

In an interview with PTI Godrej Properties Executive Chairman Pirojsha Godrej said the company's new business development -- which means acquisition of land parcels through outright purchases and joint ventures with landowners to build new projects -- will cross at least Rs 30000 crore in the 2022-23 financial year  double than the annual guidance of Rs 15000 crore.""We are very happy with the quarter gone by. Operationally it has been a very strong quarter. It ended up being an extraordinary quarter for business development. As opposed to the full year annual guidance of Rs 15000 crore just within the quarter we did Rs 23000 crore. We are very happy about the outcome"" he highlighted.The company has added 15 new projects so far this fiscal with a total estimated saleable area of 23.42 million square feet and total estimated booking value of Rs 27500 crore.In the third quarter alone Godrej Properties added 9 new projects in Delhi-NCR Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and Pune with an expected sales booking of Rs 23050 crore.Asked whether the company would revise the business development guidance for the FY'23 Godrej said ""It's hard to project. Visibility is good for the current quarter. We are very certain that we will cross two times of our guidance. How much more that we will have to see.""Sitting on a huge cash flow the company has acquired more land parcels through outright purchases in this fiscal.However Godrej said the company is in talks with many landowners for join developments as well.He noted that housing demand continues to be strong even during this quarter despite rise in interest rates on home loans and appreciation in property prices.On the operational front he said the company's sales bookings rose 77 per cent year-on-year to Rs 8181 crore in the April-December period as against Rs 4613 crore in the year-ago period.Sales booking during the October-December quarter jumped over two-fold to Rs 3252 crore from Rs 1541 crore in the year-ago period.The sales bookings in the third quarter were the highest for the company for any quarter ever Godrej highlighted.""We have already done nearly Rs 8200 crore of sales bookings in the first three quarters of this fiscal year and hopefully we will definitely cross Rs 10000 crore annual guidance"" Godrej said.Nevertheless he said Godrej Properties will not revise upwards its annual guidance for sales bookings.According to an investors' presentation out of the total sales bookings in April-December of this fiscal the residential segment contributed Rs 8124 crore while commercial properties were just Rs 57 crore.Geographically Godrej Properties sold properties worth Rs 2675 crore in Delhi-NCR Rs 2053 crore in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) Rs 1452 crore in Bengaluru and Rs 1376 crore in Pune.

Lord and Taylor previously occupied the storefront at 760 Boylston Street.

Boston Properties Inc. reported last fall that it had signed a retail lease at the building part of the Prudential shopping center without naming the tenant following reports of advanced talks by the Boston Business Journal that Dick’s had taken the space.

Boston Properties securities filings show that the 118000-square-foot building will be occupied in the second quarter of 2024.

Dick’s launched House Of Sport in 2022 and has three stores in Rochester NY; Knoxville TN; and Minnetonka MN. Another store is scheduled to open at the Oakdale Mall in Johnson City TN in 2023.

House of Sport stores offer consumers an outdoor turf field and running track that converts to an ice-skating rink during the winterm indoor 35-foot rock climbing wall a tech-enhanced batting cage golf hitting bays and a putting green.

The seven-acre parcel at 102 Border St. in East Boston with its stunning views of the harbor and the Charlestown Navy Yard across the water would seem like a great place to build some affordable housing in a neighborhood that sorely needs it.

Now the East Boston Community Development Corp. has gone to Suffolk Superior Court to get that parcel along with an adjacent building the CDC also owns removed from the DPA after the state Office of Coastal Zone Management opted against doing so after a thorough review of East Boston’s waterfront. The lawsuit that the CDC filed on Jan. 23 accuses the state agency of ignoring its own regulations and argues the site is better suited for housing than marine industrial work.

The fight in Suffolk Superior is the latest clash over the state’s four-decades-old port-area rules which are designed to protect industrial waterfront properties from conversion to commercial or residential development — and to hold onto some of the blue-collar jobs that go with them. These zones have become an increasingly common battleground amid the pressures to build along Boston Harbor.

The most prominent of these battles is playing out in Everett where city officials want to remove a big piece of the Mystic power plant property from the port area there to enable large-scale redevelopment and open up a swath of the city’s riverfront.

In East Boston the stakes include the potential for roughly 60 units of affordable housing and about 30000 square feet of space for a community group. That’s what East Boston CDC president Al Caldarelli wants to build at 102 Border St. But he can’t because it’s in a DPA — a legacy of the area’s history as a shipbuilding yard.

Caldarelli said his organization has marketed 102 Border St. for marine industrial uses but has had no takers since acquiring it in late 2015 from Trinity Financial which developed the Boston East apartments next door. Meanwhile this stretch of Border Street has become increasingly residential — with Boston East opening in 2016 and the Coppersmith Village apartments opening across the street two years later.

“It became more and more obvious that it was not a site for marine-related activities” Caldarelli said of 102 Border St. “In 100 years there hasn’t been one whiff of industrial on it. It’s the site of the original Donald McKay shipbuilding [yard]. Maybe that’s what gets into their head.”

Caldarelli had hoped the site and a neighboring building his nonprofit occupies at 80 Border St. would have been removed from the DPA during a three-year review of the East Boston shoreline that the state coastal zone office recently completed. But the state agency declined the CDC’s request opting only to remove a few parcels in nearby Jeffries Point from the DPA because they already include or abut residential buildings.

So now East Boston CDC is suing arguing that Border Street is not conducive to heavy truck traffic particularly as the area has become more residential and that 102 Border St. is not easily accessible to ships because the harbor’s edge consists of riprap with no docking area. The closest shipping channel is hundreds of feet away separated from the shore by shallow tidal flats that would need extensive dredging. Keeping the parcel “industrial” the organization says will just keep it empty.

“We don’t view this as a choice between maritime industrial uses and affordable housing” said Valerie Moore a real estate lawyer who represents the East Boston CDC. “It’s a choice of doing nothing or having affordable housing.”

A spokeswoman for the coastal zone management office declined to comment pointing to the agency’s ruling in December on these East Boston properties. That decision cites improvements — restoring seawalls and removing dilapidated pilings for example — at 102 Border St. that make it easier to accommodate marine industrial uses and notes 80 Border St.’s industrial use including by previous occupant Wigglesworth Machinery. The agency said it was unable to take the nearby residential developments — such as Boston East — into consideration because they were not in the DPA to begin with and state regulations specifically limit reviews to land within the port area.

Moore said it’s possible that the East Boston CDC could end up asking the Legislature to remove the sites in question from the DPA but that’s no sure thing either. Such a move was tried unsuccessfully last year for the Mystic site in Everett and remains under consideration as an alternative to going through the multiyear boundary review process overseen by the coastal zone management office.

“We’re certainly considering all our options including a legislative effort” Moore said of the Border Street parcels. “Certainly a legislative effort ... would require a lot of political support.”

Boston Harbor Now president Kathy Abbott said the debates about the East Boston and Everett sites underscore the need for the state to revisit the DPA rules in a way that preserves deep-water port access while preventing these “one-off” exemption bills from being pushed through the Legislature.

“We would rather see a thoughtful look at the regulations and what needs to be done to bring DPAs into the 21st century as opposed to forcing cities and towns to go into the Legislature on each and every one of these to go around the regulations” Abbott said. “That does not seem like the best solution. It doesn’t address the [underlying] problem.”

Negotiating rent with a landlord might seem like a hard battle to win but it’s entirely doable if you can prove two things: 1) the rent being charged is higher than similar units elsewhere and 2) you’re a model tenant who pays rent on time. Such negotiations can be done whether you’re applying to rent a new apartment or just want cheaper rent where you currently reside. Read on for what you need to know about how to ask for lower rent.

Can you negotiate rent? How to discuss rent before you move in

Can you negotiate rent before you move in? As a prospective tenant it’s a bit harder to persuade a new landlord to accept lower rent since you two have no history together. A competitive market counts here: Landlords who’ve been struggling to fill apartments will be far more open to rent negotiation than most. If they’re desperate they’d probably rather strike a deal than watch another perspective tenant search for homes for rent elsewhere.

Here are some ways to stand out.

Prepare a stellar application. “The best way I’ve seen renters negotiate rent is to be an amazing applicant” says Glenn Carter  a real estate investor at Condo.Capital. That means submitting your application quickly and including tax returns proof of employment and references from previous landlords saying you pay rent on time. “This will show potential landlords you’re diligent and will treat the property well” Carter says. You may even offer to sign a longer lease such as a two-year lease to make the deal even more attractive.

You may even offer to sign a longer lease such as a two-year lease to make the deal even more attractive. Show a high credit score. If possible also bring a recent document showing your high credit score which indicates you reliably pay your debts on time. “As a landlord I would accept lower rent from a dependable source” says Boston landlord Steve Silberberg . People who pay their credit card bills and make other debt payments are more likely to pay their rent on time too.

People who pay their credit card bills and make other debt payments are more likely to pay their rent on time too. Gather rental statistics. Comb through online listings to find out the rents of comparable properties in the area. Also research how long the property you’re interested in—or similar real estate in the area—has been on the market. When you speak to the landlord have a printout of comparable units that are slightly lower in rent and if the unit has been unoccupied have this information on hand as well. Perhaps a similar one-bedroom apartment rent has an amenity this unit does not for example. Then point out how these factors make the landlord’s rental terms above a reasonable market-rate price.

Perhaps a similar one-bedroom apartment rent has an amenity this unit does not for example. Then point out how these factors make the landlord’s rental terms above a reasonable market-rate price. Suggest a realistic rent reduction. Be sure to have a realistic rental price ready based on your research. Don’t start the negotiation with a lowball offer but let your first rental offer be one your landlord can haggle with you on. Make your case in a nonconfrontational way. Say something like “I love this place and am looking for a long-term commitment. Unfortunately my personal finance budget is X. Would you be willing to meet that in exchange for signing a longer lease?” Another option might be to ask for a free month instead of a lower rate.

How to ask for lower rent: What to do as a current tenant

Can you negotiate rent as a current tenant? Yes and you’ll actually have more leverage—that is if you’ve paid rent on time and otherwise proved to be a good tenant.

Asking for a rent reduction

Time it right. Start the conversation shortly before your lease renewal is due. Begin by saying you’re not thinking of getting a new place but rather want to continue renting—for the right price. Then state the facts: You like your current apartment but you’re seeing cheaper monthly rents elsewhere.

Then state the facts: You like your current apartment but you’re seeing cheaper monthly rents elsewhere. Point out the benefits of your staying. Remind the landlord that keeping you as a renter saves him the hassle of listing a vacancy showing the apartment screening applicants and losing potential rental income while he looks for new tenants.

Offer something in return. Ask your landlord what he wants in exchange for a lower rent—a longer lease commitment higher security deposit or prepaying a month or two—to make your request fit his needs.

Ask your landlord what he wants in exchange for a lower rent—a longer lease commitment higher security deposit or prepaying a month or two—to make your request fit his needs. Demonstrate you’re a model tenant. Frame your reduction in rent as a return on investment because you have a stellar payment record and value as a tenant. Remind your landlord you pay rent on time keep your place in good condition and help your neighbors. “If less reliable tenants miss even a half-month’s rent during their lease that translates into a loss” says Silberberg. “I recently accepted $150 less per month on a year and a half lease for very stable renters instead of a year lease with less stable tenants.”

You may also want to tactfully bring your landlord’s attention to anything in your unit that’s worn out or needs painting. Then suggest that the current condition of the items in question merits a proportionate reduction in the rent price. You can also offer to repair or replace these items yourself in exchange for reduced rent.

You can also offer to repair or replace these items yourself in exchange for reduced rent. Suggest a temporary reduction in the rental price. If you suspect your landlord won’t budge on a permanent reduction in rental rates consider suggesting a temporary reduction instead—say a break for a few months during off-peak seasons when it’s harder to rent places out or when the rental market is slower. “I’m most open to price negotiations anytime between November and January” says landlord Domenick Tiziano of AccidentalRental.com. “If I have a vacancy a good candidate has a pretty good chance of talking me down a few bucks.”

Even if your landlord won’t reduce your rent there are plenty of other ways to save money. One no-brainer is to reduce credit card debt (and interest payments) by getting free credit counseling at sites like the National Foundation of Credit Counseling.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hc3NsaXZlLmNvbS9yZWFsZXN0YXRlLW5ld3MvMjAyMy8wMi9zZWUtYWxsLWhvbWVzLXNvbGQtaW4taGFtcGRlbi1jb3VudHktamFuLTI5LXRvLWZlYi01Lmh0bWzSAXlodHRwczovL3d3dy5tYXNzbGl2ZS5jb20vcmVhbGVzdGF0ZS1uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDIvc2VlLWFsbC1ob21lcy1zb2xkLWluLWhhbXBkZW4tY291bnR5LWphbi0yOS10by1mZWItNS5odG1sP291dHB1dFR5cGU9YW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,See all homes sold in Hampden County Jan. 29 to Feb. 5,"The following is a listing of all real estate transfers in Hampden County reported from Jan. 29 to Feb 5.

For the last 67 years “Ferozsons has always been guided by our philosophy to put patients first and focus on critical unmet medical needs to save lives. We continue to bring most-needed medicines to Pakistanis at an accessible cost” Osman Khalid Waheed CEO of Ferozsons Laboratories Limited said in an exclusive interview with Gulf News.

Waheed’s great-grandfather Maulvi Ferozuddin Khan laid the foundations of the business group in 1894 with a vision to make a meaningful contribution to education and health. Ferozsons established its pharmaceuticals plant in 1956 to meet the health needs of the newly independent Pakistan.

The founder’s vision was “to focus on commercially sustainable work that had a direct impact on human development.” His philosophy is embraced by the company to this day. “We try never to forget that medicine is for the people” and the profits follow says Waheed who holds a bachelor’s degree in Economics from Harvard University and serves on the boards of the Lahore University of Management Sciences and several companies.

Focus areas

In the last six decades Ferozsons Labs has emerged as one of the leading Pakistani pharmaceutical manufacturing companies dedicated to providing advanced and affordable treatments for the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diabetes cancer and heart diseases through its diverse range of more than 100 life-saving products (medications and devices). A major focus for the company is diabetes which is a leading cause of death in Pakistan with 33 million adults suffering from it the third highest number in the world after China and India.

Reducing the burden of Hepatitis C

Ferozsons has long been focused on treating hepatitis C a virus spread by contact that infects the liver. Pakistan has the world’s largest population of hepatitis patients with around 12 million infected by hepatitis B or C according to the World Health Organization (WHO) mainly due to the re-use of syringes and unhygienic health services. Hepatitis C is curable but the treatment was previously difficult and painful involving shots of interferon with flu-like side effects.

In 2014 US biotech company Gilead Sciences introduced a cure in the form of tablets called Sovaldi (Sofosbuvir) for treating hepatitis C. Ferozsons immediately signed a special access agreement with Gilead to make this revolutionary drug available to Pakistanis.

The drug which cost $84000 for a 12-week course in the US was made available in Pakistan for less than 2% of its US price to ensure its accessibility for the local population. In the first year the affordable and effective drug with a 95% cure helped treat over 70000 patients and has so far improved the lives of a total of 250000 patients in Pakistan.

Osman Khalid Waheed

The 12-week hepatitis C treatment in Pakistan now costs below Rs15000 (US$54) which is the lowest in the world. Ferozsons ensured direct-to-home delivery so that the drug reached patients who needed it rather than being misused for financial gain.

Describing it as one of the achievements of the Pakistani health industry Waheed said: “The impact of the Gilead partnership has been significant” as it transformed the treatment of hepatitis C. “From a very painful and not-so-effective treatment we went to a guaranteed cure almost free from any side effects”.

Pakistan’s first biotech plant

Ferozsons is the pioneer in setting up Pakistan’s first biotech manufacturing facility in Lahore through a joint venture with Argentina’s Bagó Group in 2008. The plant was established in response to the high cost of importing biological drugs such as treatments for kidney dialysis cancer and hepatitis C more sustainably and at a lower cost. The joint venture led to direct investment in Pakistan and “increased manufacturing capability in an area where we had zero capacity.”

Biomanufacturing is the production of biological medicines from living organisms. The powerful biologic drugs such as for cancer treatment are different from small molecule drugs such as aspirin due to their highly complex production process. The Pakistani firm is also the distribution partner of Boston Scientific a leading American producer of medical devices for treating heart disease and other therapeutic areas.

First Pakistani company to produce COVID-19 drug

In May 2020 during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic Ferozsons in Pakistan became one of five South Asian manufacturers authorised to produce and distribute the antiviral drug Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 in 127 countries. This was the first time a Pakistani manufacturer was selected for an international supply chain under technology transfer from Gilead.

Osman Khalid Waheed “It took us about 12 weeks from signing the licence to producing the first batch. It was all done at lightning speed” Waheed shared.

They started supplying Remdesivir to Pakistan in June 2020 and began exporting globally in September 2020 to countries such as Ukraine Indonesia the Philippines Costa Rica and African countries. This achievement was seen as an important step forward for Pakistan on both the health and economic fronts improving access to coronavirus treatment for citizens and providing export opportunities.

Expansion and exports

While the pandemic severely impacted lives and economies globally it also offered research and investment possibilities. Ferozsons invested in a large advanced highly-automated manufacturing plant to expand its manufacturing capacity and be ready to “produce specialty therapeutics and vaccines” in the future. The plant expected to be completed by mid-2023 “will produce specialty injections and treatments including insulins as well as select vaccines for hepatitis B and possibly for COVID-19 and influenza later.” This plant will have the ability to produce the most sensitive drugs that were imported before. The raw materials will still need to be imported as Pakistan’s pharmaceutical industry lacks the necessary ingredients. Ferozsons currently exports to 24 countries in Eastern Europe Africa Asia and South America.

Industry issues in Pakistan

While discussing ambitious plans the CEO of Ferozsons Labs said that companies could only become exporters if they are sustainable at home and lamented that Pakistan’s pharma industry has “never been financially viable due to the arbitrary price fixation mechanism imposed by the government” that is at odds with rising production costs. Despite its growth and reach “the industry faces issues around irrational drug pricing limited intellectual property rights protection lack of timely regulatory approvals and low investments for research and technological advancements” according to Qazi Mansoor Dilawar chairman of Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers’ Association (PPMA). One key challenge Osman Waheed cited was the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) controlling both quality and prices with “the focus being on fixing prices rather than raising the bar for quality control.” The result is that Pakistan currently has no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved labs according to experts.

Role of pharma in economy

On the contribution of healthcare to the world economy Waheed mentioned the growth of healthcare in India and Bangladesh. He recalls that Pakistan was the first in the region in 1992 to deregulate the pharma sector but reversed the mechanism within three months. India now exports pharmaceutical products worth $24 billion whereas Pakistan only earns under $300 million from pharma exports. Bangladesh is also an emerging giant in pharma with multiple FDA-approved facilities.

Waheed suggests moving away from price fixation to deregulation and oversight by an independent board to improve competitiveness in the industry. Price fixing in Pakistan is not only hurting the industry but the patients as well resulting in repeated shortages and the rise of smuggled and counterfeit drugs that fill the vacuum created in the absence of life-saving medicines. At the moment the health sector is besieged by shortages of multiple drugs needed to treat cancer diabetes tuberculosis and heart disease because of financial losses to the industry and import restrictions amid the economic crisis. The foreign currency shortage has disrupted the supply chain for both domestic production and exports.

Industry experts say revisions of laws and policies are critical for this sector to survive. “Pharma industry is facing an existential threat and is headed towards a shutdown if the government does not take quick action” Waheed warned. Drug pricing has always been treated as a political issue in Pakistan. “An industry that gets zero subsidies no support from the government is hostage to prices fixed by the government. It is completely irrational and creates a situation where everybody loses - the patient who is exposed to smuggled and counterfeit medicine; the government which directly bears the blame for shortages and the rise of counterfeit drugs; and the industry which is being driven to bankruptcy because of this failure of governance” says Waheed.

But there is still time and hope. This same industry given the space can be a reliable partner for meeting the country’s public health challenges and also be a meaningful contributor to diversifying the country’s export base."

Q: What does the treatment landscape currently look like for patients with GU cancers and how does it differ from other areas?



Dr. Walker: GU cancer research has progressed significantly over the last several years in both the metastatic setting and in earlier stages of disease. Previously the standard of care for many GU cancer types – including kidney cancer bladder cancer and prostate cancer – was chemotherapy. However over the last several years we’ve seen many new modalities and mechanisms come into play – including immunotherapy targeted agents antibody drug conjugates and radioligand therapy in the metastatic setting as well as some new data on immunotherapies in earlier lines of treatment for both kidney and bladder cancer. This is a really exciting time. Since GU cancers extend over multiple different tumor types I think we have an opportunity here to explore a wide variety of mechanisms both alone and in combination.

Q: In your opinion what are the most exciting advancements or areas of research in this field?

Dr. Walker: Many new mechanisms have been established as standards of care across kidney bladder and prostate cancers in recent years. Not only is BMS at the forefront with various treatments in these areas but we’ve also had a great opportunity to collaborate across the global cancer community including with industry partners and academic research institutions. In my opinion a lot of the excitement lies in this ability to pursue novel combinations across mechanisms and expand the research to explore novel options.

One area where we’re trying to establish new standards of care is across specific patient populations. For some GU cancers there aren’t known specific genomic targets or biomarkers of relevance which presents a challenge for physicians trying to tailor treatments to each individual patient. So that’s an area where we can continue to improve to meet the needs of even more patients. Currently treatments are mostly being used broadly across patient segments. It’s important to continue to collaborate and conduct translational research to establish the best treatments for each segment to improve outcomes for all patients.

Q: What options are being explored in metastatic stages of these diseases? How about in earlier stages?

Dr. Walker: In the metastatic setting we’re continuing to find new modalities that are relevant across GU malignancies. We’ve come a long way with treatments such as immunotherapies and targeted agents. The most interesting question being asked in research now is: how we can we combine these? Exploring combination approaches can help us find ways to serve patients who are still facing high unmet needs. While the scientific community has significantly increased long-term survival benefits in this field and have achieved longer durable responses we still have patients who don’t respond. Combining these proven agents and partnering to find new drugs that may work here is crucial.

The same applies in the earlier stages of disease. We’ve done a lot of great research in the metastatic setting and now we’re evaluating how we can apply those learnings to the earlier stages of the disease and testing whether these mechanisms work there. We’ve already seen tremendous developments especially in kidney and bladder cancers over the last several years specifically with immunotherapy in earlier treatment settings. It’s truly transformative work.

Q: What do upcoming data to be presented at ESMO 2023 mean for patients with GU cancers?

Dr. Walker: I think ESMO is going to be very insightful this year. In addition to sharing our own data in GU cancers specifically in bladder cancer we’re excited to see what others have to share as well.

At BMS we’re looking forward to presenting new results in patients with unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma at ESMO especially in subgroups with high unmet needs.

Q: Where do you think the field of GU cancer research is headed?

Dr. Walker: We’re continuing to refine the way we treat the patients with the highest unmet needs and create a better understanding of those needs. We have been treating patients with GU cancers pretty homogenously and I think we need to continue to improve our knowledge of the tumor biology so that we can get more granular with our treatments and ensure we’re reaching more patients in need. Whether that’s through genomic profiling biomarkers or examining other correlative data from previous studies to see how we can apply it to new assets or new targets or other groundbreaking data that comes out over the next few months to years we’re excited to learn more and better understand how we can serve more patients.

Bristol Myers Squibb (BMS) launched a DTC campaign for Sotyktu (deucravacitinib) during the Grammy Awards Sunday night.

The one-minute ad supports the Found It campaign for Sotyktu a treatment for adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. It’s a common immune affliction that causes rashes and itchy dry patches of skin and affects more than 8 million Americans according to the National Psoriasis Foundation.

Airing before a national audience totaling in the millions during the annual music industry awards show Found It seeks to educate adults on the oral treatment option for plaque psoriasis through a combination of messaging that highlights body-positivity and incorporates casual humor.

The ad features two people a man on vacation and a businesswoman gearing up for a conference presentation who both feel empowered by the clear skin relief offered from Sotyktu. The ad encourages patients to “find what plaque psoriasis has been hiding from you.”

Sotyktu is the latest clinical offering in the plaque psoriasis space. The drug received approval from the Food and Drug Administration in September based on the results of a Phase III trial that showed the once-daily drug had higher efficacy compared to the placebo and rival twice-daily Otezla.

In a press release at the time of the decision BMS chief medical officer Samit Hirawat MD called Sotyktu the first oral plaque psoriasis treatment approved in nearly 10 years an “extraordinary achievement” that “is a breakthrough in the treatment of patients with this condition.”

Despite airing during the Grammys the Found It ad comes amid renewed skepticism about the effectiveness of linear TV and connected TV ads for new drugs. A recent study published in JAMA found that almost 70% of new drugs marketed on TV don’t have “high therapeutic value” compared to existing treatments.

Additionally the ad debuted days after BMS reported a revenue miss in Q4 2022 with revenues down by about $500 million year-over-year. Looking ahead BMS projects its total revenues will increase by about 2% with Revlimid driving revenue of $6.5 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vY2Euc3R5bGUueWFob28uY29tL3N0eWxlL2JyaXN0b2wtbXllcnMtc3F1aWJiLWZ1bGwtMjAyMi0xMjE0MzE0OTcuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bristol-Myers Squibb Full Year 2022 Earnings: In Line With Expectations,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='ca.style.yahoo.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /style/bristol-myers-squibb-full-2022-121431497.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025625649B70>, 'Connection to ca.style.yahoo.com timed out.

Red Bull announced in the build-up to the Miami Grand Prix that Newey would leave the team early next year calling time on his 19-year tenure as Red Bull’s design chief.

‘Are you sure you’re going to say no when he knocks on the door?’

Amassing 12 titles with the Milton Keynes squad Newey’s tally for both the Drivers’ and Constructors’ titles sits at 25 with a list that includes McLaren’s last championship successes.

Newey won the double with McLaren and Mika Hakkinen in 1998 and retained the Drivers’ Championship the following season.

But despite his cars winning championships at Williams McLaren and Red Bull McLaren CEO Brown says he has no interest in signing the 65-year-old.

Speaking to Sky Sports in the wake of Newey’s announcement Brown declared: “Our plans are to keep doing what we are doing I’m really happy with everything that Andrea [Stella] the whole technical team are doing.”

He doubled down on that in the Beyond the Grid Podcast saying: “We’re very happy with what we have.

“Obviously he’s the most successful designer of all time. It’s fascinating that he’s left but let’s see what he does.”

Dutch pundit Mol calls bull on that.

“I think that’s such bullshit” he told Ziggo Sport’s Race Café.

“Are you sure you’re going to say no when he knocks on the door? What team would say if Newey knocked on the door ‘No don’t do that!’ That’s not going to happen.”

‘He’s not going to Ferrari I’ll stick my hand up for that’

As for what’s next for Newey that’s been the hot debate since the Miami announcement with reports claiming Ferrari are leading the running to sign the design guru.

He’s reportedly had at least one talk with a representative of the Scuderia with Sky’s Craig Slater claiming those who know the Briton say it is a “genuine” possibility.

Mol though reckons retirement is the most likely option for the “tired” designer. “He’s not going to Ferrari anyway I’ll stick my hand up for that” he continued.

“I think he’s totally in the clear if you see what he says. You can only take his word for it with Ferrari. He really isn’t going to Ferrari to be very busy again and travel around the world 24 weekends a year.”

When the Ferrari rumours were put to Newey he said while he is “flattered” that 2025 Ferrari signing Lewis Hamilton wants to work with him for now he has no plans for his future.

“I think Mandy my wife and the dogs we’ll probably go travelling we’ll probably get a motorhome or something go down through France and just enjoy life” he said.

“And then maybe at some point I don’t know when I’ll be standing in the shower and say ‘Right this is going to be the next adventure’. But right now there is no plan.”

At the peak of his playing days Brown carved out a reputation as one of the best in the business; helping the Tampa Bay Buccaneers win the Super Bowl in 2021 and making it to the Pro Bowl on seven occasions while also being named a First-team All-Pro four times.

His story off the field however paints an entirely contrasting picture of the wideout from Miami - and a far less impressive one.

Long before officially hanging up his cleats for the first time last year Brown was involved in countless scrapes with the law. From tossing his furniture out of a 14th-floor apartment window and nearly hitting a 22-month-old toddler in the process to allegations of sexual assault trouble has seemed to follow him at every turn.

Those legal problems have continued since his infamous football farewell at the New York Jets in January 2022 when he walked out on the Bucs midway through their game at MetLife Stadium after a sideline spat with his coaches and never returned to the field again.

New Indiana Fever recruit Caitlin Clark has become the latest target of Brown's online vitriol

He recently sparked controversy by claiming the former college basketball star is 'hairy'

Yet despite his successful career before that bitter finale and the personal issues which have since followed these days Brown is best known for being the outspoken unusual and vile online troll with a history of upsetting and provoking people seemingly out of nowhere.

Over the past month Caitlin Clark has emerged as the latest victim of his distasteful vitriol on X formerly Twitter. The former Iowa college basketball superstar and new Indiana Fever recruit was forced to block Brown on the platform in April after he cruelly mocked her for being 'hairy' with a series of hateful comments and memes.

'Can't be cancelled if you already cancelled' he wrote afterwards.

And if that wasn't enough this week he took aim at Clark once more in an interview with Jason Whitlock despite initially attempting to patch things up.

After heaping praise on the 22-year-old Brown added: 'So shout out to you Caitlin Clark... and if it's hairy don't worry about it.'

It is the latest shameful outburst from an ex-player with a track record of bizarre needless and unpleasant attacks on innocent targets.

Even Brown's former teammates have not been immune to his antics over the years; even a quarterback universally considered as the greatest of all time.

When rumors of Tom Brady's marriage to Gisele Bundchen being on the rocks first surfaced in 2022 Brown sparked major controversy by taunting his former Patriots and Bucs colleague with mocked-up images of his now ex-wife.

He sparked major controversy by taunting his former Patriots and Bucs colleague with mocked-up images of his now ex-wife

Brady and Bundchen eventually announced their divorce amid the digs from Brown

After initially posting an old photo that shows himself and Bundchen hugging after a New England game he later shared an altered cover of the book 'Daddy Doesn't Live Here Anymore: A Book About Divorce' with Brady's face photoshopped onto one of the characters.

The cruel jibes later continued with a clearly photoshopped image of Brady's ex-wife on the body of another woman's naked body one where he added his face to a picture of Brady being hugged from behind by Bundchen.

Brady helped recruit Brown to the Bucs in 2020 and allowed for the former wide receiver to live with him before the start of the season. The iconic quarterback also vouched for him in 2019 to be brought onto the Patriots only for him to be released after just one game following allegations of sexual and personal misconduct.

The duo who won a Super Bowl together in 2021 saw their relationship deteriorate after Brown slammed Brady following his controversial exit from Tampa Bay.

In November 2022 the mercurial receiver created further controversy online when he shared a private message from his former teammate who ripped into him for being a 'young immature man'.

While it is unclear what prompted it the alleged message from Brady read: 'You are demonstrating very poor decisions and poor communication to so many people who have gone above and beyond to help you. You are acting selfish and unfortunately many of those people are exhausted by the erratic and unpredictable emotional behavior.

'When I met you you were humble willing to learn and anxious to improve things in your life. In a short period of time you have done those things and accomplished some great things. And very much on the path to success long term.

A year before his taunting Brown claims to have received this text message from Brady

'Unfortunately you have reverted very much back to a young immature man that is selfish self serving irrational and irresponsible.'

As far as sharing private details goes posting a screenshot of Brady's message is merely the tip of the iceberg in Brown's case.

Back in 2022 Brown had his Snapchat account suspended and found himself under investigation after sharing an explicit photo of Chelsie Kyriss - the mother of his children.

The controversial former NFL star took things way too far when sharing a photo of a Kyriss performing oral sex in bed. The post was claimed to have been deleted prior to a report that Snapchat suspended his account.

'I have reported his page and all pictures' Kyriss claimed to TMZ at the time. 'Unfortunately Snapchat is allowing him to repost. I am very sorry for any of your kids that follow him and used to look at him as a role model.

'I do not condone these actions as you are aware I have kids involved as well.'

Kyriss is the mother of four of Brown's children.

Rather than offer up and apology or try to avoid social media altogether following the episode Brown took to Twitter (X) to share his thoughts describing himself as 'somewhere between psy.chot.ic and i.con.ic'.

Back in 2022 Brown also had his Snapchat account suspended and found himself under investigation after sharing an explicit photo of Chelsie Kyriss (left) - the mother of his children

After the image emerged Brown took to his Twitter page telling people not to 'play' with him

In two follow up tweets he added 'what more Can I SAY NOW?'

The other read: 'Don't play wit [sic] me Play Football.'

Kyriss is not the only baby mom Brown has caused upset to over the years nevertheless.

The Super-Bowl winner has also endured a long-running dispute with Wiltrice Jackson - the mother of his 15-year-old daughter Antanyiah - over a $15000 child-support payment.

Brown was arrested last October for allegedly neglecting to pay child support to Jackson before being released a few days later on a $15000 bond and then doling out the same sum to the mother of his daughter shortly after leaving jail.

However she had claimed that he owed her almost $31000 when urging police to follow through with his arrest.

One week after making the $15000 payment to Jackson Brown took shots at his former partner by posting a cartoon online which appeared to show him running away from a woman as she tries to take dollar bills from him.

One week after finally making the $15000 payment to Jackson Brown took shots at his former partner by posting this cartoon online

In the cartoon onlookers could be seen watching on in shock as Brown wearing a No 87 Pittsburgh Steelers jersey attempts to get away from the woman.

He captioned the post on X: 'F*** Child Support………………..'

Despite the controversy and hurt he has caused online Brown still appears to have an admirer in Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.

Kelce whose profile has skyrocketed over the past year amid his relationship with Taylor Swift surprisingly claimed the troubled ex-football player is one of his favorite people to follow on social media earlier this year.

During the Chiefs' AFC Championship win over the Baltimore Ravens Kelce broke Jerry Rice's record for most postseason receptions in NFL history prompting Brown to hail him as one of the 'dopest crackers' he knows on X.

Kelce's brother Jason claimed Brown's post was 'probably the biggest compliment' during an episode of their New Heights podcast.

Despite the controversy and hurt he has caused he is one of Travis Kelce's 'favorite' follows

And the ex-Bucs and Patriots wideout's toxic behavior is unlikely to slow down anytime soon

'I appreciate you AB man. Feels good to be one of the dopest crackers' Travis replied while laughing. 'I love that s***. He's one of my favorite follows on twitter you've got to follow him.'

Kelce's endorsement of Brown raises eyebrows given the manner he has conducted himself in recent years with Caitlin Clark currently the subject of his most foul online tirades.

And following his short-lived attempt to clear the air with the Indiana Fever star that toxic online behavior is unlikely to slow down anytime soon.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL3dpZG93LWJyb3duLXMtZGFuYnVyeS1uZXctb3duZXItZmFjZWxpZnQtMTk0NTEyNzEucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New owner taking over Danbury's Widow Brown's roadhouse plans 'lovely facelift',ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.newstimes.com/news/article/widow-brown-s-danbury-new-owner-facelift-19451271.php on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3N0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlL3dpZG93LWJyb3duLXMtZGFuYnVyeS1uZXctb3duZXItZmFjZWxpZnQtMTk0NTEyNzEucGhw0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL2hvbWVuZXdzL2FkbWluaXN0cmF0aW9uLzQ2NTk0MTgtYmlkZW4tdG8tbWVldC13aXRoLWJyb3duLXYtYm9hcmQtcGxhaW50aWZmcy1kdXJpbmctd2Vlay1vZi1lbmdhZ2VtZW50LXdpdGgtYmxhY2stY29tbXVuaXR5L9IBkwFodHRwczovL3RoZWhpbGwuY29tL2hvbWVuZXdzL2FkbWluaXN0cmF0aW9uLzQ2NTk0MTgtYmlkZW4tdG8tbWVldC13aXRoLWJyb3duLXYtYm9hcmQtcGxhaW50aWZmcy1kdXJpbmctd2Vlay1vZi1lbmdhZ2VtZW50LXdpdGgtYmxhY2stY29tbXVuaXR5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biden to meet with Brown v.

Thousands of brown pelicans are starving to death and scientists don't seem to know why. Now one local rescue center is desperately appealing to the public for help.

On Saturday a public open house at the International Bird Rescue Center in Fairfield almost didn't happen but they decided to go through with it anyway because they thought it was important for the public to understand the crisis they're dealing with. The rescue center is accustomed to dealing with injured or sick birds but what began slowly in April has suddenly become overwhelming.

""We were all going back and forth like 'Is this a thing is this not a thing?' And then in the last four or five days things have just cratered"" said the center's fevelopment director Alex Domeyko. ""The number of pelicans we've taken in in the last week or so has doubled.""

""For the first time in ten years this is the most pelicans I've ever seen here so it's quite unusual"" said wildlife center manager Kelly Beffa.

Brown pelicans are the birds you see at the beach skimming over the water in formation like a squadron of fighter planes. Lately they've been found wandering in unusual places unable to fly away from people.

""One bird that we actually have in care right now came in from Santa Cruz and it tried to walk into a bar right near the boardwalk. So these birds are disoriented"" said spokesperson Russ Curtis.

They're not sick they're starving. For some reason that remains a mystery the birds cannot find the fish they need to survive. They eat the same diet as other birds but it is only the pelicans that are being brought in by the dozens.

""One of the things that we'll be relying on is ocean scientists and avian folks to figure out why this fishing stock is eluding them"" Curtis said.

""Some of them are coming in less than half of the body weight that they're supposed to be"" said Beffa as she examined a new arrival. ""So imagine a human going through that. You're supposed to weigh 150 pounds you're coming in at 75 pounds. You're going to be having some severe problems.""

The rescue center currently has 120 pelicans and is expecting another 30 to 40 in a few days. As a result the operation is facing a crisis of its own.

""Right now we're going through 500 pounds of fish a day"" said Curtis. ""That's about $1000 a day so you can start to multiply that out.""

The birds respond well to the food and vitamins they're getting but they can't be released into the wild until there is a food supply for them. It's putting a major drain on the center's finances so they're asking for help -- donations to help pay for food and volunteers to help care for so many patients.

""I mean especially for crises like this where we take in this many birds we need as many hands on deck as we can get"" Domeyko said. ""And volunteers are the backbone of this organization.""

No one knows for sure why this is happening or when it might end. Pelicans burn a lot of calories and can die within days with no food. The fear is for each of the birds that have been captured and saved many more have already perished in the wild.

The center says any pelican found acting strangely should be reported immediately to local animal control. For information about donating or volunteering visit the International Bird Rescue website."

The effort doesn’t involve Las Vegas.

In the past month Las Vegas Sands has been linked to potential gaming development opportunities in the New York City area and Texas. The company is willing to spend billions of dollars in both locations to regain its American foothold.

Sands is among several Strip and regional gaming operators seeking one of three licenses that would place a multi-billion-dollar casino resort near the nation’s most populous city and within the largest metropolitan region in the U.S. Most analysts believe two of the licenses are already spoken for leaving a high-stakes battle for one lucrative opportunity to locate within reach of more than 20 million people in southern New York and northern New Jersey.

Meanwhile the company has committed to spending millions of dollars to push casino legislation in Texas one of the largest states without regulated commercial casinos or legal sports betting. Sands is the primary financial backer of the Texas Destination Resort Alliance (TDRA) a grassroots coalition that is asking lawmakers to allow Texans to vote on a statewide constitutional amendment authorizing the development of destination resorts in Texas’ major cities.

Victory is not guaranteed in either state.

“Las Vegas Sands is amongst a long list of interested suitors for the one downstate (New York) license a license award that we believe is tough to handicap given the politics involved” Deutsche Bank gaming analyst Carlo Santarelli wrote in a research note following the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call in January.

“The commentary was brief (but) Las Vegas Sands reinforced their focus on geographical expansion with Asia and large-scale domestic opportunities remaining the sole focus” Santarelli added.

Gaming industry adviser Brendan Bussmann said both New York City and Texas have been on the radar of Sands and other major casino operators for more than two decades. He said Sands “has been the one company that has remained committed to getting Texas across the finish line.”

Bussmann the managing partner of Las Vegas-based B2 Global said Sands has “carried the water while others continue to stay on the sideline on the destination resort issue.”

Following last year’s $6.25 billion sale of The Venetian The Palazzo and The Venetian Expo Sands focused on its five Macau resorts and Singapore’s Marina Bay Sands which combined for $4.1 billion in revenue in 2022 — a 3 percent drop from 2021.

Las Vegas Sands committed to spending $3 billion over the next four years to renovate and expand its flagship Singapore property. The company expects to spend roughly $1.4 billion in Macau through 2024 on capital improvements at its properties and its commitments associated with a recent 10-year gaming concession renewal from the Macau government.

At the end of 2022 Sands had available cash of $6.31 billion and access to $2.48 billion in financing. However the company had $15.95 billion in long-term debt. Sands which has maintained its corporate headquarters in Las Vegas has long coveted Texas and New York City.

“For us we're very focused on return on invested capital” Sands President Patrick Dumont said in January during the company’s fourth-quarter conference call in response to an analyst’s question about New York.

“In every market that we're in we're typically the largest trade partner with the small and medium enterprises” Dumont said. “We're looking to develop deep community routes so we can support the community and really show this industry is something that can benefit everyone.”

Longing for New York City

Sands – which has dropped the Las Vegas name from much of its corporate presence even though the company’s stock is still traded under the LVS symbol – has traveled both of these casino expansion paths before.

Company founder Sheldon Adelson who died in January 2021 hired high-profile lobbyists in a failed effort to launch a New York City casino approval process years ahead of the 2023 timeline mandated by the state. Adelson wanted to build a resort next to the Javits Center one of the busiest convention centers in the United States.

However that site was claimed last year by Wynn Resorts which announced a partnership with New York-based Related Companies to seek a gaming license for Western Yards at Hudson Yards.

In January Sands announced plans to seek approval for a casino resort on Long Island which is in Nassau County roughly 36 miles east of Manhattan. The 80-acre site houses the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum the former home of the NHL’s New York Islanders.

“This is not a regional casino” Las Vegas Sands Chairman and CEO Rob Goldstein said during the company’s conference call when he casually referenced a $4 billion to $5 billion cost for development and construction.

“This is a full-blown resort with [meetings incentives conferences and exhibitions] entertainment retail (and) restaurants” Goldstein said. “It's the real thing. It's not meant to be a small-time investment.”

Stifel Financial gaming analyst Steven Wieczynski remarked on Sands’ optimism in a research note saying the process would be ultra-competitive.

“We think an integrated resort in New York would represent an attractive way for Las Vegas Sands to re-enter the U.S. market and deploy the proceeds from its Las Vegas Strip asset sale” Wieczynski wrote.

Goldstein said New York’s potential casino business would be a unique opportunity for the company given the region’s size and scope. With two other casinos targeting Manhattan and the surrounding communities he suggested all three casinos could be profitable.

“We’re going all the way in and building something transformational that drives tourism” Goldstein said.

In addition to Wynn and Sands Caesars Entertainment offered a casino proposal for Times Square with developer SL Green Realty Corp. Oklahoma’s Chickasaw Nation is part of an effort on Coney Island and Florida’s Seminole Indian Tribe through its ownership of Hard Rock Entertainment is reportedly in talks with New York Mets owner Steve Cohen for a casino on Willets Point near the team’s stadium.

Most analysts expect two of the licenses will go to MGM Resorts International and Resorts World which already operate New York City-area casino facilities at two horse racing tracks. The casinos only offer slot machine-like video lottery terminals.

Macquarie Securities gaming analyst Chad Beynon said he considers Sands “to be a serious contender for a New York casino license given its track record in (convention and meetings business) and non-gaming (history).”

New York may take much of 2023 to sort out the licensing process.

Another attempt to lasso Texas

It’s unclear what will happen in the Texas Legislature this year. A bill supported by the TDRA and filed in January requires voter approval in November to allow one Las Vegas-style casino resort in each of the state’s four major metropolitan markets – Houston Austin Dallas-Fort Worth and San Antonio.

Limited gaming would be allowed at racetracks while Indian tribes with electronic bingo facilities could add slot machines and other forms of gaming if voters approve the referendum.

In the last 10 years Sands-backed casino expansion efforts have failed to win support. Texas lawmakers meet for 140 days every two years.

“Gambling legalization in Texas is still far from a foregone conclusion” Wieczynski wrote in a research note. “The situation will likely take time to play out given competing interests and bureaucratic red tape in the jurisdiction.”

Casino proponents are also armed with a study undertaken by the University of Houston’s Hobby School of Public Affairs that found 75 percent of Texans support casino legislation.

“Texas has historically had strict laws regulating most forms of gaming even as neighboring states have expanded opportunities for casino gambling” said Renée Cross senior executive director and researcher at the Hobby School referring to commercial casinos in Louisiana and tribal casinos in Oklahoma.

“Opponents have historically had powerful allies in the Legislature but we found the public appears ready to back major changes in how Texas regulates gambling” Cross said.

Researchers found Democrats were more likely to favor expanded gambling than Republicans but support cuts across racial ethnic partisan religious and generational lines.

“It’s not just that a majority of Texans support expanded gambling. We found a majority of people in urban suburban and rural areas support it” said Mark Jones senior research fellow at the Hobby School and political science fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.

Bussmann suggested the positive polling results may sway lawmakers.

“This is the biggest opportunity for investment and jobs in the Texas market that continues to grow as the state sees an influx of people moving from other states” Bussmann said.

Sands executives have avoided commenting publicly on Texas but the company hasn’t shied away from financially backing the effort.

According to the Dallas Morning News in 2021 Sands hired 76 lobbyists at a cost of $6.7 million. As of the first week of the 2023 legislative session Sands had brought on 63 lobbyists with a mandate to spend up to $5.9 million. The newspaper cited data from the Texas Ethics Commission.

The roadblock in Texas is Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick a conservative Republican and staunch anti-gaming opponent.

However Republican Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott both expressed openness to casino expansion at various times in 2021.

“If there is a way to create a very professional entertainment option for Texans Gov. Abbott would take a look at it” an Abbott spokesperson said in a statement to The Texas Tribune last year.

Phelan whose district borders Louisiana said in January he opposes slot machines in convenience stores but thought casinos can be “high quality” destinations “that create jobs and that improve the lifestyle of those communities.”

Sands formed a political action committee Texas Sands PAC that contributed $2.2 million to statewide officials and dozens of lawmakers from both parties during the 2022 campaign.

The PAC has been almost entirely funded by Adelson’s widow Miriam Adelson who became the company’s 58 percent majority shareholder after her husband died. Abbott received $200000 from the Sands PAC and an additional $1 million donation from Miriam Adelson personally.

Texas is surrounded by legal gaming including tribal casinos in Oklahoma that draw customers from the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Louisiana where casinos along Interstate 10 see business from Houston.

“We’re monitoring the situation in Texas given our presence in Louisiana” said Boyd Gaming CEO Keith Smith whose company operates five casinos in the neighboring state.

Texas is the No. 2 feeder market to Las Vegas behind California in terms of airline passengers according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. In 2021 the state accounted for almost 1.9 million arriving airline passengers 1 million behind California.

Sands won’t be alone in Texas — MGM Resorts hired lobbyists for the session. Most analysts predict Houston billionaire Tilman Fertitta who owns the five Golden Nugget casinos in Las Vegas Laughlin Atlantic City Louisiana and Mississippi won’t stay on the sidelines.

Last summer Caesars Entertainment CEO Tom Reeg said the casino giant would “look for a way to participate” if a major market “like Texas” were to open up.

Penn Entertainment owns racetracks near San Antonio and Houston and has lobbyists in Texas.

CEO Jay Snowden said this week he has spent time in Texas and having lobbyists watching “sets us up really well if and when something does happen. We believe (Texas) could be a real significant opportunity and exciting one for the company.”

Texans could also see a referendum on legalizing mobile sports betting. The Texas Sports Betting Alliance was formed as a coalition of professional sports teams and sports betting companies – including DraftKings and FanDuel. The group hired former Gov. Rick Perry as spokesman.

“It’s going on it’s gonna continue to go on and the state of Texas needs to regulate it and make sure that its citizens’ information is protected” Perry told The Texas Tribune.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhcGVybWFnLmNvbS9hZGVsZS1yaWhhbm5hLXN1cGVyLWJvd2zSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Adele Says She's Attending the Super Bowl 'Just for Rihanna',"Adele will be attending America's most popular sporting event — if only to see the halftime performer.

If you want to see more best January dividend stocks to buy go directly to 5 Best January Dividend Stocks to Buy.

While January might be over many dividend stocks aren't done paying their dividends for 2023.

Considering many dividend stocks pay dividends quarterly many of the same companies that paid a dividend in January will pay another dividend in April.

If the company has the profits or the financial resources to do so some of those companies might even raise their quarterly dividends during that time. Some of the same companies could also buy back stock as another form of return of excess capital in the mean time too.

Good dividend stocks are not necessarily the ones that have a lot of upside as many stocks that have a lot of upside also have a lot of downside. In terms of January the S&P 500 rallied 6.6% for the month as fourth quarter U.S. GDP was slightly stronger than expected and as the Federal Reserve indicated that the ""disinflationary process has started"" after 2022's substantial interest rate increases.

While macroeconomic conditions are looking better than they did before economic data can always miss estimates. If inflation increases more than expected growth slows more than expected the Federal Reserve tightens more than expected or a number of other things the market could always decline and individual stocks could always decline.

Instead good dividend stocks have relatively more stability substantial competitive advantages and considerable normalized earnings power. With competitive advantages and substantial normalized earnings power those companies are more likely to maintain or even increase their dividends over time if they maintain their market shares. While the best dividend stocks also have downside the hope is that those companies' strong competitive advantages and dividend returns will limit the downside in the long term.

Given 2023 could also be a volatile year it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of leading stocks across many different sectors.

Methodology

For our list of 10 Best January Dividend Stocks to Buy we took all the stocks that had ex-dividend dates in January and filtered for only leading consumer staples stocks with substantial competitive advantages or leading companies with considerable scale.

We then ranked each stock based on the number of hedge funds in our database that held shares of the same stock at the end of the third quarter.

Story continues

In terms of record date and ex-dividend dates Investor.gov writes

""When a company declares a dividend it sets a record date when you must be on the company's books as a shareholder to receive the dividend. Companies also use this date to determine who is sent proxy statements financial reports and other information. Once the company sets the record date the ex-dividend date is set based on stock exchange rules. The ex-dividend date for stocks is usually set one business day before the record date. If you purchase a stock on its ex-dividend date or after you will not receive the next dividend payment. Instead the seller gets the dividend. If you purchase before the ex-dividend date you get the dividend.""

Every company is different so investors should always check to see company specific circumstances for every dividend payment.

The Aeroplan® Credit Card (review) has a perk that’s potentially more lucrative than first meets the eye…

Chase Aeroplan Card Pay Yourself Back basics

With the Aeroplan Credit Card‘s Pay Yourself Back feature cardmembers can redeem their Aeroplan points for 1.25 cents each toward any purchase in the travel category. That’s right — it’s now possible for cardholders to redeem their Aeroplan points for everything from Spirit Airlines flights to Four Seasons hotel stays.

Redeem Aeroplan points for a Four Seasons hotel stay

To cover some of the basic terms associated with this:

You can charge any eligible travel purchase to your Aeroplan Credit Card and then reimburse yourself for that purchase within 90 days from the redemption date

There’s no cap to how many Aeroplan points can be redeemed this way in 2023 while as of 2024 you’ll be restricted to redeeming 50000 points per year

Statement credits will post to your account within three business days and will appear on your credit card billing statement within one to two billing cycles

Eligible travel purchases include airlines hotels motels timeshares car rental agencies cruise lines travel agencies discount travel sites campgrounds passenger trains buses taxis limousines ferries toll bridges and highways and parking lots and garages

Below you can see some screenshots of the process of using the Pay Yourself Back feature (sadly this isn’t my account… I don’t have that many Aeroplan points!). When you’re logged into your Chase account you can just click the “Pay Yourself Back” button.

Then you can select from eligible transactions to decide which you want to redeem points for.

You’ll then be given the option of how many points you want to redeem. You can apply points toward all or part of the purchase cost assuming you have enough points.

And then you’ll receive confirmation that you’ve initiated the Pay Yourself Back feature and a statement credit will soon appear on your account.

Aeroplan Chase Pay Yourself Back feature

Can all Aeroplan points be redeemed with Pay Yourself Back?

The Chase Aeroplan Pay Yourself Back Feature feature is exclusively available for those with the Aeroplan Credit Card. One common question however is which Aeroplan points cardmembers can redeem through the Pay Yourself Back feature. After all Aeroplan is transfer partners with Amex Membership Rewards Capital One and Chase Ultimate Rewards.

Do the points have to be earned with the Aeroplan Credit Card or can you convert points from other currencies and then redeem them this way? I’ve asked Aeroplan contacts about this and the intention is that this feature be used for points earned with Chase:

This means you can not only redeem points earned with your Aeroplan Credit Card but you can also redeem points transferred from Chase Ultimate Rewards to Aeroplan this way

However the intention isn’t that points transferred over from Amex Membership Rewards and Capital One be redeemed this way

Now practically speaking it’s not like your Aeroplan points balance is broken down into your points acquired through Chase and your points not acquired through Chase. My interpretation would be that some mixing of points is fine like if you have a small balance of points through other means as long as you’re acting within the spirit of the program.

So I imagine if you transfer a million points from Amex to Aeroplan and then use those points for Pay Yourself Back you may be in trouble. Meanwhile if you have 500000 Aeroplan points and a small percentage of those were earned through non-Chase means I can’t imagine that would be an issue. Again that’s just my interpretation. I always recommend acting within the spirit of these programs or else you might find yourself in a bad situation.

Redeem Aeroplan points for a JetBlue Mint flight

Why the Aeroplan Pay Yourself Back Feature is valuable

Should everyone with the Aeroplan Credit Card redeem their points using the Pay Yourself Back feature? No absolutely not. But I think this is also much more lucrative than first meets the eye.

Aeroplan is my favorite frequent flyer program and personally I value Aeroplan points at 1.5 cents each thanks to all the amazing ways there are to redeem Aeroplan points. Aeroplan has dozens of airline partners and on top of that allows stopovers for just 5000 extra points. Aeroplan points give you incredible potential to redeem for first & business class flights.

However this Pay Yourself Back feature gives you an impressive amount of flexibility with your Chase Ultimate Rewards points. So if you have a card like the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card (review) you should now seriously consider picking up the Aeroplan Credit Card.

The first thing to keep in mind is that for 2023 those with the Aeroplan Credit Card receive a 10% transfer bonus from Chase Ultimate Rewards. This applies when you transfer 50000 or more Chase Ultimate Rewards points in one transaction and you can get a maximum of 25000 points this way for 2023 (which you’d get when transferring 250000 points).

So why is this so awesome?

You could get up to 1.375 cents per Chase Ultimate Rewards point if you’re a cardmember

This is potentially more advantageous than redeeming through the Chase Travel Portal since you can truly book however you’d like; you can book your hotel stay directly with your preferred hotel so you can take advantage of loyalty perks you can book a ticket on Southwest (which isn’t available through the Chase Travel Portal) and you can even book a hotel rate with your preferred corporate rate code

While the Chase Sapphire Reserve® Card (review) allows redemptions for 1.5 cents each through the Chase Travel Portal personally I’d rather redeem points for 1.25-1.375 cents each and be able to book how I’d like given all the additional opportunities that opens up

Being able to cash out Chase points for 1.25-1.375 cents each without any sort of a booking requirement is quite worthwhile. It’s especially useful for those who want flexibility and who struggle to maximize points in the traditional way.

The Aeroplan Credit Card is worth another look

If you don’t yet have the Aeroplan Credit Card I think this card is seriously worth considering:

The card offers a welcome bonus of 60000 points after you spend $3000 on purchases in the first 3 months your account is open.

With the Pay Yourself Back feature the full bonus will get you $750 worth of travel of your choice with hotels flights rental cars etc.

This in my opinion the most innovative co-brand airline card we’ve seen in terms of the rewards structure the spending bonuses the ability to earn status and the general perks

Even if you’re not huge into Aeroplan I think most would agree that being able to now redeem these rewards to erase virtually any travel purchase is a phenomenal opportunity.

Bottom line

The Aeroplan Credit Card has a valuable Pay Yourself Back feature. Cardmembers can redeem Aeroplan points for 1.25 cents each toward almost any travel purchase by using their points to erase the cost of that purchase. While savvy travelers can get well over 1.25 cents of value per Aeroplan point I think this is a pretty exciting option for the Chase Ultimate Rewards ecosystem overall.

Do you see value in the Aeroplan Credit Card/s Pay Yourself Back feature?"

Either as a trade-in or from a car auction where used vehicle models strut their stuff up and down the runway.

The auction business has traditionally been hands-on and in person. But Covid-19 changed all that and the need to deploy technology that can streamline buying a car at a Mannheim or Adesa auction virtually has only grown.

Israeli startup UVeye has developed an AI-enhanced inspection technology for the automotive business incorporating sensors and high-speed cameras. CarMax the largest retailer of used cars in the US has been a strategic investor in UVeye since 2021.

Now CarMax is implementing UVeye’s technology for its wholesale business operations. (During the fiscal year ended February 28 2022 CarMax sold approximately 706000 wholesale vehicles at its auctions which moved online in 2020.)

CarMax says it will be using UVeye vehicle scans “to check vehicle exteriors undercarriage components and tires to quickly produce online user-friendly reports that include high-resolution photos. Systems in use at CarMax also will have the ability to detect issues such as frame damage missing parts and fluid leaks as well as brake and exhaust-system problems.”

UVeye CEO Amir Hever commented that “it’s a true privilege to have CarMax on this journey with us both as an investor and as a strategic customer.”

Amir and Ohad Hever cofounded UVeye in 2016 to promote a fully automated drive-through approach to vehicle inspections of tires underbody components and exteriors in less than 12 seconds. The technology was originally developed for the security industry to detect weapons and contraband.

In addition to CarMax investors in UVeye include General Motors Toyota Volvo Hyundai and several Israeli venture capital firms. The company won an Automotive News 2022 All-Star Award.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The fair will run Wednesday through Sunday July 5-9 at the Great Bend Expo Complex with the carnival performing three nights Thursday Friday and Saturday.

The fair last had a carnival in 2019. However COVID-19 brought that to a grinding halt.

“Since the pandemic limited the number of carnivals available we have been working hard to try and secure this type of entertainment for the public” said Charles Atkinson association president “Working with other entities throughout the county we are blessed to be able to bring WEEE Entertainment to our county fair.”

“In November of 2022 WEEE Entertainment informed the Hoisington Chamber of Commerce that scheduling conflicts would keep them from bringing a carnival to our Annual Labor Day Celebration in September 2023” said Karen Baldyga Hoisington Chamber executive vice president. “Despite the disappointment of not having them at our event the Hoisington Chamber of Commerce is pleased that Barton County residents will still be able to enjoy the fun and excitement associated with a carnival while attending the Barton County Fair this summer.”

While attending the Kansas Fairs and Festivals Convention in Topeka last weekend association board members were able to meet with Chris Williams owner of WEEE Entertainment and work out the final details. According to Atkinson the carnival is going to bring in 17-18 rides for this year’s fair and they are very excited to come to the Barton County Fair for the first time.

“As they always have we hope the communities of Barton County will continue to come out and support the fair but this year we will be adding the lights and sounds of the carnival” Atkinson said.

He said this cooperation fits the fair’s theme for this year – “Country Pride – County Wide.”

CARR,Carrier Global,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZyZWlnaHR3YXZlcy5jb20vbmV3cy9sYWctZWZmZWN0LXdoeS1jb250YWluZXItbGluZS1wcm9maXRzLXN0YXktaGlnaC1sb25nZXItdGhhbi1zcG90LXJhdGVz0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZnJlaWdodHdhdmVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2xhZy1lZmZlY3Qtd2h5LWNvbnRhaW5lci1saW5lLXByb2ZpdHMtc3RheS1oaWdoLWxvbmdlci10aGFuLXNwb3QtcmF0ZXMvYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lag effect: Why liner profits stay high much longer than spot rates,"Spot container shipping rates in many trades have already collapsed back to pre-COVID levels. But container liner earnings are still nowhere near where they were pre-pandemic. Ocean carriers are still earning billions more per quarter than they used to.

German carrier Hapag-Lloyd reported earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization of $3.8 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. That’s over seven times EBITDA in Q4 2019 pre-COVID.

The Bloomberg consensus forecast is for Hapag-Lloyd to post EBITDA of $5.6 billion for full-year 2023 2.5 times EBITDA in 2019. Deutsche Bank thinks Hapag-Lloyd’s EBITDA will be $7.7 billion 3.5 times 2019 earnings.

Spot index data over the past decade shows just how extreme of an anomaly the COVID era actually was. Global spot rates averaged around $2000 per forty-foot equivalent unit in 2012-14. They fell to around $1300 per FEU in 2015-16 amid the Hanjin bankruptcy. They averaged around $1450 per FEU in 2017-19.

The pandemic era’s goods-buying spree propelled the global spot average to an unprecedented peak of over $10000 per FEU in late 2021. Global averages of the Drewry World Container Index (WCI) and Freightos Baltic Daily Index (FBX) are now back to around $2000 per FEU.

Most of the east-west spot rate indexes have now normalized. (The still-booming trans-Atlantic westbound trade from Europe to the U.S. is an exception.). The pace of descent flattened in December and January across most global trades. The cliff-like rate plunge seen in August-October has ended.

Trans-Atlantic strength is still keeping the global averages higher than in 2017-19 while in other lanes including Asia-West Coast spot rates are all the way back to pre-pandemic levels.

Fall in contract rates comes next

With spot rates having already plunged why are Hapag-Lloyd’s earnings still so much higher than pre-pandemic? One reason is the lag effect in revenue recognition. Depending on timing cargo booked in a particular month may not show up in a carrier’s revenue line until the following quarter.





But the main reason is that the majority of ocean carrier revenue is not booked on spot it’s booked on annual contracts and the decline in contract rates lags the decline in spot rates.

As industry expert John McCown has repeatedly emphasized: “Earnings in the container shipping industry are on a different curve than what has occurred with spot rates as the large majority of loads move under contract rates.”

Most annual Asia-Europe contracts reset on Jan. 1 and most annual Asia-U.S. contracts on May 1. In some cases carriers agreed to lower annual rates in the middle of last year’s contract — Zim (NYSE: ZIM) has acknowledged doing so — but only after spot rates fell well below contract rates.

Long-term rates are tracked by Norway’s Xeneta.

Whereas the global WCI and FBX spot rate indexes peaked in September 2021 Xeneta’s XSI long-term index didn’t peak until 11 months later in August 2022.

Index: 100=January 2017. (Chart: Xeneta)

The XSI fell moderately in the fourth quarter then registered its largest-ever month-on-month plunge — 13% — in January. Even so the XSI was still at 364 points last month 3.4 times higher than the 2017-19 average.

Hapag-Lloyd’s results confirm the central importance of contract rates. In Q4 2022 its average freight rate including both contract and spot was $5250 per FEU almost double the average FBX and WCI global spot index levels during that period.

The carrier’s Q4 2022 rates were 2% above rates in Q4 2021 a time when the supply chain crisis was peaking. They were 2.5 times Hapag-Lloyd’s average rate in Q4 2019 pre-COVID.





The carrier’s average rate fell 15% in Q4 2022 versus Q3 2022. That is a much more moderate drop than the average decline in the FBX global composite spot index which plunged 48% quarter on quarter.

Fall in earnings after fall in rates

The other reason carrier earnings are still nowhere near pre-COVID levels: Carrier bottom lines jumped much faster than rates during the COVID boom due to very high operating leverage.

Rising average freight rates multiplied by total volume drove revenues up much faster than costs (fuel container handling crewing chartering etc.). As a result profits still have a long way to fall.

Most carriers including Hapag-Lloyd didn’t see earnings peak until Q3 2022 a year after spot rates began falling.

Hapag-Lloyd’s EBITDA declined sharply in the fourth quarter versus the third down $1.9 billion or 33%. Yet it still came in $3.3 billion or 622% higher than EBITDA in Q4 2019.

(Chart: FreightWaves based on financial filings by Hapag-Lloyd)

The question ahead is how the lag effect will play out. Will the normalization of spot earnings be followed by the same normalization of contract rates and eventually carrier EBITDA and net income sinking back to pre-COVID levels or even below those levels?

Or will there be a surprise to the upside: no global recession sturdy U.S. consumer demand carrier capacity management offsetting newbuilding arrivals retailer inventory levels winding down and needing replenishment and volumes (and rates) edging back up during the next peak season?

“We think momentum in the space continues to be negative and therefore we remain cautious on the sector” Deutsche Bank analyst Andrew Chu wrote in a client note. “We forecast that container shipping profits will normalize quickly although it is hard to forecast numbers given the operating leverage in the business a macro slowdown and significant supply — plus-10% — coming into the market.”

The major concern about the aged ship’s sinking is the presence of at least nine tons of asbestos in the hull along with smaller quantities of other undesirable substances such as oil and chemical coatings. The sinking of the ship would deposit these toxic substances in the ocean leading to a major environmental catastrophe.

A Turkish shipyard had previously bought the hull and had planned to dismantle it. However facing complaints from environmental groups about the asbestos Turkey revoked authorisation for the ship to enter its waters. The ship is currently sailing on tow off the coast of Brazil.

In January this year the navy observed a “critical increase in the degradation of the safety of the hull” increasing the navy’s urgency to “deal with” the situation.

A cold war era relic

The NAe Sao Paulo was a Clemenceau-class aircraft carrier in service with the Brazilian Navy. First commissioned in 1963 by the French navy as Foch it remained in service with France till 2000 when it was transferred to Brazil becoming its flagship.

However already past its prime the ship’s time with the Brazilian navy was marred with various issues with the carrier requiring frequent maintenance and suffering from many breakdowns. Finally in 2017 as it became increasingly less viable to operate the Sao Paulo Brazil decided to decommission the ship.

The ship used the CATOBAR system (also used by US’s Nimitz class carriers) and had a 870 feet long flight deck with the capacity to carry 22 jets and 27 helicopters. It weighs over 32000 tons.

Asbestos used as an insulator

Asbestos has been used on ships as both a fire retardant and an insulator to protect sailors from the constant and jarring vibrations of ships’ engines. According to NGO Shipbreaking Platform despite being banned from ships since 2002 recent estimates indicate that asbestos is “still found in over 65 per cent of vessels including 50 per cent of all new builds.”

Today it is known to be a highly toxic material and a carcinogen. Inhaled or swallowed asbestos fibers can become trapped in the respiratory or digestive systems of the body accumulating over time. Studies have shown that repeated exposure can cause inflammation and damage the DNA. The following illnesses have been associated with asbestos exposure: lung cancer COPD mesothelioma and asbestosis.

According to Shipbreaking Platform’s study on another Clememnceau-class carrier the ship contained nearly 760 tons of asbestos an amount far higher than the nine tons Brazil claimed the Sao Paulo contained.

A problem for the ship breaking industry

Over the years the shipbreaking industry particularly in the Global South has been affected by asbestos-related illnesses. For instance In 2017 a study seeking to map asbestosis among shipbreaking workers in Bangladesh identified that from a group of 94 workers 35 per cent were suffering from asbestosis.

This has led to the recycling of old ships becoming a health and environment issue as well as a matter of North-South equity. Often ship recycling yards in the Global South where regulations have been lax and systems corrupt take on the work of scrapping old ships that would both be more expensive and harder to do in the West.

Finding no takers for scrapping the ship

The Brazilian navy planned for the ship’s “green dismantling” after it was decommissioned reported Folha de S.Paulo. After it was stripped of many of its systems in 2021 the ship’s hull was sold to a Turkish company Sok Shipping accredited and certified to carry out safe recycling. In August 2022 the ship set sail on tow for Turkey from Rio de Janeiro.

Things however would not go as planned. In the face of protests from environmental groups such as Greenpeace and Shipbreaking Platform the Turkish government revoked the ship’s permission to enter its territorial waters making it turn back from the Straits of Gibraltar.

Since then the ship has been tugged around international waters off the coast of Brazil. Brazilian ports have refused to provide Sao Paulo harbour while protests around the environmental risks that the ship poses have continued.

Not easy to recycle old aircraft carriers

Ship-recyclers at Gujarat’s Alang one of the largest ship-recycling yards in the world said they had not tried to purchase the carrier. “Warships require special clearances from the Government of India for beaching in Alang and one has to follow a rather lengthy process to obtain them. Therefore no one from Alang tried to purchase that ship to the best of my knowledge” Haresh Parmar secretary of Ship Recycling Industries Association (SRIA) the Bhavnagar-based chamber of ship-recyclers at Alang told The Indian Express.

Alang’s ship-recycling yard had previously received a contract to recycle Sao Paulo’s sister-ship the French Clemenceu but ran into similar difficulties. The Supreme Court of India stepped in in 2006 denying the ship access to Alang on the grounds of environmental risks.

Latest inspection raises alarm bells

Earlier in January after an inspection the Brazilian navy announced that the ship’s hull was taking in significant water and was at risk of sinking. The rate at which the ship has been flooding indicates that a structural collapse “in just four weeks” is a likely possibility the navy’s report said.

Furthermore the Brazilian navy claimed there is no possibility of saving the hull under the current circumstances.

Is there no other option?

The navy said there is no option but to take the ship to a safe location away from any protected environment zones or undersea cables and sink it in a controlled manner.

However scuttling the ship in the middle of the ocean is likely to release high quantities of asbestos into the water which runs the risk of entering our food cycle. Brazil’s environmental agency told The New York Times that Sao Paulo’s chemicals could harm the ozone layer cause the death of marine wildlife and deteriorate ecosystems in important marine biodiversity hotspots.

Environmental groups have been baffled as to why the navy wouldn’t take the ship back. Under the Basel Convention countries are required to reimport toxic waste that they are unable to successfully export. Activists say Brazil is violating the convention by not allowing the ship to dock and be dealt with in safer ways.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hZXJvc3BhY2UtZGVmZW5zZS90dXJrZXlzLWhhdmFzLW1heS1zdG9wLXNlcnZpY2VzLXJ1c3NpYW4tYWlybGluZXMtdXMtbWFkZS1wbGFuZXMtbGV0dGVyLTIwMjMtMDItMDMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Turkey's Havas may stop services to Russian airlines' U.S.-made planes,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/turkeys-havas-may-stop-services-russian-airlines-us-made-planes-letter-2023-02-03/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXV0ZXJzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9hZXJvc3BhY2UtZGVmZW5zZS90dXJrZXlzLWhhdmFzLW1heS1zdG9wLXNlcnZpY2VzLXJ1c3NpYW4tYWlybGluZXMtdXMtbWFkZS1wbGFuZXMtbGV0dGVyLTIwMjMtMDItMDMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5sZW1vbmRlLmZyL2VuL2Vudmlyb25tZW50L2FydGljbGUvMjAyMy8wMi8wNC9mb3JtZXItYWlyY3JhZnQtY2Fycmllci1mb2NoLXN1bmstaW4tYXRsYW50aWMtb2NlYW4tb2ZmLWJyYXppbGlhbi1jb2FzdF82MDE0NDE5XzExNC5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Former aircraft carrier Foch sunk in Atlantic Ocean off Brazilian coast,"On November 2 2000 the aircraft carrier Foch left the port of Toulon for Brest where the French Navy handed over its flag to the Brazilian Navy which bought the ship. ERIC ESTRADE / AFP

The pollution warnings issued in recent days by environmental associations had no effect: Late in the afternoon of Friday January 3 the Brazilian Navy announced that the Sao Paulo aircraft carrier formerly known as the Foch had sunk 350 kilometers off its coast in the Atlantic Ocean at a depth of 5000 meters. In its statement the Navy explained that it was a ""planned and controlled sinking"" by scuttling the hull with explosive charges. Jacky Bonnemains of the French association Robin des Bois (""Robinhood"") along with many other organizations called it an environmental catastrophe.

This is because the ship was still loaded with asbestos and other toxic products – including cadmium lead mercury and PCBs in proportions that are still being debated. Scuttling was a convenient and inexpensive way to get rid of the 24000-tonne shell which had been the subject of a legal diplomatic and environmental battle for months. This is a sad end for the ship that was one of the jewels of the French Navy for 40 years along with its sister ship the Clemenceau.

'Hazardous waste'

Brazil bought the Foch from France in 2000 after a costly but incomplete asbestos removal and decontamination project. Renamed Sao Paulo it was of little use to its buyer as it experienced a large number of breakdowns and accidents. In 2021 it was sold for a derisory sum to Sök Denizcilik a Turkish company that hoped to make a profit from the resale of its metal. The buyer planned to dismantle it in Aliaga near Izmir at a site that has been approved according to European standards. On August 4 2022 the former Foch left the port of Rio de Janeiro for what was to be its last voyage towed at a speed of 4 knots by a Dutch company's tug. In the boat's heyday it could do 32 knots (60 km/h) driven by the 126000 horsepower of the engines.

As it approached the Mediterranean the Turkish Ministry of the Environment withdrew its authorization citing the risks for workers and the environment under pressure from local organizations. Several international environmental groups also felt that the ship should be classified as ""hazardous waste"" according to the terms of the Basel Convention. After circling off the coast of Morocco the ship was towed in the opposite direction and arrived near Suape in the state of Pernambuco. It ended up 25 kilometers from the coast at the edge of Brazilian waters. Ibama the Brazilian environmental agency suspended the export authorization and demanded a new expert opinion to determine the environmental risk. But the local court prohibited entry into the port and the dry docking of the vessel for examination citing the threat of pollution. The Turkish company demanded the cancellation of the contract while the Brazilian navy maintained that the responsibility for the vessel ""lay with whoever bought it.""

Scientists in a commonly overlooked field are warning about the growing danger posed by deadly fungal infections saying the world is not prepared for a pandemic triggered by a nasty fungal disease.

The issue has been thrust into the popular imagination with HBO's hit TV series The Last of Us adapted from a video game of the same name in which a fungal virus gets into the global food supply before infecting humans taking over their bodies and turning them into angry cannibalistic zombies. The swift collapse of society follows.

Sound far-fetched? Well not exactly says Associate Professor Rebecca Drummond who studies immune defence mechanisms against fungal brain infections at the University of Birmingham.

The particular fungus at the centre of the show called Cordyceps is known as the ""zombie fungus"" for its ability to infect a variety of insects killing its host before using its body as a puppet for its own needs. Currently there is no way the fungus could do that to a warm-blooded human – but that doesn't mean never.

The dystopian storyline of the human-killing fungus has sparked some uncomfortable questions. Source: HBO

The Last of Us: Could it really happen?

“I think the show has a pretty a good scientific premise but everything is accelerated to what we would see in reality” Professor Drummond told Yahoo News Australia.

Cordyceps like most fungi likes cooler temperatures and can't grow at the human body’s internal temperature of 37 degrees. As the opening scene in the show alludes to climate change could provide evolutionary pressure for certain fungal species to evolve to thrive in warmer conditions – something that scientists are already beginning to see some evidence of.

Additionally Cordyceps is no match for a human’s immune response which is far superior to that of an insect. To get to the point where it could infect our brain and nervous system at the same time would be an evolutionary process that would take thousands of years Drummond argues.

In The Last of Us infected humans pass on the virus by biting the next victim. While a perfectly dramatic solution for the show in reality the transmissibility of such a disease would be very limited.

“Most fungal infections aren't fungal diseases in the sense that if I was infected by a fungal disease I couldn't give it to someone else. That's partly because you tend to get infected by fungal infections by spores and fungi tend to produce their spores when they're lacking in nutrients ... and inside of us there's plenty of nutrients” Drummond explained.

In a comment that sums up much of the show’s premise she added: “That's not to say that could never happen but it's quite a big evolutionary jump.”

So while the basic plot is plausible it’s perhaps something for our great great great great great grandkids to start worrying about.

“I don't think it’s something we need to be super concerned about” Drummond said. But that doesn’t mean researchers aren’t worried about other threats posed by harmful fungal infections.

World 'completely unprepared' for fungal pandemic

Researchers like Dr Neil Stone leading fungal expert at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in London have taken the rare spotlight now on fungal diseases to issue a bleak reality check.

“I think we underestimate fungal infections at our peril” he told the BBC this week. “We've already done that for too long and we are completely unprepared for dealing with a fungal pandemic.”

It’s a sentiment that Drummond agrees with wholeheartedly.

“I would 100 per cent agree” she told Yahoo. “The fungal infection field generally has been very under appreciated and under funded and that’s partly because the impact fungal infections have on global human health has really been underestimated for a very long time.”

But that’s starting to change. Particularly in the wake of outbreaks like the black fungus outbreak in India that has plagued the country's Covid recovery.

In October last year the World Health Organisation released its first-ever list of fungal pathogens posing the greatest threat to human health warning that some were becoming more widespread and drug resistant.

Drummond also points to the fungus Candida auris which is able to withstand temperatures up to 42 degrees and can spread rapidly around hospitals and aged care homes. It causes an infection somewhat similar to sepsis where the fungus gets into the blood and organs preventing them from working properly.

“It’s been a particularly interesting fungus because it appeared on three different continents around the same time” she said. “And when we did genetic testing on those we realised they were all independent.

“It’s a fungus that’s everywhere” she continued “most fungi are but they don’t bother us because we have intact normal healthy immune systems.” But due to factors including the AIDs epidemic Covid-19 and the widespread use of antibiotics today “we now have a very large population of people with damaged immune systems – and they are the ones who get fungal infections” Drummond explained.

Adding to the threat is the inconvenient fact that medical remedies to combat fungal diseases are quite lacking with only a handful of antiviral fungal drugs at our disposal – and Candida auris is already resistant to most of them.

The Last of Us has certainly brought the issue into focus and for researchers like Professor Drummond that’s a good thing.

While a vast majority of fungal species aren’t harmful to humans “on the whole there’s a lot of the fungal kingdom that we don’t know about” she said.

“There might well be other potential pathogens out there.”

La Brea Avenue. This property is currently home of the CEMEX Concrete Plant which has been operating for approximately 60 years. The acquisition includes parcels located in both West Hollywood and Los Angeles with the cement plant spanning across both cities.

The Real Deal reports that at the time of the transaction Stew Weston who worked on the deal as part of a brokerage team at CBRE floated a possible residential conversion for the site saying that West Hollywood officials had “previously indicated their desire for a large mixed-use multifamily development.”

CIM Group has recently filed documents with the Los Angeles City Planning Department indicating their intention to convert the old cement plant located in West Hollywood into a seven-story office building.

The CEMEX Concrete Plant will continue operating while future development plans for the site are progressed.

According to Business Wire CIM Group is an active owner developer and operator of a variety of commercial properties proximate to the CEMEX Concrete Plant site. The cement plant properties are just blocks away from The Lot at Formosa studio campus and connected to the growing Sycamore District a distinctive corridor that blends the adaptive reuse of existing architecturally distinct buildings with new construction that has brought apartments creative office and specialty retail space to the area. It is home to leading media and entertainment companies including SiriusXM Live Nation/Ticketmaster and Hyperobject Industries as well as art galleries retail brands and culinary establishments such as Tartine Gigi’s Hollywood Mizlala Sightglass Coffee Just One Eye and Jeffrey Deitch.

Records show Gance settled on the $6.22 million property a week after the December auction of 89 Kingsway. The 368 sq m double-storey shop is opposite the Glen Shopping Centre.

Stonebridge agents Nic Hage Rorey James Sarah Xi and Jacob Biviano ran the auction which attracted a big crowd of about 250 people and six bidders. It sold on a tight yield of 2.6 per cent. The shop on Kingsway is leased to a Grill’d outlet. Planning controls allow for six-level developments on the retail strip. The suburban city centre has undergone a transformation in the past 20 years with more than $1 billion worth of development in the past five years alone. Rents rival the likes of blue-chip strips of Church Street Brighton and High Street Armadale James said. Indeed Ainsworth Property recently leased the former HSBC outlet at 38 Kingsway to a local optometrist at $1328 a sq m.

Zelman Ainsworth said dozens of offers from a wide range of tenants made an offer for the 94 sq m shop. Chemist Warehouse established by Gance’s brother Jack Gance and Mario Verrocchi has more than 500 outlets across Australia and is widely expected to list on the Australian Stock Exchange later in the year. The company’s directors regularly crop up as buyers of Chemist Warehouse store freeholds. The auction at 89 Kingsway Glen Waverley attracted a big crowd. Developer targets

Offshore Chinese investors appear to be shifting their horizons to the inner-north after years of focus on the CBD and eastern suburbs. An international developer paid $3.4 million for a block of flats at 140 Yarra Street Abbotsford near the river. The buyer outbid eight other parties for the flats which need substantial renovation. The block’s individual owners who had already obtained a permit for eight townhouses joined forces to sell the 854 sq m property. CBRE agents David Minty Nathan Mufale Alex Brierley and JJ Heng negotiated the transaction. An offshore investor has made a first foray into the Australian property market buying the Fairfield Pizza shop – a double-storey building at 218-222 Station Street on the corner of Separation Street.

The property sold for $2.71 million on a yield of 3.23 per cent. The CBRE team and Nelson Alexander Commercial’s Kristian Linardi and Damian Theiz handled the sale with Advise Transact also involved. Elsewhere in the inner-north a self-managed superannuation fund snapped up a double-storey shop at 6 Smith Street Collingwood next door to McDonald’s headquarters. The shop sold by Fitzroys’ Lewis Waddell and Ervin Niyaz fetched $1.93 million on a 4.9 per cent yield. Records show it last changed hands in 2013 when McDonalds sold it to the vendor for $836000. Shakespeare Hotel

The old Shakespeare Hotel near Chinatown is up for lease following its recent renovation. The 327 sq m double-storey building at 167 Exhibition Street now has a mezzanine and a 52 sq m rooftop terrace. The hotel dates back to the 1860s when Exhibition Street was the centre of the seamy side of city’s culture. The hotel’s sign offering rooms for 3p is still visible on the Lees Place corner close to the Bourke Street corner. It is still in a busy entertainment precinct. Despite the gloom on CBD visitors City of Melbourne data show at least 123 new hospitality venues opened last year including cafés restaurants nightclubs and entertainment venues. Fitzroys’ Travis Keenan James Lockwood and Franklin Gikas are handling the leasing campaign.

Aged-care sales Aged-care operators have been shedding homes at a steady pace and the latest to hit the market is Trinity Care’s former Burwood venue. The 45-bed home at 8-18 Edwards Street is on a large 5614 sq m site and is newer than many on the market. It comes with development approval to build a new 110-bed home but the high cost of construction means it is likely to go to another aged-care operator. Based on recent deals with buyers keen to refurbish and use as supported accommodation this one is likely to sell for more than $9 million. Trinity Care which has other homes in Greensborough and Balwyn took over the facility in 2015 and vacated the property last year. Records show it has been owned for some time by Georjose Care."

After all there are tens of thousands of investment options out there offered by a growing number of investment platforms.

I think ready-made portfolios can be a good starting point. These are off-the-peg portfolios and offered by most investment platforms. They are ideal for people who don't want to spend their time handpicking funds and learning the ins and outs.

They don't require you to make any decisions about what to invest in. The only questions you'll need to answer are about how much risk you are willing to take on.

As a rule of thumb the more risk you take the greater the chance of higher returns over the long term.

Off-the-peg: The only questions you'll need to answer are about how much risk you are willing to take on

At investment website Boring Money where I am founder and chief executive we test all of the major investment platforms regularly and independently evaluate their ready-made portfolios.

We crunch the numbers to see which have made the best returns for investors. Our figures cover the two years to the end of December 2022 and are total returns after all fees. Two years is a relatively short timeframe when it comes to investing and performance in the future may be quite different. But at least this gives a snapshot of how the platforms are faring.

We also have more than 25 test accounts which we use to find out for ourselves what they are like for customer experience. As well as our own experiences we also take into consideration the thousands of reviews of investment platforms on the boringmoney.co.uk website.

As a result we have found the ready-made portfolios for investment Isas that offer what we believe is the best experience combined with the highest returns in recent years. We have put them into three categories: high medium and low risk – see the tables opposite. Only you will know which category is right for you.

However if your investment time horizon is ten years or more then you could consider the highest-risk profiles – outlined in the first of our tables.

And if your horizon is nearer five years then you should be considering lower-risk profiles – that's the tables detailing medium and low-risk options.

Less than five years and cash may be your best bet.

Only three of the ten medium-risk portfolios analysed were up over the last two years.

That is because they tend to hold a high proportion of bonds which have seen values plummet as interest rates have risen rapidly.

However most have got off to a better start this year and hopefully they should recover further if interest rates do not continue to escalate.

For those people investing with shorter time horizons or who don't have an appetite for alarming ups and downs the low-risk portfolios should be a good option.

In theory they should offer a smoother investment ride; they will make less over the long term but face less short-term volatility.

However many performed poorly last year as they contain a high proportion of bonds which struggled in the face of rising interest rates and the fallout from the mini-Budget. They should start to behave more calmly again and did start to improve in the last three months of 2022.

The four low-risk options chosen did the best – or the least badly – over the last two years.

The apparent termination of United Steelworkers Local 5 employees at one of the West Coast’s major oil refining facilities prompted the union to file complaints with federal labor regulators.

The workers Chevron fired — two during the walkout and three in the months that followed — were mostly safety operators at the refinery who played leadership roles in the strike according to union president Tracy Scott.

The firings “were unjust” Scott said.

One of those fired was B.K. White a top union negotiator who became the face of the labor action and had worked at the refinery for nearly three decades.

“You could just tell it was retaliatory or punitive in nature” said White vice president of USW Local 5. “It appears there’s a concerted effort to break the union.”

In a complaint filed with the National Labor Relations Board the union alleges that Chevron ordered its members to train contractors to do union-covered work and then punished them for their labor activities. The NLRB has deferred action on the Local 5’s unfair labor practice charges pending arbitration of a grievance the union had already filed with the company.

News of the firings comes months after a 10-week-long strike by hundreds of USW workers. It was the first walkout at Chevron’s Richmond refinery in 40 years.

The marathon labor action ended up delivering only modest gains to workers. The contract approved by a slim majority of union members gave a small bump in pay and medical benefits to refinery employees who went without paychecks for more than two months.

“You were just asking for a little dignity and little relief from a corporation that’s raking in billions of dollars and not sharing it with its workers but sharing it with their board of directors or their stockholders on Wall Street” White said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNvaW5yZXB1YmxpYy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMi8wNS9vY2NpZGVudGFsLXBldHJvbGV1bS1zdG9jay1kb3duLW92ZXItMS01MC1vbi1pbnRyYWRheS1iYXNpYy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Occidental Petroleum Stock Down Over 1.50% on Intraday Basic,"OXY stock struggled and slipped 1.97% in the last trading session.

OXY is ranked 183rd on the 2021 Fortune 500 based on its 2022 revenue.

Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE: OXY) is an American company founded in 1920 by Armand Hammer. The company is headquartered in Houston Texas United States.

OXY stock prices are down by 1.97% and were trading at $61.24 after the market closed on February 3 2023. However the February 2 closing price was $62.47 which is higher by $1.23 compared to the February 3 closing price.

OXY Petroleum is among the leading hydrogen petrochemical companies globally and is ranked 183rd on the 2021 Fortune 500 based on its 2022 revenue and earnings.

In the first quarter of 2022 OXY’s total revenue was $8.35b from which net income was $4.88b. The revenue in the second quarter increased by a few percent and was $10.68b but net income decreased compared to the first quarter and the recorded net income was $3.76b.

The third quarter revenue was $9.39b but the net income was the lowest in all quarters which was $2.75b.It is expected that by the end of this month OXY could release its Q4 2022 earnings which may help stock to gain prices.

In the last five days the trading price of OXY stocks slipped by more than 6.05% compared to trading prices one week ago. The total decrement that OXY mirrored is $3.95.

The top three biggest oil companies in the United States are ExxonMobil Chevron And Marathon Petroleum Corp. In the context of revenue ExxonMobil is topper among these three and generates over $ 200 billion annually. Chevron earns annual revenue of $155 billion and Marathon only earns $100 billion.

Shell Plc is an internal energy company with 70 locations involved in the explorationproductionrefining and marketing of oil and natural gas and manufacturing and marketing of chemicals.

Shell released its Q4 2022 financial statements where it mentioned that it has reported the highest profit in the last 115 years which is around $42.3 billion.

Since the Russia and Ukraine war started global oil companies have mirrored a hike in their profit as for a certain period of time oil export from Russia was halted or countries were fearing to purchase oil from them.

Russia is the leading oil supplier in the global oil market and due to the war situation the global oil market was affected. However the market tried hard to control the volatility and at some point it was successful.

Everything is cooked with butter even if they don’t say so Ordered fajita tacos on corn tortillas with no cheese with double cilantro lime rice. Apparently they cook the cilantro lime rice with butter. Don’t do it. Chesley Garrett Response from Go Dairy Free We did verify with the company that the information above is correct. According to the company using dairy butter is not a corporate policy. As mentioned above management and owners of individual locations can take liberties so it is important to always check. If the staff states they use butter ask them to verify the ingredients. Often staff will misrepresent a dairy-free buttery spread or cooking oil as simply “butter” when asked. And always make sure you verify your allergen needs when ordering.

""As of now we plan to open in mid-April — of course that is subject to change as we make progress on construction"" said Julia Doyle director of public relations for Baton Rouge Louisiana-based Raising Cane's.

Doyle confirmed the Marlborough restaurant would not open March 21 a date that has been associated with it in Google searches. In more recent months the restaurant at 141 Boston Post Road West (Route 20) has been completing construction adding additional signage and working on the interior of the building.

A spokesperson for Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers said it's aiming to open its Marlborough restaurant in mid-April. The 141 Boston Post Road West location would be the Louisiana-based chain's second in Massachusetts and the first to open since 2009.

The restaurant will be the second Raising Cane's in Massachusetts and the first since its Boston location on Commonwealth Avenue opened in 2009. The fast-food chain specializes in chicken fingers which are the only entree on the menu. Customers can choose different combo platters that feature chicken fingers along with a number of side options including crinkle-cut fries Texas toast and coleslaw.

All meals come with the signature Cane's dipping sauce.

Food fight:McDonald's Raising Cane's settle dispute over traffic flow at Marlborough site

The restaurant first planned to open in Marlborough in 2021. But plans were set back by a dispute with a neighboring McDonald's which objected to the restaurant receiving a special permit from the city. McDonald's officials said that under the special permit customers for Raising Cane's would be passing through McDonald's driveways.

McDonald's sued the city over granting the special permit. However Raising Cane's and McDonalds reached a private agreement that allowed Raising Cane's to proceed with construction.

The restaurant will join a crowded scene on Marlborough's west side just off Interstate 495 and near Apex Entertainment. Besides McDonald's there are Wendy's Chick-fil-A and Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants in close proximity.

Nearby sit-down options include 110 Grill LongHorn Steakhouse Evviva Trattoria and The 99 Restaurant & Pub.

Founded in 1996 Raising Cane's operates about 600 restaurants. The next-closest one to Boston is in Pennsylvania.

Sign up to receive the newsletter in your inbox each Wednesday night.

Utah will be home to 30 of the 350 temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints once construction is complete on all announced temples. The Deseret News recently spoke to the church’s Utah Area president Elder Kevin W. Pearson to talk about the state and temples after the media open house tour for the Taylorsville Utah Temple.

“Utah’s really still the breadbasket of the church” he said in an interview that touched on membership growth and activity and temple covenants and blessings.

Elder Pearson helped lead the media tour which kicked off a public open house that ends on May 18. The Taylorsville Temple will be dedicated on June 2.

Elder Pearson 67 who earned a Harvard MBA and was the CEO of a health care information technology and research company has a broad perspective on the church having served as a General Authority Seventy since 2008 when he was called while serving as president of the Washington Tacoma Mission. He previously served as president of the Pacific Area president of the North America West Area counselor in the Europe East Area presidency and area assistant in the North America Southwest Area.

Deseret News: What is the “State of the Union” for the Utah Area?

Elder Pearson: You’ve got roughly 2.2 million members of the church here. You’ve got some of the most active members in the church here. We have 645 soon to be 650 stakes in Utah. So there’s a tremendous amount of strength in Utah. I’m working with some of the strongest membership of the church.

This is really still where the bench strength is in terms of leadership. Probably still 52-plus percent of all senior couples that serve in the world come out of Utah. About 28-29-30% of all the young missionaries come out of Utah. So Utah’s really still the breadbasket of the church. It is a global church to be certain but the church globally is facilitated by the faithfulness of the members of the church.

Now 21 temples operate in Utah of 30 that are announced (for the state). Where do you think that comes from? It comes from the fact that members of the church have been so faithful in keeping the commandments that they have been blessed and prospered. They’ve prospered in the land to use Book of Mormon language and because of that their faithfulness in paying tithings has created extraordinary opportunity now. You think about April 6 1830 and the organization of the church then with six members to where we are today and what it took in terms of sacrifice to build Kirtland (Ohio) and Nauvoo (Illinois) and now the extraordinary abundance that the church has been blessed with is a direct function of the faithfulness of members of the church. It is extraordinary to go from location to location and witness that.

Almost every stake you go to you think ‘This has got to be the most faithful stake on on the earth’ but it’s just over and over and over. Now having said that there are struggles there are challenges for members of the church. The Salt Lake Valley is sort of declining in membership as people move out to the southwest and to Highland and on the other side of the lake and other places. So there are challenges but there are areas where the church is just exploding. We cannot possibly build buildings fast enough. And there are other areas where it’s like ‘OK this used to be an enormously strong area. Now it’s it’s changing.’ So Utah’s very dynamic is the point I’m trying to make. The church is very dynamic in Utah. It’s not monolithic in terms of the experience you have in any given stake or ward but it still continues to be the stronghold of the church. And it’s just a joy to serve here.

Deseret News: During the April general conference many of the talks were about temple covenants about finding stillness about following Jesus Christ’s teachings about the two great laws of loving God and loving others. What did you take away from conference?

Elder Pearson: If members listened carefully with all of these temples being announced and built — there seems to be one open house after another in Utah — I just hope that the members of the church don’t get casual about the extraordinary significance of having a House of the Lord.

We want to make sure that people are less excited about the architecture of a new building and ‘Boy I wonder what the color scheme is in this temple’ and a lot more focused on ‘What promises am I making what are those covenants?’ — the covenants of obedience and sacrifice and chastity and the gospel and consecration. We make very real promises to our Heavenly Father and the Savior and they are absolutely serious about those.

We’re hoping that members of the church will be ever more increasingly serious and focused on their own covenants. What we’re hoping is that these new temples will help members become ever more focused on putting the Savior and their covenants at the very center of their lives and not just having those an aspect of their lives. We hope the increased proximity of temples will help them with that. The proximity we hope will increase significantly the frequency that people get to the temple. The hope is that there will be a transformational mindset that whenever people see or think about the temple they’ll think about the Savior and they’ll think about the sacred promises they’ve made and they’ll be even more determined and committed to keeping them in every aspect of their life. We hope that members will come to cherish and honor those commitments and covenants above any and all other commitments in their lives. I think that’s the essence of the messages you would have heard over the weekend in conference.

We’re going to teach that. We’re going to continue to teach that everywhere we go at President Russell M. Nelson’s behest so that children will grow up knowing what promises are and what they mean and that they’ll be increasing in their capacity commitment and determination to make and keep sacred covenants in the temple and keep them all their lives.

Deseret News: What are the blessings that come from keeping those commitments in that focused way and making them central and making Christ central in one’s life?

Elder Pearson: My wife’s parents would be an example of this. They were Norwegian and they sold everything they had to come to the U.S. so they could be sealed in the temple. The blessing they wanted was an eternal family. First and foremost that is the blessing. For my wife June and I it’s to be sealed together for forever. The blessing is it changes the way we live our lives it changes the way we think about our marriage that we’re in it for the long term. We don’t let short-term roadblocks or bumps in the road upend us. That is a blessing. It shapes the way we live our lives. For many of members of the church in the past they would get to the temple once in their life and that was it but they went for that one blessing and that assurance.

For us in our day and time the blessing of the temple is that you can come and you can you can rise above the noise. You can rise above the lack of civility. You can rise above the disregard for sacred things and you can come to a space where you are literally a guest in the house of the Lord and you can feel more powerfully the influence of the Holy Ghost. You can feel a sense of peace and assurance in your life. Life is not perfect and there are many challenges that people face but they can come here and feel the blessing that because they’ve made covenants with the Savior in the end all will be well.

That is a day-to-day week-to-week month-to-month blessing that people can have in their lives that’s different than coming for the one blessing of being sealed for time and all eternity and never having an opportunity to go to the temple again.

In addition to that the temple is a place of revelation and a place to feel close to the Lord and to get the answers to challenges or questions or difficulties that you’re facing to gather up strength. All of those things are available in the temple. If you’re listening to our prophet in the days to come we are going to need that more than ever before. So I think the blessings available in the temple are constant but they’re also changing in terms of the times in which we live.

That’s something we hope we can help communicate effectively to the members of the church. Now you can come for daily blessings and weekly blessings and not only the singular hope of eternal families.

What I’m reading

Former BYU athlete Courtney Wayment focuses on ‘faith over fear’ in preparation for U.S. Olympic trials

The road to the top is often long and winding. Just read about this journey to the top of professional baseball.

When I saw this headline — “How a forgotten basketball icon revolutionized the NBA and blazed a trail for Nikola Jokic” — I immediately thought of the late BYU star Kresimir Cosic. And sure enough he was in the story."

...AIR QUALITY ALERT IN EFFECT UNTIL NOON CDT MONDAY... * WHAT...The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency has issued an Air Quality Alert for fine particles pollution. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is expected to reach the Red or Unhealthy category. * WHERE...All of central and southern Minnesota. * WHEN...Until noon CDT Monday. * IMPACTS...Some members of the general public may experience health effects. Sensitive groups such as people with lung disease (including asthma) heart disease and children and older adults may experience health effects. * ADDITIONAL DETAILS...A band of very heavy smoke from wildfires in northeast British Columbia has moved into northern Minnesota and will sweep south across the state on Sunday behind a cold front. The smoke will reach central Minnesota by Sunday afternoon and southern Minnesota by Sunday evening. The timing of maximum smoke impacts in the Twin Cities will be from around 5pm to 10pm - and this would be the time to avoid outdoor exertion if possible. Smoke will have a rapid onset as the front passes and will linger overnight before clearing Monday morning. PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS ACTIONS... Sensitive groups such as people with lung disease (including asthma) heart disease and children and older adults should avoid prolonged or heavy exertion. The general public should limit prolonged or heavy exertion. Reduce or eliminate activities that contribute to air pollution such as outdoor burning and use of residential wood burning devices. Reduce vehicle trips and vehicle idling as much as possible. Keep windows closed overnight to prevent smoke from getting indoors. && For information on current air quality conditions in your area; and to sign up for daily air quality forecasts and alert; notifications by email text message phone or the EPA AirNow; mobile app visit https://www.pca.state.mn.us/air-water-land-; climate/current-air-quality-conditions.

Both leaders - Jinnah and Iqbal - had espoused the cause of Pakistan on religious lines. Yousuf Nazar UK-based former equity investments head and strategist at Citigroup said this is 2023 and a lot has changed and nations that don't embrace change fall behind. He also said that Islamabad must think about what went terribly wrong when and how.

The advice comes as Pakistan has plunged into a deep economic crisis and is on the brink of default on sovereign debt. Its forex reserves have slipped below $4 dollar the currency has fallen to a record low of 265 per US dollar and inflation has soared to a decade high of over 24 per cent for months now. The low forex reserves have forced the government to cut imports of food and fuel which has created a shortage of several items resulting in a price rise which in turn has triggered chaos and a riots-like situation in some provinces.

If Pakistan is to move forward and have any hope of catching up with the rest of Asia it will have to move beyond Jinnah and Iqbal. This is 2023 and a lot has changed. Nations that don’t embrace change fall behind. It must think about what went terribly wrong when how? 1/n — Yousuf Nazar (@YousufNazar) January 31 2023

Not just the economy Pakistan is also facing security threats from within by Tehrik-e-Taliban who are not very different from the Taliban in Afghanistan. Just this week they carried out a suicide bombing attack at the Police Lines area of Peshawar killing 101. However security experts believe that Islamabad is partly responsible for the threat as they were the ones who celebrated the return of the Taliban in Kabul in 2021.

In a detailed thread Yousuf Nazar talked about the religious militancy whose roots date back to 1947. For most of its history Nazar said Pakistan had been governed as a centralised authoritarian state although it came into existence as a democratic federal state. The first blunder took place just days after the partition when Jinnah dismissed the duly elected government of Dr Khan Sahab on 22 Aug 1947 he added.

""We started on the wrong foot. Pakistan has been plagued by confusion about the role of religion. The roots again go back to 1947-48. Jinnah’s speech on July 1 1948 https://sbp.org.pk/about/history/h_moments.htm contracted in effect his speech of August 11 1948.""

Nazar said the roots of religious militancy again go back to 1947. The first India-Pakistan War of 1947–1948 was fought over Kashmir. ""...on October 22 1947 a Lashkar of tribals from north-western Pakistan. Five thousand strong led an incursion into the valley from Abbottabad. Even as the Indian army came to the rescue of Kashmir’s maharaja the joint incursion of the Lashkars and regular troops enabled Pakistan to acquire roughly two-fifths of Kashmir.""

On October 30 1947 the former finance executive said Mir Laik Ali a special emissary of Quaid-e-Azam met with the US state department officials in Washington and requested American financial assistance. ""A security state that looked toward the west for survival was born.""

Nazar further said that centralised security state that sought western financial assistance for survival while it professed to be cherishing Islamic ideals and rejected the western economic system (according to Jinnah’s July 1 1948 speech) was born in 1947-48 - but those were not the only problems.

Pakistan was a multi-ethnic multi-lingual multi-cultural state when it was born but the former executive lamented instead of celebrating diversity and respecting different cultures ethnicities and languages it started off by imposing Urdu as the only state language in March 1948. This problem was further aggravated by another factor: 'opportunist kleptocracy'.

Nazar said Muslim League a political party founded by Jinnah came to be dominated by a feudal aristocracy that contributed little to the Pakistan movement. ""It was full of opportunists who jumped on the Muslim League bandwagon and had no vision for Pakistan’s future beyond empty rhetoric."" He said that leaders do make mistakes and nations go astray and do course correction - but they do so only through introspection and free and open dialogue.

The finance executive then picked a few blunders like a military takeover that he said defined Pakistan’s future course. ""1971 is a tragic chapter by itself and we still are in denial that the majority left. Post 1971 through the 2nd amendment ordinary mortals arrogated themselves the right to determine the relationship between God and an individual and had sown the seeds of bigotry and intolerance"" Nazar stated adding that Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's operation in Balochistan the largest mineral-rich province of Pakistan was his another blunder.

Nazar then said 25 years ago Pakistan's GDP per capita was 46 per cent higher than India's but now it was 20 per cent less. There was little recognition in Islamabad that as globalisation swept across the world after the fall of the Berlin Wall countries like India China and Bangladesh seized the opportunities offered by trade liberalisation and progressed he added. ""But Pakistan's ruling elites continued to view the world through a cold war mindset and thought foreign aid would continue to enable Pakistan to extract geo-strategic rents.""

The round includes only existing investors meaning all shareholders will maintain their relative stake in the company.

Existing investors include Shashua himself Swiss wealth management group Julius Baer the Japanese financial conglomerate SBI China-based technology company Tencent U.S. private equity firm West Coast Equity Partners the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Provident Fund OurCrowd and Hachshara Insurance Company.

The timing of the round is somewhat surprising considering the bank raised $120 million in December 2021. However sources at the bank which is headed by CEO Gal Bar Dea and chairman Shuki Oren explained that the new round is the result of regulatory requirements made by the Bank of Israel and not due to One Zero requiring more funding as much of the money from the previous round has still not been put to use by the bank. One Zero has raised a total of $250 million since its founding in 2019.

The latest round was made at a $320 million valuation which hasn’t changed since the previous round over a year ago. The fact the valuation hasn’t risen over this time is slightly surprising as well considering the bank began onboarding clients during this period. However sources at the bank said the valuation wasn’t really a factor in this round due to the fact that it only included existing investors and they all retained their stake in the company.

One Zero’s pitch deck to investors does however reveal that it plans to embark on a more traditional funding round towards the end of the year at a higher valuation. This round is planned as part of its preparations to expand into Europe and ahead of a potential IPO.





The pitch deck also revealed several interesting details regarding the bank’s activity. According to One Zero it already manages over 45000 accounts and a total of one billion shekels (approximately $290 million). Around 300-400 new accounts are opened on a daily basis although only 29% of clients have made their One Zero account their main banking account. One Zero has provided around NIS 100 million ($29 million) of credit to date and expects to end the year with revenue of around $60 million.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZ3VhcmRpYW4uY28udHQvYnVzaW5lc3MvZmlyc3QtY2l0aXplbnMtZ3JvdXAtcmVjb3Jkcy0xOTk1bS1wcm9maXQtaW4tZmlyc3QtdGhyZWUtbW9udGhzLTYuMi4xNjI1NzY1LjgyYzg1MjU1ZjjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,First Citizens Group records $199.5M profit in first three months,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.guardian.co.tt', port=443): Read timed out.

We may receive a commission on purchases made from links.

Almost every household spends part of its monthly budget on household goods. While this could mean anything that's used to maintain a home we will limit this to cleaning products including hand soap dish soap laundry detergent disinfecting wipes paper towels and all-purpose sprays. If you often buy these items from brands like Clorox Gain or Dawn you may be wondering where to purchase them for the lowest price.

Two of the most common retailers to buy household goods from are Target and Walmart. To see which one has the cheapest prices we will be comparing the exact same cleaning products from both these stores. If you're shopping online you should also take into consideration the cost of shipping. While Target provides free shipping for orders over $35 or for those who use their RedCard Walmart's delivery costs around $7 to $8 unless you're a member of Walmart+ which costs about $13 a month. They both also allow you to pick up in-store or have the items brought out to your vehicle.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vZXRmZm9jdXMvYmxvZy9ub2JsLWJlc3QtZGl2aWRlbmQtZ3Jvd3RoLXN0b2Nrcy1pbi1zaW5nbGUtZXRm0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NOBL: The Best Dividend Growth Stocks In A Single ETF,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/etffocus/blog/nobl-best-dividend-growth-stocks-in-single-etf on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vZXRmZm9jdXMvYmxvZy9ub2JsLWJlc3QtZGl2aWRlbmQtZ3Jvd3RoLXN0b2Nrcy1pbi1zaW5nbGUtZXRm0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdW50YWludmlld3RvZGF5LmNhL2hvbWUtc3dlZXQtaG9tZS90b3AtZml2ZS10b2lsZXQtYm93bC1jbGVhbmVycy1mb3ItMjAyMy02NDg4OTMz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top Five Toilet Bowl Cleaners for 2023 - The Albertan News,"We all love a clean and sparkling home but when it comes to the bathroom there is a bit of an “ick” factor – especially when faced with a dirty toilet bowl.

Faced with a high dependence on China  India plans to bring out a policy framework and time-bound action plan for exploration processing use and recycling of critical minerals in the country - an essential step towards self-sufficiency across several sectors and energy transition.A comprehensive critical minerals (CMs) policy is likely to be announced later this month as inter-ministerial discussions on the plan are close to wrapping up people aware of the development told ET. Critical minerals (CMs) such as copper lithium nickel and cobalt and rare earth elements (REEs) are key to clean energy technologies as they are needed for production of wind turbines and solar photovoltaic cells to electric vehicle (EV) batteries and electricity magnets - all witnessing phenomenal growth in demand across the globe. China currently dominates both global concentration of mineral deposits and processing of critical minerals.It is critical for India to reduce dependency on China and ensure availability of critical minerals and REEs to remain self-sufficient and go ahead with its energy transition plans.The Ministry of Mines has recently circulated a draft policy and action plan on critical minerals to stakeholder ministries and departments for their views ET has learnt. Most departments are said to be largely on board and the policy is likely to be made public this month.""The idea is to start from the scratch"" a senior official told ET. ""Several nations are vying for critical mineral reserves across the globe and India is already late and needs to catch up fast.""Various government arms from the ministries of power new and renewable energy finance and defence to National Security Council Secretariat and the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) are expected to join hands with the mines ministry in the mission to scout for critical minerals.The latest Economic Survey has in fact termed availability of critical minerals and REEs as the possible next ""geopolitical battleground"" just as crude oil has been over the last fifty years. It has also flagged the need to create ""strategic mineral reserves"" along the lines of strategic petroleum reserves to ensure a continuous supply of minerals.The proposed action plan suggests a multidimensional approach - including attracting private investments - so that India can work on the entire value chain associated with critical minerals from exploration and processing to usage and recycling.""A series of steps are envisaged across stakeholder ministries to ease the pathway and address all aspects of the critical minerals value chain"" said the official quoted above.First on the Centre's to-do list is to identify 'critical minerals' for India. While assessments and tentative lists have earlier been drawn up by Niti Aayog and through another DST report the government is yet to finalise or notify a list of critical minerals for the country. The government will also address other aspects of the critical mineral value chain. The Geological Survey of India ( GSI ) will embark on a national exploration project to check for the presence of critical minerals in the country.Considering the centrality of critical minerals to manufacturing across growing sectors the government is counting on the private sector to join the mission. The finance ministry and DPIIT are expected to work out an incentive plan to boost private sector investment across the CM value chain. Ministries of power and new and renewable energy are expected to assess industry requirements of critical minerals.The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) along with the education ministry and top institutes such as Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) IISc Bangalore and the Council of Scientific & Industrial Research (CSIR) network will help identify the right technology solutions for processing of critical minerals in the country - a field dominated by China.The NSCS and the defence ministry are expected to identify possible strategic reserves of critical minerals as suggested in the Economic Survey.The survey also recommended policies to encourage investment in internal research including technological innovation for mineral exploration and processing and development of recycling reusing and repurposing (R3) technologies.The soon-to-be-announced policy has addressed all issues raised in the survey sources said.A “globally synchronised energy transition” to non-fossil fuels might be difficult to pull off if adequate REEs and CMs are not available the Economic Survey has cautioned.A recent International Energy Agency (IEA) paper also pointed to the ‘geographical concentration’ of these minerals and the risks of supply disruption.Not only is China one of the biggest repositories of critical minerals besides the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) but it also dominates the processing and refining operations of critical minerals.“China’s share of refining is around 35% for nickel 50-70% for lithium and cobalt and nearly 90% for rare earth elements” the IEA paper said. “Chinese companies have also made substantial investment in overseas assets in Australia Chile DRC and Indonesia. High levels of concentration compounded by complex supply chains increase the risks that could arise from physical disruption trade restrictions or other developments in major producing countries.”The risks run even higher for India with its growing energy needs and uncomfortable equation with China given the friction along the border.A 2022 paper by Centre for Special & Economic Progress (CSEP) detailed India’s critical mineral requirements.Solar power requires silicon silver indium arsenic gallium germanium and tellurium for PV cells. None of these is produced in India.Wind turbines need chromium manganese molybdenum nickel and rare earth elements. India extracts some chromium manganese and REEs but the bulk of the REEs are mined and processed in China.On the EV front key minerals needed to manufacture EV batteries include lithium cobalt and REEs. India does not mine lithium or cobalt though the country has reserves of the latter.A study by the Department of Science and Technology and the Council on Energy Environment and Water had identified 13 minerals that would become most critical by 2030 of which six were critical even in the reference year 2011.There are other strategic concerns as well.A 2014 study by Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses (IDSA) indicated that cobalt germanium molybdenum and tungsten are the ‘strategic minerals’ in the ‘higher risk bracket’ for India. Most of them currently come from China.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2luZGlhL3BtLXRvLXVudmVpbC1zb2xhci1jb29raW5nLXN5c3RlbS1hdC1pbmRpYS1lbmVyZ3ktd2Vlay9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NzU4ODU2MC5jbXPSAXpodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS9wbS10by11bnZlaWwtc29sYXItY29va2luZy1zeXN0ZW0tYXQtaW5kaWEtZW5lcmd5LXdlZWsvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk3NTg4NTYwLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,PM to unveil solar cooking system at India Energy Week,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS9uZXdzL2luZGlhL3BtLXRvLXVudmVpbC1zb2xhci1jb29raW5nLXN5c3RlbS1hdC1pbmRpYS1lbmVyZ3ktd2Vlay9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NzU4ODU2MC5jbXPSAXpodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vbmV3cy9pbmRpYS9wbS10by11bnZlaWwtc29sYXItY29va2luZy1zeXN0ZW0tYXQtaW5kaWEtZW5lcmd5LXdlZWsvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk3NTg4NTYwLmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000256279DE710>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

But Talenthouse which boasts clients including Netflix Sony Coca-Cola and the United Nations has been accused of exploiting artists and failing to pay them in some cases leaving them thousands of pounds out of pocket.

The company based in London shares briefs from its clients and invites artists to create work that matches the brand’s demands – from designing a poster for a Hollywood film to an illustration for a drink brand’s social media campaign.



If their submission is picked the artist is paid a fee and the potential career benefits are huge: their work could be used in marketing materials and seen by millions of people around the world.

Since 2009 Talenthouse claims its service has helped level the playing field for artists internationally. On its corporate page it implores companies to partner with it because “purpose-driven brands do better”. “Up your integrity. Virtue signalling is not enough. Take action with Talenthouse today and democratise creativity” it adds.

However Talenthouse contributors say the company is failing to deliver on its promises. The Observer has spoken to 12 creatives including visual artists a photographer and a scriptwriter who say they have not been paid money they are owed by Talenthouse after completing briefs for companies including DreamWorks Nationwide and Snap.

The group includes creatives in the UK US Poland India and the Philippines. The problems are believed to be more widespread with others describing similar experiences on social media.

One artist Sarah Sumeray 37 from Crouch End London said she has been waiting six months to be paid for a Talenthouse project from March 2022 creating a poster for the animated DreamWorks film The Bad Guys. Sumeray spent three days creating a unique design which she later learned had been selected by DreamWorks. According to Talenthouse’s terms she should have been paid $2000 (£1600) within 90 days.

But the payment window came and went and despite emails showing she repeatedly chased the company she says she has still not been paid. “At this point I’ve given up on getting the money. But it’s so disrespectful to treat hardworking artists like this” she said. “It was quite a big deal to be selected for something like that and it’s quite a chunk of money. It’s just not fair.”

Another UK artist Helen Clamp 39 from Fishponds Bristol responded to a brief posted in August on behalf of Nationwide asking for artists to submit illustrations for use in a social media “money mindfulness” campaign.

Clamp’s design was chosen in October and should have earned her £500 from Talenthouse within 90 days. But she was not paid either. After raising the issue with Nationwide Clamp and others who were selected for the campaign received the money directly from the building society.

While she says Nationwide dealt with her case “really well” she is sharing her story because she believes there is a “bigger problem” with Talenthouse’s payment practices. “I don’t want them to just get away with treating people like this” she said.

Others understood to have been affected by the payment issues include an artist from Poland who is owed €600 which she says is “six months late” an illustrator from Florida who is owed $2000 for a project completed in October 2022 and a script writer from Los Angeles who is owed $2500 for a project completed via Talenthouse which he was supposed to be paid for three months ago. All provided documentary evidence such as emails and contracts to support their claims.

In the Philippines Robert Acle 47 said he is owed $3720 after completing four projects via Talenthouse between April and August 2022 but only receiving payment for two. “The excuses are always the same. They are having some issues with client payments so they’re behind” he said. “We felt exploited and discriminated against and we have no legal means readily available to demand for our right to be paid.”



In emails to creatives Talenthouse has admitted experiencing problems paying artists and has apologised. In one email sent to a creative a company representative said they were “so sorry” the fee had not been paid and that the company had “experienced delays with funding coming in which has in turn put a delay on outgoings”.

But artists have questioned why the company continues to advertise new briefs on its platform. This weekend several projects were live and actively inviting submissions.

In financial statements posted online for investors Talenthouse has claimed to be enjoying strong growth. According to its latest report from November 2022 revenue grew by 29% and gross profit by 64% in the third quarter of 2022 compared with the same period in 2021 driven by a recent acquisition.

The company which is listed on the Six Swiss stock exchange also began new deals which added to its revenue streams including “signing exciting projects with Trivago Razorfish (World Cup video campaign) and several others”. “The number of customers generating over $1m in annual revenue for the company grew considerably in the last two years” the report added.

Zita Holbourne joint chair of the Artists’ Union England said it was “totally unacceptable” that Talenthouse contributors had not been paid. “Artists can’t live off thin air. The work is very precarious as it is and you really need to be paid promptly and on time” she said.

She said the payment problems raised wider ethical concerns about the business models of companies like Talenthouse which rely on artists submitting work speculatively. Those whose work is not selected are not paid. Artists are routinely asked to grant permission for their work to be used at the point when they submit it.

Roman Scharf the co-founder of Talenthouse and chairman of the board said: “We are extremely sorry for this unacceptable delay in payments and any inconvenience and upset it has caused. We take this matter extremely seriously and are working on a long-term robust solution that will benefit all Talenthouse creatives. This solution is well advanced and we plan to announce it soon.”

Nationwide said it had commissioned Talenthouse to help with content for its Instagram feed and that it had “paid upfront for the work”. When it found out artists had not been paid within 90 days as they should have it “took the decision to pay the 11 artists directly … so as not to inconvenience them further”.

A spokesperson for the building society said that working with Talenthouse had enabled it to access artists it might not have found otherwise. It has one outstanding brief with the company and said it would ensure the selected artists were paid on time. “We have no plans to commission any further work with them” they added.

DreamWorks Animation said it was addressing the allegations with Talenthouse. Snap said it was looking into the matter.

There is no suggestion that artists who responded to briefs for other Talenthouse clients have suffered payment problems.

Clamp said she had little sympathy for Talenthouse’s claims about cashflow problems. “An ethical company should be ringfencing the part of their income that is due to go to artists who need to be paid” she said. “From the outside it looks like a legitimate business. But its claim to democratise creativity is a sham.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3RvZGF5LmluL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbmV3cy9zdG9yeS9yZWFsbWUtMTAtcHJvLWNvY2EtY29sYS1lZGl0aW9uLXByZS1vcmRlci1iZWdpbnMtbGF1bmNoLW9uLWZlYnJ1YXJ5LTEwLTM2ODkyMy0yMDIzLTAyLTA00gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJ1c2luZXNzdG9kYXkuaW4vYW1wL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvbmV3cy9zdG9yeS9yZWFsbWUtMTAtcHJvLWNvY2EtY29sYS1lZGl0aW9uLXByZS1vcmRlci1iZWdpbnMtbGF1bmNoLW9uLWZlYnJ1YXJ5LTEwLTM2ODkyMy0yMDIzLTAyLTA0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Realme 10 Pro Coca-Cola edition pre-order begins launch on February 10,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.businesstoday.in', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /technology/news/story/realme-10-pro-coca-cola-edition-pre-order-begins-launch-on-february-10-368923-2023-02-04 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000256254ED7E0>, 'Connection to www.businesstoday.in timed out.

More recently we see the realme 10 Pro getting a special edition version of the phone with the soft drink brand plastered onto it. And according to the company the phone is launching later this week.

The company has shared this on its official Facebook page though based on the promo video the realme 10 Pro Coca-Cola Edition looks a little different compared to the leak we saw before back in January. Though the device from the leak which had an all-red back minus the soft drink branding.

Now this official unveiling shows part of the phone’s back painted black. Granted this is still consistent with what most people would know the brand for as it’s the colour of the drink itself. In fact now it looks quite a bit like the bottled drink.

All that being said the company did not share any specs figures for this Coca-Cola Edition of the realme 10 Pro so it’s probably safe to assume that it’s the same phone with a fancier skin. Though it’s interesting that the brand chose the version without the Plus to be given the makeover.

Going back to the official Facebook post it says that the realme 10 Pro Coca-Cola Edition will be launching on 10 February in India. According to Amanz a realme Malaysia representative has said that the phone will also be launched for the local market. That being said the report was unclear if this means that it will be launched on the same day or at a later date.

The company is also keeping the price of the device under wraps until the device gets its launch event. And judging from the fact that most special edition phones also get a price bump it would be pretty optimistic to hope for a familiar RM1299 price tag.

Cognizant which sacked chief executive Brian Humphries and entrusted S Ravi Kumar as his successor last month expects revenue in the first quarter to be between $4.71 billion and $4.76 billion.

Infosys which posted $4.66 billion in revenue in the October-December period expects to grow between 16% and 16.5% in constant currency terms in the year ended March 2023.

Bengaluru-based Infosys does not give quarterly guidance and only forecasts full-year revenue growth in constant currency terms.

A constant currency term does not take into account the exchange rate fluctuations.

A Bloomberg poll of 18 analysts expects Infosys to report $4.78 billion in revenue in the quarter ended March 2023 which will be more than Cognizant’s upper-end of $4.76 billion in revenue in the same period. Mint reported in January last year that Infosys could pip Cognizant before March 2023 almost a decade after Cognizant raced past Infosys to become the second-largest IT company behind Tata Consultancy Services Ltd in the April-June period of 2012 when Cognizant ended with $1.79 billion in revenue against $1.75 billion in revenue reported by Infosys.

A change in the pecking order underscores the transformation at Infosys undertaken by chairman Nandan Nilekani and chief executive Salil Parekh. It is in contrast with the challenges faced by Cognizant which lagged its peers under former boss Humphries.

Hearteningly for investors of Infosys the company has managed faster growth at higher profitability: Infosys’ operating margin was 21.5% in the December quarter 730 basis points more than Cognizant’s 14.2%.

Faster growth and higher profitability underscore why investors value Infosys more than Cognizant: Infosys’ market capitalization totaled $81 billion against Cognizant’s $36.3 billion as of 2 February.

For now at least one analyst expects Cognizant under Ravi Kumar will take time to rebuild itself.

“We think FY23 represents the start of a long journey for Cognizant to reposition its business for improved growth"" Keith Bachman an analyst with BMO Capital Markets wrote in a note titled “New Long Journey"" dated 3 February after the company declared its earnings

“New leadership wants to make CTSH more competitive in larger deals as well as better manage headcount. Near term we believe CTSH faces both growth and margin headwinds and will continue to underperform peers over the next twelve months"" said Bachman.

Mint earlier reported that Cognizant under new boss Ravi Kumar a former Infosys executive wants to prioritize winning large deals to drive revenue growth boost morale and improve investor sentiment without getting distracted by leadership changes.

On Friday New Jersey-headquartered Cognizant said revenue in the October-December period totaled $4.84 billion a 0.4% sequential decline from the $4.86 billion in the July-September period.

Cognizant which follows January-December financial year has done away with its practice of giving full-year revenue guidance. Cognizant grew 5% to end with $19.43 billion in revenue in 2022.

Cognizant’s operating margin slipped 220 basis points from 16.4% at the end of the September quarter to 14.2% in the fourth quarter primarily because of one-off impairment charges related to one healthcare client.

Cognizant had to incur higher capital prices for servicing a contract from New York-headquartered EmblemHealth Mint reported in its edition dated 20 January when it detailed the reasons why the company sacked Humphries.

Bachman expects Infosys to report $4.75 billion in revenue as against $4.72 billion in revenue by Cognizant in the January-March period also pointed out that Cognizant is re-evaluating its strategy to win more business from its clients in the financial services which accounted for about a third of total business last year.

“Our expectation is that growth is weak for all of CY23 including a continued decline in Financial Services where CTSH is actively reevaluating its strategy. Our initial expectation is for flattish to modest growth in CC for the full-year though with notable uncertainty"" said Bachman in his note.

Significantly Cognizant expecting a sequential decline in business implies that it will be the third straight quarter of revenue decline after it first saw its revenue dip in the July-September period.

TEANECK N.J. Feb. 5 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Cognizant has extended its relationship with Orica a leading manufacturer of commercial explosives and innovative blasting systems to deliver an ESG data strategy and a digital platform through agile methods that provides real-time reporting and forecasting of scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The project is a key component of Orica's Net Zero strategy specifically its AUD37 million (USD27 million) Kooragang Island Decarbonization Project.

As part of the agreement Cognizant will leverage Orica's existing technology investments specifically its Microsoft Azure data lake and provide Orica with a single ESG data platform. This platform is expected to capture and curate Orica's GHG emissions data including structured unstructured and real-time data with the goal of enabling Orica to monitor report and forecast its GHG emissions reductions and track the origination of Australian Carbon Credit Units.

""There is a growing market-driven need for large organizations in the resources industry to understand report on and reduce their carbon footprint. As a major supplier to mining and construction companies Orica also has an important role to play in reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions"" said Chris Crozier Chief Information Officer Orica. ""As such we needed a trusted partner with a similar focus on ESG goals and sustainability and one with an expertise in data analysis AI design and IoT. We look forward to working with Cognizant to help us achieve our own sustainability objectives while we look for ways to support our customers meeting their own goals.""

""Core to our company's purpose of engineering modern businesses to improve everyday life is our commitment to embed sustainability into our thinking decisions and actions. Growing numbers of customers investors regulators and governmental bodies now expect corporations to make measurable progress toward reducing their greenhouse gas emissions"" said Jonathan Smith Sustainability Lead ANZ Cognizant. ""To do so these companies will need to transform their product and technology strategies supply chains logistics models and more. Data is a crucial factor that allows companies to analyze their current emissions and measure against ESG goals over time and we are incredibly proud of having been appointed as the data AI and analytics partner for Orica to be able to measure Orica's ESG efforts to reduce its carbon footprint.""

Orica has installed catalyst abatement technology at its nitric acid production facility at Kooragang Island forecasting a significant reduction in GHG emissions specifically nitrous oxide. The Kooragang Island decarbonization inititiave is forecasted to provide cumulative emission reductions of 4.7 million tonnes of CO2e by 2030. The expected cumulative reduction of this project has been calculated to be equivalent to 1% of Australia's annual carbon footprint or on an annual basis avoiding GHG emissions produced by the equivalent of 35000-50000 Australian homes.

Orica has previously engaged Cognizant to move its IT infrastructure to the cloud to enable Orica to achieve higher levels of efficiency agility and business impact and optimize operating costs.

A growing number have signed onto the U.S. Plastics Pact which pledges to make 100 percent of plastic packaging reusable recyclable or compostable and to see 50 percent of it effectively recycled or composted by 2025.

But for companies that make large numbers of small disposable plastics these pocket-sized objects are a major barrier to realizing their recycling goals.

“Think about items like your toothbrush your travel-size toothpaste tubes your travel-size shampoo bottles” says Alexis Hocken a second-year PhD student in the MIT Department of Chemical Engineering. “They end up actually slipping through the cracks of current recycling infrastructure. So you might put them in your recycling bin at home they might make it all the way to the sorting facility but when it comes down to actually sorting them they never make it into a recycled plastic bale at the very end of the line.”

Now a group of five consumer products companies is working with MIT to develop a sorting process that can keep their smallest plastic products inside the recycling chain. The companies — Colgate-Palmolive Procter & Gamble the Estée Lauder Companies L’Oreal and Haleon — all manufacture a large volume of “small format” plastics or products less than two inches long in at least two dimensions. In a collaboration with Brad Olsen the Alexander and I. Michael Kasser (1960) Professor of Chemical Engineering; Desiree Plata an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering; the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative; and the nonprofit The Sustainability Consortium these companies are seeking a prototype sorting technology to bring to recycling facilities for large-scale testing and commercial development.

Working in Olsen’s lab Hocken is coming to grips with the complexity of the recycling systems involved. Material recovery facilities or MRFs are expected to handle products in any number of shapes sizes and materials and sort them into a pure stream of glass metal paper or plastic. Hocken’s first step in taking on the recycling project was to tour one of these MRFs in Portland Maine with Olsen and Plata.

“We could literally see plastics just falling from the conveyor belts” she says. “Leaving that tour I thought my gosh! There’s so much improvement that can be made. There’s so much impact that we can have on this industry.”

From designing plastics to managing them

Hocken always knew she wanted to work in engineering. Growing up in Scottsdale Arizona she was able to spend time in the workplace with her father an electrical engineer who designs biomedical devices. “Seeing him working as an engineer and how he’s solving these really important problems definitely sparked my interest” she says. “When it came time to begin my undergraduate degree it was a really easy decision to choose engineering after seeing the day-to-day that my dad was doing in his career.”

At Arizona State University she settled on chemical engineering as a major and began working with polymers coming up with combinations of additives for 3D plastics printing that could help fine-tune how the final products behaved. But even working with plastics every day she rarely thought about the implications of her work for the environment.

“And then in the spring of my final year at ASU I took a class about polymers through the lens of sustainability and that really opened my eyes” Hocken remembers. The class was taught by Professor Timothy Long director of the Biodesign Center for Sustainable Macromolecular Materials and Manufacturing and a well-known expert in the field of sustainable plastics. “That first session where he laid out all of the really scary facts surrounding the plastics crisis got me very motivated to look more into that field.”

At MIT the next year Hocken sought out Olsen as her advisor and made plastics sustainability her focus from the start.

“Coming to MIT was my first time venturing outside of the state of Arizona for more than a three-month period” she says. “It’s been really fun. I love living in Cambridge and the Boston area. I love my labmates. Everyone is so supportive whether it’s to give me advice about some science that I’m trying to figure out or just give me a pep talk if I’m feeling a little discouraged.”

A challenge to recycle

A lot of plastics research today is devoted to creating new materials — including biodegradable ones that are easier for natural ecosystems to absorb and highly recyclable ones that hold their properties better after being melted down and recast.

But Hocken also sees a huge need for better ways to handle the plastics we’re already making. “While biodegradable and sustainable polymers represent a very important route and I think they should certainly be further pursued we’re still a ways away from that being a reality universally across all plastic packaging” she says. As long as large volumes of conventional plastic are coming out of factories we’ll need innovative ways to stop it from piling onto the mountain of plastic pollution. In one of her projects Hocken is trying to come up with new uses for recycled plastic that take advantage of its lost strength to produce a useful flexible material similar to rubber.

The small-format recycling project also falls in this category. The companies supporting the project have challenged the MIT team to work with their products exactly as currently manufactured — especially because their competitors use similar packaging materials that will also need to be covered by any solution the MIT team devises.

The challenge is a large one. To kick the project off the participating companies sent the MIT team a wide range of small-format products that need to make it through the sorting process. These include containers for lip balm deodorant pills and shampoo and disposable tools like toothbrushes and flossing picks. “A constraint or problem I foresee is just how variable the shapes are” says Hocken. “A flossing pick versus a toothbrush are very different shapes.”

Nor are they all made of the same kind of plastic. Many are made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET type 1 in the recycling label system) or high-density polyethylene (HDPE type 2) but nearly all of the seven recycling categories are represented among the sample products. The team’s solution will have to handle them all.

Another obstacle is that the sorting process at a large MRF is already very complex and requires a heavy investment in equipment. The waste stream typically goes through a “glass breaker screen” that shatters glass and collects the shards; a series of rotating rubber stars to pull out two-dimensional objects collecting paper and cardboard; a system of magnets and eddy currents to attract or repel different metals; and finally a series of optical sorters that use infrared spectroscopy to identify the various types of plastics then blow them down different chutes with jets of air. MRFs won’t be interested in adopting additional sorters unless they’re inexpensive and easy to fit into this elaborate stream.

“We’re interested in creating something that could be retrofitted into current technology and current infrastructure” Hocken says.

Shared solutions

“Recycling is a really good example of where pre-competitive collaboration is needed” says Jennifer Park collective action manager at The Sustainability Consortium (TSC) who has been working with corporate stakeholders on small format recyclability and helped convene the sponsors of this project and organize their contributions. “Companies manufacturing these products recognize that they cannot shift entire systems on their own. Consistency around what is and is not recyclable is the only way to avoid confusion and drive impact at scale.

“Additionally it is interesting that consumer packaged goods companies are sponsoring this research at MIT which is focused on MRF-level innovations. They’re investing in innovations that they hope will be adopted by the recycling industry to make progress on their own sustainability goals.”

Hocken believes that despite the challenges it’s well worth pursuing a technology that can keep small-format plastics from slipping through MRFs’ fingers.

“These are products that would be more recyclable if they were easier to sort” she says. “The only thing that's different is the size. So you can recycle both your large shampoo bottle and the small travel-size one at home but the small one isn’t guaranteed to make it into a plastic bale at the end. If we can come up with a solution that specifically targets those while they’re still on the sorting line they’re more likely to end up in those plastic bales at the end of the line which can be sold to plastic reclaimers who can then use that material in new products.”

“TSC is really excited about this project and our collaboration with MIT” adds Park. “Our project stakeholders are very dedicated to finding a solution.”

Frosk talks to Peter Pischke via Culturescape / G4 Official Website

In the aftermath of Comcast’s shuttering of their short-lived attempt to revive G4 while her former co-host has taken to throwing bizarre and childish tantrums on social media Indiana “Frosk” Black has chosen to offer insight into the event that heralded its eventual downfall – her now-infamous “sexism in gaming” rant.

The recently retired video game personality opened up about the circumstances which prompted her impassioned explosion in an exclusive interview held with independent journalist Peter Pischke for his newly-launched interview podcast Culturescape.

[Disclosure: Pischke has a working relationship with Bounding Into Comics and is considered a friend by this article’s author.]

Following a discussion of G4’s strategic failings Pischke turned their conversation to the topic of her rant directly asking his guest “What was happening to Frosk that you were in that position where you felt like this needed to be said?”

In turn Frosk revealed that the first embers of her rant were sparked by her experiences “trying to pay attention to everything that was happening online around G4” during a period “fairly early on into its announcement.”

“Over the months leading up to it everywhere I looked if it was on YouTube or Reddit or Twitch every platform people were just talking about how much they used to masturbate to Morgan Webb” she explained. “I was like ‘This is so strange that on social media people are just making all these crude not even just jokes but just really crude statements. What is happening where we’ve missed the barrier to the decision making to think [something] type it out to hit enter and send?’

Shifting her attentions to the Xplay segment in which her anger eventually boiled over Frosk detailed how “it was supposed to be like a ‘New Year’s gripes thing.”

“So we’d be like ‘This thing really annoyed me. In the New Year let’s start fresh and do a New Year’s rant” she told Pischke. “Originally I was supposed to [talk about] Red Dead Redemption 2‘s online I was gonna blast Rockstar and this was even before they decided to just leave [the game’s] online to die.”

However after doing rehearsals – where the onscreen team “wanna keep our rants ‘secretive’ so we don’t record them or do them” – everyone went took a lunch break whereat Frosk’s rant truly began to take form.

“And I go to lunch and I’m sitting with [network producer Emily Rose director Gabrielle Thomas and co-executive producer Megan Lutz] and I don’t remember why it was brought up but the discussion at the table really just kind of turned into our different experiences as women in the industry and also in that specific studio of having really sexist and gross experiences” she recalled.”I was like ‘Why is that so prevalent in this industry?'”

“Like it’s so bizarre” Frosk opined on the matter. “I’ve worked in four different Riot offices – and Riot obviously went through the massive lawsuit about gender discrimination – but just like the s–t that I’ve seen…working ten years in esports I thought that going into mainstream broadcasting would make it better.”

But while she “thought esports was like this ‘Wild West where you don’t have a lot of people with white collar business experience and that it was going to get better going into G4” these issues reportedly only “got so much worse going into G4.”

“Specifically in that studio” she added. “I cannot believe more stuff hasn’t come out.”

Frosk next explained how after that lunch she returned to the studio and decided to change the topic of her rant shifting it from Rockstar’s multiplayer failings to her aggrieved frustrations with her and her co-workers’ personally sexist experiences.

Retracing the chain of events she stated “So I hash out the rant I give it to [Xplay showrunner] Michael Leffler and Megan and they approve it and they’re like ‘Yeah this is great we’re gonna put it in the teleprompter’ and then I read it and that’s what went out.”

“It was approved by all of the higher-ups” Frosk bluntly affirmed.

In a quick aside the former Xplay host noted “Hilariously [Xplay co-host Jirard “The Completionist” Khalil] was actually going to do a very similar rant his was going to be about the general hatred or negativity – I don’t want to put words in his mouth – but kind of like the negativity around the gaming sphere and the audience outputting that.”

“Mine was negativity through the lens of sexism and gaming” she distinguished between their two talks. “And then when Jirard heard mine he was like ‘Well you know you basically talked about a very similar vein of what I was gonna talk about’ so he doesn’t do his.”

RELATED OPINION: Comcast’s G4 Reboot Was Doomed To Fail Long Before Frosk’s ‘Sexism In Gaming’ Rant

Returning to the rant itself Frosk turned to address the decision by G4’s social media team “to clip it and [highlight] it separately.”

“They didn’t like ask me or anything they just went” she asserted revealing that she initially thought little of her ranting because “What 2000 people watched that stream? I was like ‘It’s whatever. That was basically for this audience.'”

However while in true corporate fashion G4 proceeded to “ride the high of – internally everyone’s like ‘good job we really stand behind you!'” Frosk revealed to an intently-listening Pischke that in even more true corporate fashion “As soon as the backlash comes and it gets caught up in the YouTube algorithim all of the harassment comes and G4 just hard bailed.”

“They were like ‘We’re really supporting you but waaaaay over here'” she recalled. “I asked them multiple times “What are your guidelines? How do you wanna handle any of this? There’s no guidelines in terms of social media. I asked them repeatedly for assistance or what they wanted me to say.”

“[In the standards of the public relations world] if that happens what you do is you actually flood the market with more interviews” said Frosk. “So if Comcast wanted to do that correctly if they have this algorithm machine focusing on negativity what you do is actually schedule a s–t ton of interviews and you just 50/50 it.”

“But they just decided to I don’t know completely back away” she sighed.

According to Frosk not only did G4 completely hang her out to dry but they did so in the face of real-world harassment from some of G4’s more unhinged critics.

“It got really bad when I don’t know if it was multiple people – I’m assuming it was probably one person that was using multiple sock puppet account – but there was a stalker scenario” she said of the problems with which she was left to deal with on her own. “I called my local police department to make sure that I didn’t get swatted. the address attached to my LLC – this is how they tried to get it – was actually my agent’s address and his phone number so my agent was getting all of these threatening phone calls and having drive-bys of his house. I had to completely change my LLC to some random PO box.”

“I had this individual who was I’m assuming reverse image searching the pictures I put on my social media and kept messaging me trying to get my location” she continued. “Weird shit like that.”

“I decided to delete my entire Twitter to make sure that there weren’t images that could be used – I just cleared the entire thing out” Frosk stated. “I felt like anything that I did then the YouTubers were reporting on it. I was like ‘Dudes I don’t even know how to explain to you the levels of deep weirdness this is!'”

“So that sucked and it was definitely like a lowpoint but outside of that it was business as usual” she concluded. “I stopped really using a lot of social media didn’t go on YouTube at all – I couldn’t go on YouTube anywhere – and I tried to focus on work.”

Taking advantage of the opportunity to vent against her former employer Frosk then surprised Pischke with the brief story of how a producer on the network’s Attack of the Show “said at the office in front of other people ‘the reason that Xplay is failing is because they don’t have any hot people like Morgan Webb on their show’.”

“He literally said that” she affirmed.

Ultimately Frosk admitted “If they had asked me I would’ve said ‘Do not clip that.'”

“Did I care?” she reflected. “It’s hard. Did I mean everything that I said? Yeah but that’s in a context of like I know only 2000 people are watching and I can look directly at the Twitch chat. It was in the context of the rest of the show.”

“You have a minute and a half to get this segment in on a 2000 viewer stream” Frosk ultimately shrugged her shoulders on the topic. “Different content would’ve been repurposed for different things.”

Those who like a little heat in their salted snacks might be familiar with Andy Capp's Hot Fries. For anyone who has never grabbed a bag of these crispy sticks the brand's website describes them as a potato chip alternative. Though Hot Fries may be one of the better-known members of Andy Capp's lineup there are other flavors such as ranch cheddar and BBQ. According to Candy Retailor the cheddar version could make a good sandwich pairing. (And for folks who use chips to ""crunchify"" burgers ala Bobby Flay and Sunny Anderson perhaps snack fries could serve as a crunchy substitute.)

All of Andy Capp's products are recognizable from the packaging featuring a cartoon man outfitted in a red plaid driving cap.

The Windy City is going big on solar to meet sustainability goals.

Mayor Lori Lightfoot announced on Aug. 8 that Chicago plans to run all operations with renewable energy by 2025 making it one one of the largest cities in the country to do so.

The city signed an energy supply agreement valued up to $422 million with retail electricity supplier Constellation in collaboration with Swift Current Energy to purchase renewable energy like solar and wind power for all city-run buildings like airports libraries and water treatment plants.

The agreement states that part of the energy used to run these large government facilities will come from a new solar power installation being developed and built this year.

The Double Black Diamond Solar Installation which is set to start construction before the end of 2022 is expected to be one of the largest solar projects in Illinois to date and will create hundreds of jobs in the state according to the mayor's office.

To power smaller buildings and street lamps the city plans to purchase renewable energy credits from other sources.

This deal exists within a larger push towards sustainability in Chicago. The 2022 Chicago Climate Action Plan is aiming for a 62% reduction in harmful carbon pollution by 2040 through direct action and investment from the city.

The plan is formed around four main goals: improving community health increasing household savings advancing environmental justice and reducing carbon pollution.

Chicago is working towards retrofitting buildings to make them more energy efficient and plans for the city's bus fleet to be 100% electric by 2040.

Reducing the amount of planet-warming gas that's released into the atmosphere is essential for avoiding the worst effects of climate change like extreme weather events that can devastate our communities –– and the benefits of this ambitious plan won't just be felt in Chicago.

Board Chairman of Sangamon County Andy Van Meter said that the Double Black Diamond Solar installation ""... will employ hundreds of construction workers and directly create permanent high paying positions"" in a press release. He added that it will also ""create a significant long-term source of tax revenue for [Illinois'] schools and community.""

Jim McHugh the Chief Commercial Officer for Constellation added ""It is especially important that we help underserved and under-resourced communities participate in the transition to a carbon free future.""

Following that spirit Constellation and Swift have financially committed to pay for the development of a diverse sustainability-focused workforce through job training apprenticeships and educational programs.

The energy industry's efforts follow in the footsteps of the Chicago Urban League which aims to advance economic equity by ""preparing people from underserved communities for in-demand jobs."" The League offers programs like its solar panel installation training which has served over 200 people.

As the third largest city in the country Chicago is setting a great example for urban centers that haven't yet made similar clean energy investments or pledges.

In 2020 less than half of large cities in the U.S. had set planet-overheating gas reduction goals. This coupled with a lack of accessible emissions data and the worrying finding that many U.S. cities under-report their pollution rates means that there's still so much work to do before all of our cities are sustainable.

Chicago's plan to fully power public operations with renewable energy in the next few years is a great step.

But in Chicago a rare case of cooperation could be emerging.

A developer controlling several parcels along three of Chicago’s wealthiest neighborhoods wants to buy air rights controlling space above a property from nearby residential and commercial property owners in a deal that could lead to a tower by well-known architect David Adjaye.

It’s not uncommon for developers to buy air rights from neighboring property owners a move that allows builders to add height and density to new projects. Air rights above an existing structure can be transferred to an adjacent property if there is unused zoning density or floor area ratio on the site.

Chicago-based developer Fern Hill’s approach is to fold air rights and greater density on one site into a broader development agreement for several parcels. Once air rights are sold by a building owner the height of buildings allowed on that site is forever capped.

Creating a master plan with height-limit guarantees would protect nearby condo towers’ lake views and limit the creation of new towers in the immediate area to the single site company founder Nick Anderson said in an interview with CoStar News. It could also help preserve 19th-century buildings he said.

“It’s a nontraditional process different from ‘How can I maximize the value of my site?’ This is a way to address the needs of the neighborhood as it’s grown organically over the past several decades” Anderson said. “We want to allow the neighborhood to develop and grow while also maximizing the community benefit.”

The owners would have to agree to height limitations on most of the parcels in exchange for community support for the tower as the centerpiece of a long-planned North Side project. Fern Hill is pitching the proposal to neighbors as it seeks backing for its master plan on high-profile land along the Old Town Lincoln Park and Gold Coast neighborhoods not far from the city’s largest park and Lake Michigan.

There's no guarantee any agreement could be reached and when dealing with multiple parties various factions can develop making a successful project more difficult.

Working With Residents

Even so a meeting was held between the developers and neighbors Thursday hosted by 2nd Ward Alderman Brian Hopkins. He has yet to take a stance on backing the project which ultimately would require zoning approval from the full City Council.

In an unusual approach to the city’s zoning approval process in which developers meet with community groups after drawing up specific site plans and renderings Fern Hill publicly launched the project in 2021 as a blank slate asking residents what the neighborhood needs.

Residents have indicated that high priorities included bringing in a new grocery tenant for the former Treasure Island grocery building on Wells Street a property Fern Hill owns as well as other amenities such as outdoor space and a more walkable neighborhood Fern Hill said. Responses indicated some opposition to more tall buildings in an area north of the Loop business district that has a mix of residential towers with views of the lake and low-rise residential and retail buildings.

The area includes longtime institutions such as The Moody Church which plans to sell some land and air rights to Fern Hill as well as the Chicago History Museum the Latin School of Chicago and the Second City comedy club.

Fern Hill already owns the former grocery on Wells and two gas stations along opposite sides of the church.

Anderson a former Related Midwest executive said he is focused on consolidating most of the development’s height and density onto a single site a parking lot at the northwest corner of LaSalle Street and North Avenue owned by the church located across the street.

By doing so the developer could increase construction height on the surface lot while providing guarantees that it would not later seek vertical redevelopment of sites such as the gas stations — where heights would forever be limited to 50 feet — and the grocery store where it is seeking out a new grocery tenant.

No Plans Drawn

Anderson declined to say how tall a tower Fern Hill envisions for the site.

He said London-based Adjaye — who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2017 and whose projects throughout the world have included the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington D.C. and the 66-story 130 William residential tower in Manhattan — has not drawn up a specific design for the site.

The height and design will depend on how many neighboring property owners want to sell air rights or otherwise back the project Anderson said.

Transferring zoning density to Fern Hill would increase the value of the the firm’s project on the parking lot while reducing the amount developers might be willing to pay for low-rise buildings that they want to demolish and replace with taller structures.

But such deals would remove the financial incentive for property owners to sell historic 1800s-era buildings to developers allowing residents and businesses to stay for the long term while preserving the neighborhood’s character Anderson said.

“By working with owners like that we can incorporate any unused air rights so that they don’t ever have to tear down their buildings” Anderson said. “The value has already been maximized without tearing down their buildings. This is a neighborhood that’s been around and developed over since the 1850s.""

He added that ""these really cool buildings that surround this important intersection are small. Once the land becomes worth more than the building you are now in a preservation battle. That doesn’t have to happen here.”

Without a master plan in place sites such as the gas stations will undergo separate zoning approval processes as they’re redeveloped over time Anderson said.

Following the meeting Anderson said the firm will spend a few months meeting with neighbors and coming up with formal plans to present to the community.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvc3Rhci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8xMjAxNjE0MDM3L2FtYXpvbi10by1jbG9zZS1zb21lLWZyZXNoLXN1cGVybWFya2V0cy1zdG9wLWV4cGFuc2lvbi1vZi1zdGFydHVwLWdyb2NlcnktY2hhaW7SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Amazon To Close Some Fresh Supermarkets Stop Expansion of Startup Grocery Chain,"E-commerce juggernaut Amazon is once again pulling back on its brick-and-mortar expansion shuttering some of its Amazon Fresh supermarkets and halting the chain's rollout as well as closing a number of Amazon Go convenience stores.

The Seattle-based online giant discussed curtailing its foray into the competitive and low-margin grocery sector during a fourth-quarter earnings call Thursday where the company reported results far behind the growth it enjoyed during the pandemic and shortly after it. And it's been cost-cutting as a result with layoffs a slowdown in industrial growth as well as store closings.

Both Amazon Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky and CEO Andy Jassy discussed Amazon Fresh Amazon's fledgling startup grocery chain and Amazon Go its cashierless stores. And they said the Fresh concept needs refining.

""We're continuously refining our store formats to find the ones that will resonate with customers will build our grocery brand and will allow us to scale meaningfully over time"" Olsavsky told Wall Street analysts. ""As such we periodically access our portfolio of stores and decided to exit certain stores with low growth potential. We'll also take an impairment on capitalized costs and associated values of our leased buildings. ... We continue to believe grocery is a significant opportunity and we're focused on serving customers through multiple channels whether that's online delivery pickup or in-store shopping.""

As a result of the Amazon Fresh and Amazon Go closings Amazon took a $720 million impairment charge — relating to property equipment and operating leases — in the fourth quarter according to Olsavsky.

The company which acquired the Whole Foods Market chain for $13.7 billion in 2017 has faltered in its own ventures into the brick-and-mortar retail segment and been paring back its physical footprint. In March last year the company pulled the plug on 68 stores representing three chains namely its Amazon 4-star Amazon Pop Up and Amazon Books locations in the United States and Great Britain.

Trying To Stand Out

""Amazon has always been willing to try new concepts and gives their teams the resources to go for it"" Bill Read executive vice president at Retail Specialists said in an email to CoStar News on Friday. ""Unfortunately not many of the retail ventures have proven to be successful and Amazon is not willing to lose money on operations for a extended period. Grocery is a low-margin business and they gave it a really good effort. Pausing expansion and examining the concept is a prudent step.""

On the earnings call Jassy spoke at length about Amazon Fresh and the supermarket business. There are 44 Fresh stores now according to the company website.

""I'd just start by saying that we think grocery is a really important and strategic area for us"" he said. ""It's a very large market segment and there's a lot of frequency in how consumers shop for grocery.""

Whole Foods differentiates itself by offering the ""best organic physical store experience and selection"" according to Jassy and Amazon Fresh needs to find a way to stand out as well.

""And that's what we've been working on with Amazon Fresh and we have a few dozen stores so far"" he said. ""We're doing a fair bit of experimentation today in those stores to try to find a format that we think resonates with customers it's differentiated in some meaningful fashion and where we like the economics. And we've been we've decided over the last year or so that we're not going to expand the physical Fresh doors until we have that equation with differentiation and economic value that we like but we're optimistic that we're going to find that in 2023.""

Jassy added ""We see some encouraging signs. And when we do find that equation we will expand it more expansively. But I think that we have a very significant opportunity in the grocery segment.""

Evolution of Startup Grocer

The first Amazon Fresh store in debuted in Woodland Hills California in August 2020. The chain pushed into the Northeast with openings in Paramus New Jersey and Oceanside New York last year.

Neil Saunders managing director of GlobalData issued a note on Amazon's results.

""Looking in more detail at the fourth quarter overall sales rose by 8.6%"" he said. ""This looks reasonable enough but it is the slowest final quarter growth in over 10 years.""

According to Saunders ""In a nutshell the current problem for Amazon is that it spent most of the pandemic driving with its foot to the floor to keep up with demand but as demand dropped back it did not apply the brakes fast enough. The net result is that it has veered off course and had a bit of a financial crash. Management has spent most of the past year trying to make repairs in the form of reining in spending but the actions were not sufficient to save the quarter or the fiscal year.""

In a tough slowed-down economic environment Amazon needs to be more ""targeted with its growth ambitions"" Saunders said.

""Since its inception Amazon has had a culture of throwing dollars at many different things to see where they led and what they could learn"" he said. ""That approach worked well for a younger fast-growth business. It works far less successfully for a more mature entity. In our view management deserves credit for recognizing this and quickly responding. However the shift requires a lot of care because Amazon needs to find a new balance between being ambitious and innovative and being more frugal with its spending which will be very challenging.""",,,,,,,,,

Costco is the third-largest retailer in the United States trailing only Walmart and Amazon (via National Retail Federation). And yet the wholesale warehouse brand still manages to feel like an exclusive club. There's something about flashing your membership card and copping a whole rotisserie chicken for less than five bucks that makes you feel special — almost like you're getting away with something. Weirdly enough despite the vast scale of its stores Costco doesn't offer a very wide selection of items compared to its competitors. According to Britannica the average Costco location only carries one-tenth of the variety you'd find in most supermarkets. But variety isn't really the point when you're shopping at Costco. The bargain prices are the real draw.

One of the main keys to Costco's low prices (and limited variety) is the fact that most of its products are sold under the Kirkland Signature brand. According to CNN Business store brands like Kirkland typically offer goods for 10% to 50% less than name-brand competitors. But these store brands have a dirty little secret. The reason they seem so similar to name brands is that they are the same brands. Most stores are secretive about their sources but CNN reveals that Kirkland diapers are actually made by Huggies and the batteries are Duracell. These days retailers have more power than suppliers so they call the shots but Costco's dominion over its labels almost took a different route. How popular would they be if Kirkland had never become Kirkland?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBhcmVudHMuY29tL2Z1bi92YWNhdGlvbi90cmF2ZWxpbmctd2l0aC1raWRzL2hvdy10by1zYXZlLW9uLWRpc25leS10cmF2ZWwtd2hlbi1ib29raW5nLXdpdGgtY29zdGNvLXRyYXZlbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to Save Money by Booking Disney Travel With Costco,"A Disney vacation can be a truly memorable experience for your children but it's certainly not one of the most budget-friendly family adventures you'll ever embark on. Thankfully there are ways to make this type of vacation slightly more affordable (or at least more value-oriented.)

Among the options is booking your family's Disney vacation through Costco Travel a division of the big-box wholesale store. Costco Travel Assistant Vice President Chris Hendrix tells Parents that the company aims to offer convenient one-stop shopping for all Disney travel needs.

To that end Costco Travel offers vacation packages to Walt Disney World and Disneyland that include both hotels and tickets. Costco Travel also arranges packages to Disney's luxe Aulani Resort in Hawaii as well as guided vacations with Adventures by Disney and getaways with Disney Cruise Line.

Those who have gone the Costco route before likely already know there are a variety of perks for Costco members who book their Disney travel through the wholesale club—including receiving special savings on various incidental costs associated with a Disney visit as well as a few special value-added features thrown in by the discount giant.

""Booking a Disney vacation package through Costco can come with some great benefits including breakfast resort credits upgrades and waived resort fees depending on the hotel you chose"" says Chris Hassan a family travel writer for UpgradedPoints. ""This can represent huge savings for a family over the course of a week.""

However there are some considerations you should make before booking. Here are the pros and cons of booking a Disney vacation with Costco.

4 Pros of a Disney Vacation with Costco

1. You can score free Disney gift cards

One of the most frequently cited perks associated with booking Disneyland Resort packages through Costco are the gift cards that Costco throws in as a special added benefit for members.

Here's how it works according to Costco: Members who book a multi-day vacation package at a Disneyland onsite resort receive a Disney gift card for up to $245 (one per package—exact value depends on the length of vacation booked). The gift card can be used to pay for Disney shopping and dining including the wildly popular character dining. This perk even extends to those who book stays at some offsite hotels or ""Good Neighbor"" hotels as Costco calls them. Members who book a multi-day package at a Good Neighbor hotel receive a $145 Disney gift card.

""The Disney gift cards with Costco packages are a great way of helping you splurge on your trip allowing you to do something you wouldn't normally want to budget for. Perhaps that means buying a special souvenir or maybe giving you the chance to book a character meal"" Kimberly Tate founder of Stuffed Suitcase and also the Vacation Mavens podcast tells Parents.

Costco members can also receive extra savings at select Downtown Disney District dining and shopping locations says Hendrix.

2. Other trips = Disney shop cards

Slightly different than the gift cards Costco provides shop cards to those who book vacations through Costco Travel for Aulani Disney Cruise Line and Adventures by Disney. The exact amount of the card varies based upon the trip booked and the length of stay (or sailing). The value of the shop card is calculated during the booking process Michelle Rupp a buyer for Costco Travel tells Parents.

""The card is sent to the Costco members about 2 to 4 weeks after they return from their vacation or cruise and may be used toward merchandise or gas at any Costco warehouse throughout the United States or Canada"" says Rupp.

3. Enjoy complimentary parking

All of Costco's Walt Disney World Resort on-site packages include complimentary parking at all Walt Disney World theme parks and at Disney Springs.

""We have also negotiated with some of the off-site hotels to include in our packages complimentary parking at the hotel"" says Rupp. Examples on this front include Hilton Orlando Buena Vista Palace Melia Orlando Celebration and Sheraton Vistana Resort Villas to name a few.

""This can save you money if you're planning to drive to the parks instead of using the resort transportation"" says Tate.

4. Nab discounts by bundling

For both Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World packages booked through Costco include both hotel accommodations and park tickets. Combining these items together provides booking convenience for travelers and additional savings says Costco's Rupp.

""Regardless of the type of [park entrance] ticket included in the package Costco members receive extra savings on the bundled package…The longer the admission days of the tickets (up to 10 days) the deeper the discount"" explains Rupp.

4 Cons to Consider

Summer Hull editorial director for The Points Guy says booking Disney vacations through Costco Travel can definitely be cheaper than booking elsewhere but there are limitations to who might benefit. Here are some potential drawbacks to consider.

1. Short trips may not benefit

""I've seen Disney vacations booked through Costco Travel be as much as $1000 cheaper— even for a medium-priced fam vacation to Disney "" Hull tells Parents. ""The catch is you can only book stays three days or longer with them. So if you're going for just a weekend it doesn't work.""

2. You may lose some direct Disney access

Hull says that booking a Disney vacation through a third party can sometimes complicate life when there's a problem or issue that needs to be addressed.

""Sometimes Disney is not able to help as much when you're adding a third-party player to that equation"" continues Hull who says that if she's not booking a vacation directly with Disney she generally opts for a vacation planner that specializes in Disney such as Mouse Counselors.

Disney vacation planners will do everything from getting you dining reservations to waking up early to book Disney fast passes for you—so that you can simply relax and enjoy your getaway. The beauty of this type of service is that it doesn't cost you a dime. Planners work on commission and are not paid by the person booking the vacation.

""They eliminate a lot of hassle"" explains Hull. ""There are a million of these planners out there and typically none of them add any additional cost. They wake up early and handle all of those annoying things you don't want to deal with. And if my plans change for some reason they will be the ones on hold with Disney not me.""

Still adds Hull for someone who's simply chasing the cheapest option for a Disney visit and who is also visiting (or sailing) for at least three days Costco can certainly be worth it.

3. There could be airline limitations

One last drawback to consider is that Costco does not work with every airline so if you prefer to fly certain carriers (such as JetBlue or Spirit) you may be out of luck says Hassan of UpgradedPoints. And as always when booking through a travel agency you won't earn any points or elite nights for your hotel stays.

The bottom line? If you plan to make the most of all the perks offered by Costco it can definitely be a solid option for busy families who are seeking to save money.

""Just be sure to look at the included benefits carefully—and make sure that you will be able to use them"" says Hassan.

4. You need to be a Costco member

Last but not least you will need a Costco membership in order to book any sort of travel through Costo. A basic membership is $60/year while an executive membership is $120. Once you're a Costco member however you can use your membership to shop both in-store and online and even earn rewards points on booked travel if you get a Costco card too.

You guessed it: Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique! If you’re unsure what Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique is it’s a magically immersive experience in which children ages 3-12 can be transformed into a princess or knight by one of the Fairy God Mother’s Apprentices. These makeovers typically take up to one hour and include hair styling makeup nail polish and lots of glitter! You can also choose a package that includes a beautiful princess or knight costume that comes with a few coordinating accessories.

Currently Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique’s only open location in Disney World is in Magic Kingdom. Although the Boutique is open daily from 8:00AM to park closing you must book an appointment in advance. It’s recommended that you do this as far in advance as possible as slots fill up VERY quickly!

With the start of a new year Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique has announced all of the new things coming to this magical experience in 2023 including new hairstyles dresses and makeup! All this information can be super overwhelming so we’re making some posts to hopefully make things a bit easier starting with all the beautiful dresses available in 2023! We’ll also outline the different packages and their prices as well as how you can prepare for your appointment.

Package Options and Prices

There are tons of package options to choose from at Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique! Each one of them is just as magical and the best part is that there is a package for every budget.

The Carriage Package

This is the most basic package offering at Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique! We’ve seen tons of guests choose this package on hotter days when a costume might be too hot or for little ones who might get uncomfortable or overstimulated from walking around in a bulky costume all day!

Hairstyling

Makeup (lots of sparkles) and a face gem

Princess sash and cinch sack

Nail polish

Disney Princess gown (no shoes included)

Additional coordinating accessories based on gown choice

The Deluxe Castle Package

The Deluxe Castle Package starts at $229.95 plus tax and includes:

Hairstyling

Sparkly makeup and face gem

Princess necklace sash and cinch sack

Nail polish

Deluxe Disney Princess gown of choice (shoes not included)

Coordinating boxed accessory set

The Disney Encanto Package

Previously guests could get a Frozen makeover that included braids to resemble Elsa and Anna’s. That package has recently been replaced with this one which features accessories and outfits like Mirabel’s and Isabela’s!

The Encanto Package starts at $179.95 plus tax and includes:

Hairstyling

Sparkly makeup and face gem

Princess sash and cinch bag

Mirabel or Isabela gown (shoes not included)

The Knight Package starts at $19.95 plus tax and includes:

Hairstyling with gel

Mighty sword and shield

The Deluxe Knight Package

This one is very similar to the Knight Package but includes a costume!

Hairstyling with gel

Mighty sword and shield

You’ll be able to select your package option at booking so that you aren’t overwhelmed by all the options and information when you arrive!

So you’ve booked your appointment. Now it’s time to prepare!

Preparing for Your Appointment

Before your appointment ensure that your princess or knight arrives with clean brushed hair clean skin and clean nails. This makes the job of the Fairy Godmother’s Apprentices much easier! We recommend booking an appointment as early in the day as possible to ensure that your little one doesn’t have time to get sweaty and messy in the parks. (Trust us we know how that is. One snack and they’re sticky for the rest of the day. We know.)

Dress Options

Although the dresses available vary on current demand you can generally expect an impressive array of princess gowns. On most days you can find dresses that resemble those of these princesses:

Anna

Elsa

Ariel

Snow White

Aurora

Belle

Jasmine

Cinderella

Tinker Bell

Tiana

Rapunzel

Merida

You can also get Mirabel and Isabela dresses as well included in the Encanto package! These dresses also come with accessories similar to those worn by Mirabel and Isabela in the movie.

While there are no guarantees that they’ll have the dress you’re looking for they typically do have a decent selection. Once again we recommend going as early in the day as possible so that you’ll get the first pick of what’s available that day!

If you’re planning a visit to Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique on your next trip it’s worth noting that you MUST have a Magic Kingdom park reservation for the day of your visit — the price of which is not included in your Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique package. We recommend booking far enough in advance that when you find an opening at Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique you can easily find open Magic Kingdom park reservations for that day as well.

Here at AllEars we’re always on the lookout for news and updates that will help make your next Disney trip even more magical! Stay tuned for more news and updates including snack reviews the best resorts and our favorite merch!

Chail appeared at London's Central Criminal Court by video link from Broadmoor a secure psychiatric hospital where he is detained. He is due to be sentenced on March 31 after the judge assesses psychiatric reports.

Chail was arrested at the royal residence west of London on December 25 2021 when the queen was staying there. The monarch died in September 2022 at age 96.

Prosecutors say the former supermarket worker from the southern English city of Southampton scaled a wall with a rope ladder and entered the castle grounds wearing a metal mask and carrying a loaded crossbow with the safety catch off.

They say he told a police officer ""I am here to kill the queen"" before he was handcuffed and arrested.

Police say Chail wanted revenge on the British establishment for its treatment of Indians and sent a video to a group of contacts ""stating his desire to harm the late queen.""

He had previously tried to join the British Army and the Ministry of Defence Police to get close to the royal family prosecutors allege.

Commander Richard Smith of the Metropolitan Police Counterterrorism Command said ""this was an extremely serious incident.""

He said officers patrolling the castle grounds ""showed tremendous bravery to confront a masked man who was armed with a loaded crossbow and then detain him without anyone coming to harm.""

Charges under the Treason Act of 1842 are rare. In 1981 Marcus Sarjeant was charged under the act after firing blank shots at the queen as she rode on horseback in the Trooping the Color parade in London. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to five years in prison.

The last person to be convicted under the separate and more serious Treason Act of 1351 was William Joyce a World War II Nazi propaganda broadcaster known as Lord Haw-Haw. He was hanged for high treason in 1946.",,,,,,

Cambodian investors are likely already familiar with “corporate bonds” a type of debt securities already introduced into the Kingdom’s market.

However another type of debt securities has only recently been initiated into the country’s securities market at the end of 2022 – “government bonds”.

So what are government bonds? What are the differences compared to corporate bonds? And why should investors look into this particular investment instrument?

What are government bonds?

Government bonds are a type of debt instrument whereby investors loan their money to the government in return for a regular fixed interest payment based on the coupon rate set by each bond.

Moreover government bonds carry the legal responsibility of returning the bondholder’s principal amount at the conclusion of the maturity period.

Funds raised through this investment instrument will be used on various development projects that align with the Royal Government’s strategic plans.

Cambodian government bonds

Government bonds are currently issued by the Ministry of Economy and Finance representing the Cambodian government to develop the Kingdom’s financial sector and diversify sources of funding to support the country’s development needs.

Government bonds are issued by the Ministry of Economy and Finance. Hong Menea

In 2022 the government approved the Government Bond Issuance Plan for the first year with a total of 1.2 trillion riel or US$300 million with the first historical issuance taking place on September 9 2022.

With the Government Bond Issuance occurring near the end of 2022 the Royal Government of Cambodia has managed to successfully organise three issuances raising capital of approximately 72 billion riel or $18 million.

In spite of the less than ideal result the government has set out a Government Bond Issuance Plan for 2023 with a total target issuance of 813 billion riel or $200 million.

Based on the experience of Government Bond issuance in 2022 and the introduction of new strategies this year the government of Cambodia is optimistic that the new Government Bond Issuance Plan 2023 is achievable.

Primary market

The existing issuances of government bonds were completed through auctions that took place at the National Bank of Cambodia through the “National Bank of Cambodia Auction Platform” (NBCP).

However the Cambodian government plans to increase the issuance of government bonds in the primary market this year through private placements and auctions using the “Government Securities Auction Platform” (GSAP).

GSAP is a soon-to-be-launched platform developed by the Cambodia Securities Exchange (CSX) in addition to the NBCP with both auction platforms putting emphasis on different maturity periods.

Both government bond auction platforms allow various potential investors to enter the market directly including commercial banks and microfinance institutions securities firms insurance companies the National Social Security Fund fund managers and custodians as well as other investors and institutions in accordance with the government’s issuance plan.

Secondary market

With the secondary market for the trading of government bonds still in development securities listed on the CSX are yet to be offered for trading. However the secondary mar-ket is set to launch this year.

Advantages

There are a number of benefits for investing in government bonds including:

Low risk

Government bonds are known to have the lowest risk – almost zero – strictly because they are backed by a country’s government.

It is therefore highly unlikely for interest payments and principal repayments to be defaulted on with government bonds.

A functioning government will always have adequate funds to meet payment promises to compensate bondholders with interest and principal payback.

However it should be noted that due to the lower risk it also means a lower rate of return compared to corporate bonds.

Steady returns

Akin to bank investment government bonds allow investors to earn steady returns based on regular interest payments.

All government bonds come with a coupon rate providing periodic interest amounts at regular intervals to bondholders.

Portfolio diversification

Government bonds enable investors to spread their investment assets and reduce reliance on a single class of asset.

With government bonds generally a secure investment they serve as a kind of backup allowing investors to allocate a remainder of their savings on securities and assets with higher risk to balance their portfolio.

This is especially useful for financial institutions such as insurance companies and banks for lowering the risk of negative returns and bankruptcy.

National development

As the key word “government” makes clear this particular instrument plays a major role in the development of the nation. The creation of a government bond market brings the following national benefits:

Government funding

Capital raised from the issuance of government bonds will be used to directly fund Cambodian government development projects and public services and serve as a stimulus for the growth of the national economy.

Each government bond has a clearly defined objective such as for economic development or improvements to social infrastructure.

As a result the people of Cambodia may show their interest and participate directly with the kind of development they wish to see in the foreseeable future.

Monetary policy

Government bonds act as a key tool for the implementation of monetary policy in Cambodia. For instance the central bank can purchase government bonds to increase the supply of money in the economy and lower interest rates.

Conversely government bonds can also be sold back by the central bank to reduce the amount of money in circulation and increase interest rates.

This economic instrument along with other monetary policy will play an important role in governing Cambodia’s overall GDP growth money supply interest rates and inflation as well as with price stability across the country.

Benchmarks

A benchmark bond is a standard measure of a bond’s risk and return against which other bonds are benchmarked.

Government bonds are used across the globe almost always as benchmark bonds due to their high rating and liquidity.

This means the success of the bond market in each country is reflected in its government bond listings. The development of this new product helps complement the infrastructure of the Cambodian financial market ensuring it is more complete and comprehensive.

Government bonds are regarded as one of the safest financial instruments on the market as they allow investors to offset losses in other asset classes through regular interest payments.

Being backed by the government this kind of instrument provides guaranteed interest and repayments of principal and can be used as an effective complement to a base portfolio. In Cambodia’s case investors also directly contribute to the government’s development plans.

Among all the remarkable things about Pat Cummins  the most remarkable could be his durability. In an era when other world-class genuinely quick bowlers - think Jofra Archer or Jasprit Bumrah - routinely miss matches and series for injury or workload-management reasons Cummins is almost always part of Australia's Test XIs. He has featured in 46 of Australia's last 50 Tests  and only Nathan Lyon (50) has been more of an ever-present.

It wasn't always so of course. Cummins the Player of the Match on Test debut in November 2011 waited five-and-a-half injury-ravaged years before getting to play Test cricket again.

In March 2017 he made his comeback in Ranchi and proceeded to show the world just how special a talent he was. Figures of 39-10-106-4 aren't immediately eye-catching perhaps but that performance was exceptional for two reasons.

The first reason was what Cummins brought up when asked about Ranchi on Saturday in Australia's first press conference since landing in India for the four-Test Border-Gavaskar series which begins in Nagpur on February 9.

Cummins had only played one first-class game in the 18 months leading up to that game in Ranchi and given his injury history no one could have been certain how much of a workload he could get through. As it turned out he bowled 39 overs as India piled up 603 for 9 declared. To date he hasn't bowled more overs in a Test innings.

""I think what I learned about myself was it was my first Test match in six years it kind of reaffirmed that that's where I wanted to be"" Cummins said ""and in Test cricket you can't be worried about your body or different things you've just got to go all-in. I really enjoyed that.

""I think also the lesson there is that Test cricket can be really really hard. You've got to accept that it's going to be a grind sometimes and you have got to be up for it and embrace that challenge. I think coming here to India a lot of the talk is around big spinning wickets mainly fast [-moving] Test matches but it's not always the case.

""You need to get into the grind at times and that role as a fast bowler might be bowling plenty of overs for not a heap of reward but doing a job for the team. I really enjoyed that aspect of that last tour.""

""We have got plenty of bowling options here - fingerspin wristspin left-arm [spin] and Starcy [Mitchell Starc] when he comes back"" Pat Cummins is relying on the variety of his attack to pick 20 wickets

The second thing that made that Ranchi display so remarkable was that on a track that was slow low and utterly lifeless when any of Australia's other bowlers tried their luck on it Cummins threatened to run through India. By means of searing pace conventional swing with the second new ball reverse with the old one and offcutter-bouncers that reared at the gloves he had at one stage taken four wickets to leave India six down and trailing Australia's first-innings total by 123.

Cheteshwar Pujara and Wriddhiman Saha turned the match around thereafter putting India in control with a 199-run seventh-wicket stand but Cummins had shown Australia how he had both the stamina and the sting to be a threat on subcontinental pitches.

Australia recognise that pace could play as crucial a role as spin in their push for a first Test-series win in India since 2004 - their two best bowlers in that series were Jason Gillespie (20 wickets at 16.15) and Glenn McGrath (14 at 25.42) - and the attacks that led them to victories in Bengaluru and Nagpur featured three quicks and one spinner.

While a lot of the pre-series talk this time has revolved around who among Ashton Agar Mitchell Swepson and Todd Murphy will partner Lyon in Australia's spin attack Cummins suggested that three quicks and one spinner could be an option too.

""I wouldn't say [two spinners is] a given"" he said. ""Obviously it's very conditions-dependent particularly in the first Test. Once we get to Nagpur we will see. But yeah I think sometimes talking about a couple of spinners you forget how good a lot of our fast bowlers have been in all conditions.

""You know even some of the SCG wickets [there hasn't] been a lot in it for the quick bowlers but the quick bowlers have found a way. So yeah we've got plenty of bowling options here - fingerspin wristspin left-arm [spin] and Starcy [Mitchell Starc] when he comes back down the line. So yeah we've obviously picked the bowlers that we think can take 20 wickets. How we are going to split that up we are not 100% sure yet.""

Australia's most recent Test match against South Africa in January came on one of the SCG pitches Cummins referenced flat and slow. Rain dashed Australia's hopes of forcing a win but Cummins put them in a position to push for that result summoning every weapon at his disposal including bouncers from around the wicket with a leg-theory field to dismiss three of South Africa's top six and force them to follow on.

Cummins had bowled with similar hostility in Lahore last year picking up five wickets in the first innings and three in the second as Australia wrapped up a series victory their bowlers had worked tirelessly for on some of the flattest Test pitches of recent times.

Cummins wasn't just tireless though. In a series where the next-best Australia bowler averaged 34.12 he took 12 wickets at 22.50 . On pitches designed to blunt his wicket-taking threat he was both tireless and incisive.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLm5kdHYuY29tL2NyaWNrZXQvd2V2ZS1wbGVudHktb2Ytb3B0aW9ucy1pbi1zcGluLWRlcGFydG1lbnQtY3VtbWlucy0zNzUyNjYw0gFfaHR0cHM6Ly9zcG9ydHMubmR0di5jb20vY3JpY2tldC93ZXZlLXBsZW50eS1vZi1vcHRpb25zLWluLXNwaW4tZGVwYXJ0bWVudC1jdW1taW5zLTM3NTI2NjAvYW1wLzE?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"""You Forget How Good..."": Pat Cummins Backs Australia Bowling Attack Ahead Of India Test Series","ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='sports.ndtv.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /cricket/weve-plenty-of-options-in-spin-department-cummins-3752660 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002562F45A2C0>, 'Connection to sports.ndtv.com timed out.

The protests were co-ordinated by Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising (PAAU) a direct action group that describes itself as comprising nonviolent feminists committed to dismantling the “abortion industrial complex.” They are calling for anti-abortion supporters to boycott Walgreens CVS and RiteAid in order to prevent money flowing to “Big Abortion.”

“Feb. 4 is just the beginning. There will be more protests and actions to come unless CVS and Walgreens decide to enrich communities rather than support the murder of children to line their pockets” PAAU spokesperson Caroline Smith said in a statement to The Daily Beast. “Their vision to turn pharmacies into abortion businesses which will exploit and kill disproportionately low-income people and people of color for profit will be met with nonviolent resistance at every turn.”

PAAU said they had protests planned at 94 pharmacies with around 400 people signed up to attend via their website and expectations of hundreds more turning out. The group said they expected counter-protesters in bigger cities where actions were being held like San Francisco Boston New York City and Washington D.C.

Abortion rights groups have condemned the group’s actions while some reproductive rights activists have dismissed them as ridiculous.

“Anti-abortion individuals and groups are doing everything in their power to prevent people from being able to access any abortion care nationwide and are promoting an agenda that is not supported by the majority of people in this country” Melissa Fowler chief program officer at the National Abortion Federation told The Daily Beast by email. “Pharmacies that are expanding access to medication abortion are just the latest target of the well-coordinated violent anti-abortion movement.”

“If they wanna embarrass themselves by whining about the ‘abortion-industrial complex’ outside a random pharmacy that’s just funny” the group NYC for Abortion Rights wrote on Instagram. “New Yorkers will be out to watch the clown show.”

Last month the Food and Drug Administration relaxed its rules allowing pharmacies to dispense mifepristone the first of two pills required for a medication abortion. Pharmacy giants CVS and Walgreens immediately announced they would seek certification to sell the medication. (Patients still require a prescription from a health-care provider to access the drug.)

Since the fall of Roe some Republicans and anti-abortion activists have set their sights on eradicating access to abortion medication. At least 18 states have legislation prohibiting the use of telemedicine instead requiring a patient to be in the physical presence of a clinician to receive a prescription.

On Wednesday Attorneys General in 20 states signed a letter to CVS and Walgreens warning that red states might take legal action if the pharmacies send the medication by mail. The letter railed against the Biden administration’s Office of Legal Counsel which recently advised USPS employees could not be held criminally liable for delivering mailed abortion medication regardless of a particular state’s laws.

Over the last few years PAAU activists have made headlines for their bizarre and grisly antics some of which have resulted in arrests and jail time.

In October 2020 Lauren Handy a Catholic anti-abortion zealot and PAAU’s director of activism was among ten people who allegedly blockaded and invaded the Washington Surgi-Clinic a facility providing abortions in Foggy Bottom. Handy pretended to be a patient seeking care according to a federal indictment and the rest of the group used furniture chains ropes and their bodies to block access to the clinic’s doors while live-streaming the protest on Facebook.

The group which included other PAAU activists were federally indicted for violations of the FACE Act which protects access to abortion clinics in May 2022. Handy who has faced similar charges in other states was described by the feds as the ring-leader of the “conspirators.” She has pleaded not guilty but the case is ongoing. Handy faces up to 10 years in prison.

Handy defended her actions in an interview with Catholic news outlet The Pillar in April 2022.

“If abortion is murder then our actions need to be reflective of that” she said “When man’s laws counter God’s law we are under no moral or ethical obligation to acknowledge those laws.”

In November 2021 Handy along with six other PAAU activists including the group’s executive director Terrisa Bukovinac invaded the Alexandria Women’s Health Clinic in Alexandria Virginia. Handy was later sentenced to 30 days in jail for trespassing while other activists including PAAU’s director of communications Kristin Turner served shorter sentences.

In a particularly gruesome incident police removed five fetuses from Handy’s Washington D.C. apartment in March 2022. Handy claimed that she and Bukovinac had been given a total of 115 fetal remains by the driver of a Curtis Bay Medical Waste Services truck outside Washington Surgi-Clinic. The waste company vigorously denied their story.

“At no time did the Curtis Bay employee hand over any of these packages to the PAAU or other third party and any allegations made otherwise are false” the company said.

Handy held a press conference in which she claimed to have had a Catholic priest bless and bury 110 of the smaller fetuses which she said appeared to have been aborted early in pregnancy. PAAU claimed the five fetuses Handy held onto were illegal late-term abortions. However Metropolitan Police Department executive assistant chief Ashan Benedict said the fetuses had been aborted in accordance with D.C. laws.

“There doesn’t seem to be anything criminal in nature about that” Benedict said “except for how they got into this house.”

PAAU have gravitated towards the kinds of extreme tactics used by previous anti-abortion militants such as groups like Operation Rescue founded in 1986 by Randal Terry.

Activists with Operation Rescue blockaded abortion clinics and harassed medical providers. When an abortion provider Dr George Tiller was murdered by an anti-abortion extremist in 2009 Terry defended the killing saying “George Tiller was a mass-murderer.” Terry who ran Operation Rescue until 1991 is now a member of PAAU.

“Ironically calling yourself ‘Progressive Anti-Abortion Uprising’ seems anathema to being progressive if you’re deciding that you’re going to be committed to ensuring that body autonomy is not going to be available” says Lizz Winstead a comedian and founder of the abortion rights group Abortion Access Front.

Winstead who co-created The Daily Show before focusing on reproductive rights says that PAAU’s actions are hypocritical and dangerous. She points out that they’ve shared a platform with Senator Ted Cruz who Winstead says “has actively fought to destroy programs for children and families.”

“Their latest lie is that people are dying from abortion medication. It’s simply not true” Winstead says. “That only does harm to people seeking the care and people providing the care.”

Medication abortion now accounts for around half of all abortions carried out in the United States according to data collected by the Guttmacher Institute. The scientific consensus based on studies conducted over the last twenty years is that abortion medication is safe and effective for ending early pregnancy. The same drugs used for medication abortion including mifepristone are also used to treat miscarriage.

Tensions have been high between anti-abortion activist groups and reproductive rights advocates since the fall of Roe.

Violence against abortion clinic escorts and attacks on clinics are on the rise reporting by The Daily Beast has found. Last week an Illinois man was charged after allegedly setting fire to a Planned Parenthood center in Peoria on Jan. 15. Tyler W. Massengill 32 told investigators his former girlfriend had an abortion at the clinic and that if his actions caused “a little delay” in the clinic’s ability to operate and serve patients then it would have been “all worth it” according to the Peoria Journal Star.

Last month the FBI offered a $25000 reward for information about three arson attacks against anti-abortion groups and centers in Oregon.

Despite the uptick in violence Winstead says anti-abortion activists won’t deter reproductive rights organizers. Today’s protests she says are an attempt to distract from the serious legal charges some activists at PAAU are facing.

“[PAAU] are trying to assert themselves as a smokescreen for the trouble they're about to get in” Winstead says. “We are not afraid of them.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjN2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL2Fib3J0aW9uLXBpbGwtd2FsZ3JlZW5zLXByb3Rlc3QtY3ZzLXJpdGUtYWlkLXBoYXJtYWN5LzEyNzcwMDI0L9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vYWJjN2NoaWNhZ28uY29tL2FtcC9hYm9ydGlvbi1waWxsLXdhbGdyZWVucy1wcm90ZXN0LWN2cy1yaXRlLWFpZC1waGFybWFjeS8xMjc3MDAyNC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Protests today: Demonstrators at Chicago area Walgreens protest against abortion pill Mifepristone,"More than 100 anti-abortion protests are planned nationwide against pharmacy chains Walgreens CVS and Rite Aid.

CHICAGO (WLS) -- More than 100 anti-abortion protests are planned nationwide against pharmacy chains Walgreens CVS and Rite Aid on Saturday.

This is over their plan to sell the ""abortion drug"" Mifepristone. At least seven of those protests are planned to take place in the Chicago area.

Organizers said they want to draw attention to a Canadian woman's death they say happened after she took that drug.

Walgreens issued a statement ahead of the anticipated protests.

""We are not dispensing Mifepristone at this time.

The CDC found that the drug-resistant bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa caused hospitalizations vision loss and even one death among those who used the artificial tears.

More testing is being conducted to determine how the EzriCare Artificial Tears may have become contaminated but experts say it’s a good reminder to continue to practice good eye hygiene.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are urging people to stop using EzriCare Artificial Tears after the eye drops were linked to a drug-resistant bacterial strain resulting in hospitalizations multiple cases of vision loss and one death the agency said Wednesday.

As of January 31 the CDC had identified 55 patients across 12 states with a rare and “extensively drug-resistant” strain of the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa which had never before been reported in the United States. Most patients had used artificial tears—most commonly EzriCare Artificial Tears a preservative-free over-the-counter product.

This strain of bacteria is resistant to a class of antibiotics known as carbapenems which are typically reserved for the most serious infections and are often considered a last resort treatment.

On Thursday the manufacturer of the eye drops voluntarily recalled the product—along with Delsam Pharma’s artificial tears product—due to a possible contamination as the CDC and FDA continue to investigate the cluster of bacterial infections.

“As of today we are not aware of any testing that definitively links the Pseudomonas aeruginosa outbreak to EzriCare Artificial Tears” the company wrote in a statement on Wednesday. “Nonetheless we immediately took action to stop any further distribution or sale of EzriCare Artificial Tears.”

Here’s what eye drop users should know about their risk of infection and the symptoms people who have recently used the eye drops should be aware of.

What Is Pseudomonas aeruginosa?

This specific strain of bacteria—carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa with Verona integron-mediated metallo-β-lactamase and Guiana-extended spectrum-β-lactamase (VIM-GES-CRPA)—had never previously been reported in the U.S. but the bacterium itself is not entirely unknown.

“This pathogen that we’re talking about Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a bacteria that is not uncommonly involved in serious corneal infections” Brooke Harkness OD assistant professor of ophthalmology at the Oregon Health and Science University Casey Eye Institute told Health. “But it’s usually found just in the environment so in water and soil.”

It can become a serious issue when it gets into the body. The bacteria has been known to cause infections of the lungs blood or in other parts of the body after surgery. For the eyes specifically people who wear contact lenses—especially people who sleep in them or rinse them with tap water—are at risk of bacterial infections such as these Dr. Harkness added.

And these bacterial infections are almost always quite serious said James D. Reynolds MD professor and chair of the Ross Eye Institute and department of ophthalmology at the University of Buffalo Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences.

“They tend to be very virulent organisms and therefore [are] very effective at attacking human tissue” Dr. Reynolds told Health. “[People] always end up with a significant scar even if you’re able to cure the disease. And that scar of course will cause significant reduced vision and may require corneal transplantation. So Pseudomonas is a bad bug.”

Once it’s in the eye Dr. Reynolds explained the Pseudomonas releases a specific type of enzyme that allows it to break down chemical bonds in the eye and penetrate the conjunctiva and then the cornea resulting in a loss of vision in some capacity.

Treating this type of bacterial infection can be extremely difficult. In addition to being resistant to the antibiotic carbapenem it’s resistant to multiple other antibiotics as well.

What Are the Symptoms of an Eye Infection?

The CDC has linked this outbreak to multiple types of infections including eye infections respiratory infections urinary tract infections and sepsis.

The agency is urging people who have used EzriCare Artificial Tears to be aware of any signs or symptoms of an eye infection and to seek medical care immediately so they can be tested for the bacterial infection.

The symptoms most commonly associated with eye infections include:

Yellow green or clear discharge from the eye

Eye pain or discomfort

Redness of the eye or eyelid

Feeling like something is in the eye

Increased sensitivity to light

Blurry vision

However the CDC is not recommending that patients who have used this product but aren’t experiencing any symptoms of eye infection get tested.

Should You Be Concerned About Using Preservative-Free Eye Drops?

CDC lab testing on opened bottles of EzriCare Artificial Tears identified the presence of the bacteria that matched the strain found in infected people. The bottles were collected from patients with and without eye infections and could mean the eye drop bottles were infected during use or during the manufacturing stage.

Currently the CDC is testing unopened bottles of the eye drops to help narrow down at what point the bacteria could have ended up contaminating the products.

Regardless of how the Pseudomonas aeruginosa got into the artificial tears solution the fact that the EzriCare product is reportedly preservative-free likely played a role in helping it grow and spread experts said.

When these types of eye solutions don’t have preservatives it usually means that they have a shorter shelf life and it will take less time for them to start to grow bacteria as compared to eye solutions with preservatives said Michael Wildes MD clinical director for the UCHealth Sue Anschutz-Rodgers Eye Center and ophthalmologist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus.

People who may be more susceptible to infections—such as those who wear contact lenses those who are immunocompromised or those who have some sort of eye disease or injury—can start to see infections from their eye drops if the lack of preservatives is allowing bacteria to grow he added.

Preservative-free eye drops are not inherently bad—in fact they can be useful for people who have allergies in particular Dr. Reynolds explained. But they need to have additional protection in the packaging.

“It needs to somehow otherwise be protected against contamination” Dr. Harkness said. “That typically would be either by packaging in very small doses—single-use dose vials—or in a special bottle that has a one way valve and a filter to protect the bottle from being contaminated.”

The CDC pointed out that the EzriCare products were packaged in multi-dose bottles.

How to Practice Proper Eye Hygiene

Though Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections can be quite serious experts say that the best thing to do to prevent them along with other eye infections is to stay committed to using best practices when dealing with eye drops or contacts.

""If people find bottles that they have of this particular brand then dispose of them immediately” Dr. Harkness said. “[But] we never have a way of knowing when this will occur [so] practicing good hygiene with contact lenses is extremely important.”

That means washing hands before touching contacts avoiding rinsing contact lenses cases or eyes with tap water and making sure to get rid of eye drops and other eye products after they expire or after 90 days she said.

People should also consider seeking out medical care earlier rather than later if they suspect they might have an infection Dr. Reynolds explained. Symptoms such as redness in the eye eye discomfort or pain and discharge from the eye may all seem like pink eye when it’s really another more dangerous type of Pseudomonas bacterial infection he said.

Besides being a reminder to commit to those hygiene practices the CDC’s investigation shouldn’t be a reason to ditch other brands eye drops or artificial lenses. Although infected patients reported using over 10 different brands of artificial tears the CDC has not named or voiced any concerns about brands other than EzriCare.

“In general this is a fairly uncommon thing” Dr. Wildes said. “We don’t have any concerns about using other brands of artificial tears whether they’re preservative free or not.”

But it’s also a good idea for people to check in with their doctors to make sure that they’re using the best types of artificial tears or eye drops that they can be whether that be with or without preservatives.

“People definitely should not overreact to this if they are artificial tear users” Dr. Reynolds said. “But every patient—with every eye drop—should practice sterile technique.”

Gov. Sarah Sanders announced the state grant at the Lonoke Business Academy Friday (Feb. 3).

Students will spend 2.5 hours a day in the classes and will earn air-conditioning computer diagnostics hydraulics and electrical certifications. Greenway’s investment will pay for equipment tools and the instructor. Greenway designed the curriculum.

Jared Field Greenway training manager said in an interview that the certification process for adult trainees normally lasts about two years. Lonoke students will undergo most of that training during their junior and senior years.

Once they graduate they’ll need another three months of training to be a John Deere-certified technician. Then they’ll be ready for jobs that start at $40000 plus monthly performance bonuses. After about a year they can be earning $60000 to $80000 Field said.

Superintendent Jeff Senn said Lonoke is the first school in Arkansas to be affiliated with John Deere and one of only two in the country.

“I don’t know of many schools in the nation in Arkansas especially that can say when you walk out on graduation day the very next day you’ll start at a $40000 job that we taught you to do” he said.

Senn said the district wanted to work with a local employer and wanted to provide opportunities and direction for its students. He said only about 30%-35% of Lonoke graduates attend college and that schools have been too focused on academia and not enough on students entering the workforce.

Field said the company created the program to benefit the community and to bolster its own workforce. Family-owned Greenway operates 27 dealerships in Arkansas four within 30 miles of Lonoke and five in southeastern Missouri.

“Any given moment we’re looking for at least 30 service technicians and so there’s always space within our shops” he said. “For kids that are not interested in going to post-secondary education this is an opportunity to grab them while they’re in high school get them up to speed educated to where they can roll out and immediately be as effective as one of our service technicians who’s been with us for several years.”

The $1.2 million state grant will pay for tools and equipment requested by Greenway. Senn credited Ken Calhoun board chair of the Office of Skills Development with helping spearhead the grant.

In announcing the grant Sanders said the program is unlike any other in the country and that it can be replicated elsewhere.

“I spent about two years on the campaign traveling all over the state” she said. “Every single corner that I went to every region every business leader I met with everybody had the same problem: They could not find skilled qualified workers fast enough and so what is happening here today is changing the game changing the dynamic of what really building a skilled qualified workforce looks like.”

The two-year program will start this fall and be limited to 24 students who will undergo an application and interview process before being accepted. Students must be on course to graduate on time in order to be accepted.

Field said the company wanted to limit the classes to 24 students half in the morning and half in the afternoon so they can receive more hands-on instruction. He said students will be trained on up-to-date technology.

“Autonomy is coming real soon in John Deere tractors” he said. “Those tractors are out there. They’re floating around right now. So we’ll bring some of that latest and greatest. As it filters into our area we’ll bring autonomy into these shops so that they can see autonomous tractors.”

Field said students who discover they don’t want to be service technicians will gain skills they can use elsewhere in the company such as in the parts department. Classes their senior year will cover John Deere communications and computer processes.

They also can find employment working for other companies in the agriculture or diesel mechanic fields if they decide not to work for Greenway.

The program will be housed in the 30000-square-foot Lonoke Business Academy. It was built after the district passed a 2.5-mill increase in March 2020 – an effort led by then-private citizen and now-Lonoke School Board member Elizabeth Anderson and her husband Jamie. The program teaches classes in industrial technology diesel mechanics agriculture aquaculture horticulture hydroponics welding animal science and rural health care.

Through the diesel mechanics program students can earn concurrent credit hours with Arkansas State University – Beebe. Senn said 50-60 students are involved in those classes now.

The Greenway program does not offer concurrent credit. It also includes an agriculture focus that includes training on harvest systems including combines hay bailers and cotton pickers.

Field said Greenway decided to work with Lonoke after the school district approached the company. The district already had built the facility and had done the heavy lifting he said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53YW9ubGluZS5jb20vbmV3cy8yMDIzL2ZlYi8wNC8xMm0tZ3JhbnQtd2lsbC1mdW5kLXRlY2huaWNhbC10cmFpbmluZy1wcm9ncmFtLWF0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$1.2M grant will fund technical training program at Lonoke schools,"Lonoke Public Schools will receive a $1.2 million grant for its technical training program Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced Friday.

The grant from the Arkansas Office of Skills Development will go toward funding tools and equipment at the Lonoke Business Academy a skills-based school that is a part of the Lonoke School District.

Greenway a group of John Deere tractor dealerships helped provide equipment for the school. Speaking at the academy Sanders praised the school as a model for how schools can provide education that does not necessarily steer students toward college.

""This program will train students not just here in Lonoke but all across the region"" Sanders said. ""And it will have a huge impact on the success of our state and again set the standard for how we can do this right.""

The academy has industrial and diesel technology programs and a medical program that prepares students for careers in healthcare. The academy opened in 2021 after voters in Lonoke approved an increase in the millage which was used to fund the 30000-square-foot school building that includes classrooms laboratories an auditorium and meeting spaces according to the academy's website. The academy has a partnership with Arkansas State University-Beebe.

The school's campus also includes a 12000-square-foot medical clinic supported in partnership with Baptist Health and the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Family Medicine Residency Program.

Elizabeth Burns Anderson a member of the Lonoke School Board said the grant was the first state-level investment for the academy.

""This facility is creating sustainability for agricultural careers to continue to thrive right here at the front porch of Arkansas' Delta"" Anderson said.

Sanders said education is her priority for her new administration and said she will introduce a bill to overhaul the state's education system. The bill will likely include a provision to encourage public schools to adopt more technical career programs Sanders said.

The governor has not released specifics of her education plan but has indicated it will include an emphasis on literacy vouchers higher teacher pay career readiness expanded high-speed internet and more robust security.

""What is happening here today is changing the game changing the dynamic of what really building a skilled qualified workforce looks like"" Sanders said. ""That is why I am so excited [about] what is happening right here in this community. It is something I think we can replicate all across the state of Arkansas.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vamFtYmFuZHMuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy8wMi8wNS9iaWxseS1zdHJpbmdzLWNvbmNsdWRlcy1jb2xvcmFkby1zdGludC13aXRoLWhpZ2gtb2N0YW5lLWV2ZW5pbmctYXQtMXN0YmFuay1jZW50ZXIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Billy Strings Concludes Colorado Stint with High Octane Evening at 1STBANK Center,"Billy Strings Concludes Colorado Stint with High Octane Evening at 1STBANK Center

Last night Billy Strings closed out his winter 2023 tour kick-off with his third and final performance at the 1STBANK Center in Broomfield Colo. The evening served as the culmination of Strings’ superb interpretations innovation and celebration of bluegrass which proliferated over each night.

Strings opened the final show at the sold-out 6500-capacity arena with his fan favorite “Dust in a Baggie” instantly uniting the droves of fans who had gathered to see him. He quickly locked into the flow with his bandmates and walked through complex bluegrass compositions like “Heartbeat of America” Dan Fogelberg’s “Along the Road and Roy Acuff’s “The Streamlined Cannonball” with ease. Strings then dipped into his own discography for a pairing of “The Fire on My Tounge” with “Know It All” before moving into two more covers: a stomping “John Deere Tractor” by Larry Sparks and “The Preacher and the Bear” by Arthur Francis Collins. Another fan favorite penned by Strings came next the title track of his 2021 LP Wargasm. The ensemble then moved into an aberrant bluegrass interpretation of The Moody Blues’ love anthem “Nights in White Satin.” After a few more originals like “This Old World” and “Bronzeback” Strings closed the frame with a penultimate cover of John Hartford’s “All Fall Down” and a closing “These Old Blues.”

After a short set break Strings and company–Billy Failing (banjo) Royal Masat (bass) Jarrod Walker (mandolin) and Alex Hargreaves (fiddle)–wasted no time flowing into a cover of The Oak Ridge Boys’ “Dig a Little Deeper in the Well.” Highlights from the passion-fueled rock-and-roll segment included “Slow Train” Eddie Noack’s “Psycho” which morphed into J.J. Cale’s “Ride Me High” “The Train That Carried My Girl From Town” by Doc Watson into the traditional “Black Mountain Rag” New Grass Revival’s tender “Whisper My Name” Danny Barnes euphonious “Pretty Daughter” and a set closing extended rendition of “Turmoil & Tinfoil” that saw back and forth between the ensemble not to mention an array of expressions and smiles that could only be made by those fully enveloped by the creation of music.

Strings then returned to the stage and gave thanks for his friends and bandmates and told fans he would be heading to Nashville Tenn. to spend some time resting and recording–quelling the rumors of a possible sit-in with Phil Lesh & Friends at the Mission Ballroom the following evening–before singing Jimmy Martin’s homage to The Volunteer State “Tennessee.” After the blistering tune during which Strings sang delightfully “There lives a sweetheart who said she’d marry me/ As soon as I get back to that state of Tennessee” the ensemble stepped to the front of the stage looked out to the adoring fans thanked them one more time and bowed.

Meanwhile Delta is finally going to grow in Austin. I broke the news they planned a focus city in my home town nearly five years ago. Growth here delayed by the pandemic is finally beginning recognizing that they were falling behind at the number one growth airport in the country.

Fully Utilizing A Gate At Dallas Love Field

This past summer after a seven year ordeal Delta leveraged the Department of Transportation to force Dallas Love Field to give them a gate and get the City of Dallas to pay for it. Starting June 5 Delta is ramping up use of gate 11.

2x daily service to New York LaGuardia

2x daily service to Los Angeles

5x daily service to Atlanta

By law there are only 20 gates at Dallas Love Field. There used to be 32 but 12 were ordered eliminated as part of a deal to lifted Wright Amendment restrictions on where flights could go from the airport while still limiting competition for American Airlines flights out of Dallas – Fort Worth and giving Southwest Airlines a stranglehold on the smaller airport.

Southwest Airlines used to be the one fighting to be allowed to fly but in this process turned into the one fighting to enforce a government-granted monopoly. Here’s how Southwest wound up with 18 of the airport’s 20 gates.

They had leases for 16

United Airlines leased two. Delta was using one of those gates. But United got a better deal leasing them to Southwest giving Southwest control of 18 gates

American Airlines had two gates but gave them up as a condition of government-approval for their US Airways merger. The gates went to Virgin America and are now controlled by Alaska Airlines which acquired Virgin.

All of this left Southwest with 18 gates Alaska with 2 and Delta without a gate in the game of musical airport chairs.

However the Department of Transportation said that the City of Dallas had to continue to accommodate Delta at Love Field even though it had no gates to do so couldn’t legally build more and Southwest had a valid lease for the gate Delta was using.

The FAA threated to issue a determination that the City of Dallas was in noncompliance with its Federal grant obligations in the operation of Dallas Love Field making them ineligible for FAA grant funds.

Everyone wound up in Court. Just for kicks American Airlines got involved to say they wanted gates at Love Field too! (They didn’t really they were basically trolling.) In the meantime Delta squatted on a Love Field gate half the time.

Here’s how they settled:

Alaska Airlines doesn’t actually want to use two gates at Love Field

So Delta will use one of them

And the City of Dallas will kick in $200000 a year to lease the gate for Delta through 2028

Delta used to at least pretend to be against government subsidies for the airline industry now they are vocally in favor.

None of this would have been an issue if the federal government hadn’t limited the number of gates at Love Field helping to cartelize the airport and if the city hadn’t destroyed gates there would have been a greater chance of redress through Congress.

Growth In Austin Finally Begins

Delta’s 2018 plan for a focus city was delayed. All they really did was open a gorgeous new Sky Club with an outdoor deck while joint venture partner KLM began service to Amsterdam and vassal Virgin Atlantic launched service to London.

They dropped plans for all of their focus cities except Austin and Raleigh in 2021 but still didn’t actually do anything to grow in Austin.

Currently Southwest Airlines is the dominant carrier in Austin following by American. According to data from Cirium Diio Mi February schedules break down as follows:

Flights Seats Seat Miles Southwest 38% 41% 33% American 29% 25% 21% United 11% 11% 10% Delta 10% 10% 11%

Delta’s flying in Austin consists of:



Atlanta: 7 peak daily departures. This will grow to 10 starting July 10.



7 peak daily departures. This will grow to 10 starting July 10. Boston: 2 peak daily departures. This will grow to 3 starting July 10.



2 peak daily departures. This will grow to 3 starting July 10. Detroit: 3 peak daily departures. This will remain the same.



3 peak daily departures. This will remain the same. New York JFK: 3 daily departures. This will grow to 4 starting June 5.



3 daily departures. This will grow to 4 starting June 5. Los Angeles: 3 peak daily departures. This will grow to 4 starting July 10.



3 peak daily departures. This will grow to 4 starting July 10. Minneapolis: 3 peak daily departures. This will grow to 4 starting July 10.



3 peak daily departures. This will grow to 4 starting July 10. Seattle: 2 peak daily departures. This will grow to 3 starting July 10.



2 peak daily departures. This will grow to 3 starting July 10. Salt Lake City: 3 peak daily departures. This will grow to 4 starting June 5.



3 peak daily departures. This will grow to 4 starting June 5. Raleigh: 1 Delta connection flight. Delta will offer 2 frequencies starting July 10.



Delta Sky Club Austin

This represents 10 additional daily flights which are supportably by their current gates. This represents roughly a 37% increase in daily departures for the airline. That won’t move their overall market share in the city except to pull ahead of United to a clearer number three. It also means flying only to Delta’s own hubs still plus their other focus city of Raleigh which they’ve been backing away from.

However it means offering substantially more service on their own terms great for Delta flying in the city and great for convenient schedules and connectivity.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlbHRhLW5ldy15b3JrLXNvdXRoLWFtZXJpY2Etcm91dGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Delta unveils 2 long-haul routes from NYC to South America,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vdGhlcG9pbnRzZ3V5LmNvbS9uZXdzL2RlbHRhLW5ldy15b3JrLXNvdXRoLWFtZXJpY2Etcm91dGVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025626A93400>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Delta adds new Buenos Aires route as of October 2023

As noted by @IshrionA and per a schedule filing Delta will launch a daily nonstop flight between New York (JFK) and Buenos Aires (EZE). The route is expected to launch on October 28 2023 and is now on sale. It will operate with the following schedule:

DL115 New York to Buenos Aires departing 8:50PM arriving 8:00AM (+1 day)

DL114 Buenos Aires to New York departing 8:15PM arriving 5:35AM (+1 day)

Delta will use a Boeing 767-400ER for the route featuring 238 seats. This includes 34 business class seats 20 premium economy seats 28 extra legroom economy seats and 156 economy seats. The 5282-mile flight is blocked at 10hr10min southbound and 10hr20min northbound.

This is technically a service resumption as Delta last operated this route roughly 14 years ago in 2009.

Delta will fly from New York to Buenos Aires

How this Buenos Aires flight fits into Delta’s network

It’s interesting to see Delta’s approach in Latin America nowadays. Keep in mind that in September 2019 Delta announced plans to acquire a 20% stake in LATAM. This caught the industry by surprise since previously American and LATAM partnered and LATAM was part of oneworld.

This was clearly an attempt on Delta’s part to be more competitive in Latin America. Admittedly Delta’s timing here was unfortunate since this was right before the pandemic. Not only did this horribly impact international demand but the value of its LATAM investment also plunged.

So how does this new route flight fit into Delta’s overall strategy and the competitive landscape?

Delta otherwise exclusively flies to Buenos Aires out of Atlanta so this will only be the carrier’s second route to Buenos Aires

LATAM has a fairly small presence in Argentina and its LATAM Argentina subsidiary ceased operations in 2022; Delta does however have a partnership with Aerolineas Argentinas which is also in SkyTeam

Delta’s only other destination in “deep” South America out of New York is Sao Paulo which is a major LATAM hub

Delta will be competing head-to-head against American which has been serving this route for a very long time despite having a smaller New York presence than Delta; Aerolineas Argentinas also serves the route but isn’t a particularly competitive airline

It’s interesting to me how little expansion we’ve seen to Latin America as a result of the LATAM investment. As far as the three biggest LATAM hubs goes Delta only flies to Lima out of Atlanta to Santiago out of Atlanta and to Sao Paulo out of Atlanta and New York. I believe all those routes were also operated before the investment.

Now some might say that part of the intent is that LATAM increasingly flies to Delta’s gateways though we haven’t seen much of that either. LATAM doesn’t fly to Atlanta or Detroit and the carrier has maintained most of its service to Miami despite Delta’s limited presence there (admittedly Miami is the biggest O&D market for Latin America).

The only other new route we’re seeing is a Sao Paulo to Los Angeles route on LATAM launching in several months.

I get why Delta wanted to grow in South America but is this partnership really delivering many results?

Is this Delta and LATAM partnership delivering?

Bottom line

As of late October 2023 Delta will be launching a new daily nonstop flight between New York and Buenos Aires with a Boeing 767. This will be the carrier’s second route from New York to “deep” South America with the other one being to Sao Paulo.

It’s cool to see more competition in the market though I can’t help but find it interesting how Delta hasn’t significantly increased its presence in Latin America since acquiring a stake in LATAM. Maybe we’ll see more of that now that international travel is recovering.

Scams to be aware of in 2023

Bruemmer breaks down scams into two big categories: phishing and social engineering. Phishing mostly occurs online and involves fraudulent communication purporting to be from reputable sources such as a bank or employer. The scammer attempts to steal your personal data such as credit card information or login credentials for financial accounts. Social engineering on the other hand usually happens over the phone and sometimes in person. Bad actors use psychological manipulation and deception to gain access to your money or confidential information. Here are five types of phishing and social engineering scams Bruemmer thinks will be prevalent this year. 1. Charitable donations scam To get their hands on your money scammers will stoop to any low including exploiting your empathy. Charity scams range from simplistic one-man operations to complex schemes run by registered nonprofits. In either case the money you're rushed to donate doesn't help any cause. Instead it goes straight to the fraudster. This kind of scam can take the form of phishing where a website or email letter looks like it's from a legitimate organization. More often however a scammer will use social engineering and approach you over the phone or in person to play on your emotions. Don't allow people to prey on your generosity. Research any organization before donating and look for the Employer Identification Number (EIN) on the nonprofit's website to ensure the money is going to the right place.

Romance scams Another social engineering scam that can leave you not only in financial ruin but also heartbroken is a romance scam. These scams aren't always as elaborate as Netflix's ""The Tinder Swindler"" and most of them happen online. The criminal meets you on a dating or social media app sweeps you off your feet and tries to get into a relationship with you quickly. They're experts at appearing caring sincere and downright perfect. One common sign of a romance scammer is that they probably live far away and make plans to meet you in person — but never will. Instead they'll ask you for money to pay for unexpected medical bills or to get them out of trouble. Usually they'll instruct you to wire money or put it on a gift card. They might keep asking you for money repeatedly until you stop sending it at which point the love of your online life will disappear. Victims of romance scams often find themselves in debt legal trouble and with serious trust issues. To avoid falling for a dangerous fake go slowly in any kind of online romance and don't feel bad about thoroughly researching the person — especially if they seem perfect. ""If it is too good to be true… it's probably a scam"" Bruemmer says. 3. Fitness and weight loss scams It's human nature to want spectacular results with minimal effort especially when it comes to fitness goals. But scammers are taking advantage of people's desire to shed a few pounds to try and make their bank accounts lighter as well. On the phishing side you might come across a fake website posing as a legitimate site that promotes some kind of fitness program. The goal is usually to get you to provide your personal or financial information. Alternatively someone might try to persuade you to sign up for a low-priced gym membership or a different fitness product promising ""you can get 100 pounds off in three weeks and look like new because of the program… for which you have to provide your personal details and credit card"" Bruemmer says. The bottom line here is if something seems too cheap or too good to be true exercise caution and run far away from it. 4. Car warranty scams You know a scam is prevalent when it becomes a meme. You have probably seen pictures or videos online making fun of phone calls ""trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty."" After all this is one of the most common robocalls Americans get. ""I have a software app on my phone that blocks calls"" Bruemmer shares. ""I got seven calls for extended car warranty [last week] because they try to leave a voicemail."" If you're also ignoring these calls then keep up the good work. Otherwise you'll most likely be prompted to provide personal or financial information. Or the fraudster might try to sell you a fake extended auto warranty defrauding you out of thousands of dollars. For that reason when you pick up the phone and hear a pre-recorded message about your car warranty simply hang up. If you think that might be your car dealership calling you you can call them back using their official number to double-check. 5. Gift card scams According to a last year's survey from AARP 26% of U.S. consumers received a gift card with no funds on it. What gives? There are a couple of ways scammers can drain a gift card's balance before you use it. They might for instance take cards off the store rack tamper with the protective strips and steal the bar codes. The fraudster buys similar security tape and replaces the strips to make the card look untouched. Then they enter the card's code into a program that tracks the retailer's website and informs the scammer when someone buys the card so they can spend the money on it or cash it. As a result by the time the card makes it to its recipient it's a worthless piece of plastic. Other fraudsters advertise gift card exchange websites or sites that offer to check your gift card balance. You're prompted to input your gift card information which the scammer then uses to drain the card's balance. When buying a gift card take a close look at it to ensure it hasn't been tampered with — and only buy from reputable resellers. Don't miss: Did you receive a gift card you don't need? Here's how to sell it for cash

How to protect yourself from scams

Scammers can be inventive and extremely persuasive. Luckily you can follow a few guidelines to avoid getting caught in their schemes. Here's what Bruemmer recommends: Don't use a debit card A debit card is linked directly to your checking account and in some cases your savings and other accounts. Debit cards don't offer the same consumer protections credit cards do. Once someone steals your money it might be difficult to get it back. For that reason it's best to use credit cards for most transactions. The Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA) protects you against credit card fraud and limits your maximum liability to $50 though many card issuers expand that law by offering $0 fraud liability on unauthorized charges. Besides you can also earn rewards with a credit card. For example the Chase Freedom Unlimited® CNBC Select's top pick for the best cash-back credit card earns 6.5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Travel 4.5% cash back on drugstore purchases and dining at restaurants (including takeout and eligible delivery service) and 3% on all other purchases (on up to $20000 spent in the first year). After your first year or $20000 spent enjoy 5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Travel 3% cash back on drugstore purchases and dining at restaurants including takeout and eligible delivery service and unlimited 1.5% cash back on all other purchases. Other cards can earn you rewards for travel. CNBC Select picked the American Express® Gold Card as the best travel card since it offers generous returns on common spending categories including restaurants U.S. supermarkets and airfare.

Be careful about letting your credit card out of your sight When you give someone your card it's all too easy for them to use a skimming device which reads the magnetic strip of your card and stores the card's information. While it's unrealistic to expect the waitstaff at your favorite restaurant to let you hop in the back and swipe your own card try to minimize the times someone swipes it out of your sight. ""If they're going to run it through a machine it should be in front of your eyes"" Bruemmer says. Only click links you trust Since fraudsters are getting very creative in masking their phishing attempts treat every link you get with suspicion. ""My rule of thumb is if somebody is going to send me something that they want me to click on they need to call me and say 'Hey Mike this is what I'm sending you. This is the link it's legit"" Bruemmers says. To spot phishing check where the message is coming from — if it's claiming to be from a reputable company but sent from a generic Gmail email address or an address that has subtle misspellings (like ""amaz0n"" instead of ""amazon"") it's probably a scam. Additionally watch out for bad grammar or emails threatening you or urging you to take action. For example a scammer might say your bank account is about to be blocked and provide a link you need to click to avoid it. Always err on the side of caution when it comes to links and attachments. If you have doubts about whether or not an email or text is a phishing attempt get in touch with the actual company that's supposedly sent it using their official communication channels. Monitor your credit If you've become a victim of fraud you might discover it on your credit report as new accounts you haven't opened or addresses you don't recognize. While nobody likes to see they've been swindled the earlier you detect the crime the sooner you can do something about it. To keep an eye on your credit you can get a free credit report once a year from each bureau at AnnualCreditReport.com (due to the pandemic you can get free reports weekly through December 2023) or sign up for a credit monitoring service. While free credit monitoring services such as Experian Dark Web Scan + Credit Monitoring can cover the basics you receive more comprehensive coverage if you put down some money. For example IdentityForce® UltraSecure and UltraSecure+Credit offers three-bureau credit monitoring and track your information on various sites and services including the dark web court records and social media.

Don't answer phone calls from unrecognized numbers With scammers sometimes all it takes is you picking up the phone and saying a few words for fraud to happen. Bruemmer says that he's set up his phone so that all calls from numbers outside of his contact list go straight to voicemail. ""Even [when you're] saying hello and your name someone can grab a voiceprint and use that as a second factor of authentication with a financial institution or to authorize a transaction"" he explains.

Bottom line

With scams getting elaborate and preying on every facet of human nature it may feel as though your financial well-being is at constant risk. Luckily you can protect yourself from most scams by just staying vigilant and cautious. If someone you don't know is urging you to make a financial decision in a rush question their motives. If something seems too good to be true listen to your gut. Remember: damage from identity fraud and financial scams is much easier to prevent than fix.

Mimas is Saturn's smallest and inner-most moon and according to researchers that published a recent paper in the Geophysical Research Letters journal NASA's Cassini Mission to Saturn identified an oscillation in Mimas' rotation which is typically an indicator for that body being geologically active body and able to support an internal ocean. Notably researchers first believed that Mimas wouldn't be a likely candidate for an internal ocean as its icy surface is peppered with craters and featured one giant crater that makes the moon resemble the iconic Death Star from Star Wars.

This large crater on Mimas was the focal point of the study and is called the Herschel impact basin. Scientists modeled the formation of the Hershel impact basin using simulation software called iSALE-2D. The results indicated that Mimas' crust had to be 34 miles thick when the Hershel impact occurred. Notably recent observations of Mimas indicate that the crust is approximately 19 miles thick leading researchers to believe that Mimas has been warming and expanding since the Hershel impact.

The researchers behind the study explained that if Mimas has an ocean today the ice shell has been thinning since the Herschel impact basin formed and could also explain the lack of overall fractures across the moon. Furthermore the researchers said that if Mimas is proven to be an emerging ocean world it will give astronomers more information about the evolution formation and habitability of all mid-sized moons orbiting Saturn.

The scientists note that their study does have limitations such as the unknown of Mimas' thermal-orbital evolution. This gap in information means it's difficult for the researchers to develop a clear understanding of the moon's orbital and geological characteristics.

In other space news a mysterious flying spiral was caught on video hovering above Hawaii. The video was released by the observatory located at the highest peak in Hawaii and showcased a spiral emerging and eventually disappearing.

Among all rising costs sky-high grocery bills have been especially painful. Although the consumer price index an inflation gauge that measures the cost of a broad basket of goods and services started to ease as of the latest reading food prices were up yet again the U.S. Department of Labor reported. Over the past year food prices overall have risen more than 10%. Egg prices alone soared 60% butter is up more than 31% and lettuce jumped 25% according to Labor Department data through December. As a result consumers are looking for any — and all — ways to save. For some that means shopping at their local dollar store.

Dollar stores are pulling in more grocery shoppers

'It's about making your dollar go a little further'

These days shoppers are considering alternatives especially if it means better prices said Julie Ramhold consumer analyst with DealNews. ""It's about making your dollar go a little further."" However the value is not always there she added. Despite the name ""you will be hard-pressed to find items that are just a dollar."" It's important to check the unit price and compare with the offerings at other stores including Walmart and Trader Joe's Ramhold said.

In addition the grocery assortment will still be smaller than what you would find at a supermarket or a warehouse club. For example the selection of fruits and vegetables may be limited to more shelf-stable offerings like bagged salad mixes and bananas Ramhold said. Further with less turnover you are more likely to find items near the expiration date. ""It's important to check 'best by' dates"" she cautioned.

To that end Ramhold advises shoppers to focus on staples such as rice pasta and dried beans which can also be tailored to fit different cuisines and don't cost very much. (""The Dollar Store Cookbook"" available on Amazon has recipes that are mostly limited to such pantry-stable ingredients including a creamed tuna on toast made with canned tuna and cream of celery soup.)

Students happily tried out ballet dance moves at the Nathan Hale Arts Magnet School in preparation for seeing The Nutcracker as part of The Garde Arts Center’s Schooltime Performance Series this past winter. It’s just one of the ways the New London-based school and others in the region use performances at the Garde to complement the school curriculum.

“The benefits of participation for our students are numerous” says Angela Maurice a second-grade teacher at Nathan Hale who has been bringing classes to the performances at the Garde for about seven years. “Students are exposed to classical music and dance. They learn how to participate appropriately as an audience and some students even become inspired to further pursue an interest in ballet.”

For more than 30 years the Garde’s Schooltime Performance Series has hosted students in Grades K-12 for curriculum-based professional theater and arts performances during the school year.

It all started when Executive Director Steve Sigel was contacted by several children’s touring companies asking if they would rent out the theater to bring schools in for shows. After witnessing how successful the performances were Sigel decided to hire them as part of his effort to introduce students from the region and across the state to the independent historical theater.

“It’s really an introduction to New London for a lot of young people and it’s been an important tool to remind the community of just how diverse we are” Sigel says. “One of my favorite memories is watching this kid get out of a bus look up at the theater and say to his teacher ‘is this what the city looks like?’ It was as if he was in Times Square and it touched me because he lives here in Connecticut but in a rural community and bringing him down to a city even a small one meant a lot.”

With support from Dominion Energy the Schooltime Performance Series presents 10 to 12 shows each school year put on by some of the nation’s finest education-based touring theater and dance companies.

Over the years the performances have included mini operas from Salt Marsh Opera dances from an Afro-Brazilian contemporary dance company and many more.

“We try to mix it up and try new things” says Sigel.

The performances are often tied into what students are learning in English history social studies and other classes. Each show comes with learning guides that schools can use before or after attending.

“They’re musical versions of books and we pick them to be a mix of pre-K to middle school with a smattering of high school” Sigel says adding that the Garde receives feedback and advice from area teachers and the New London Education Foundation on what they offer.

This year’s performance of Eastern Connecticut Ballet’s The Nutcracker was particularly special for the students at Nathan Hale Magnet School as it was the first field trip they’d taken since COVID restrictions were lifted and the students saw one of their own classmates performing on stage as one of the characters.

“The performance fits into our curriculum in many ways” Maurice says. The students studied different kinds of dance with our dance teacher including ballet and our music teacher taught students about the music in The Nutcracker. We also make connections through text and vocabulary.”

Members of the ballet company also visited with the students before the performance telling them about the story of The Nutcracker and the dances they would see.

For many students the performances are their first introduction to theater. That exposure according to many studies can encourage collaborative and divergent thinking and even help to teach empathy. And students that have some form of theater education tend to have increased vocabulary skills and perform better on standardized tests.

“These performances bring together communities that are often isolated and don’t have the opportunity to be a part of a bigger community” says Sigel. “When the students leave we announce the school and the kids are cheering for their school and other students are hearing about that school. The most important thing isn’t what’s happening on the stage but what happens in the theater.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vcmljaG1vbmQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWVldC10aGUtMTItd29tZW4td2hvLWRyaXZlLXJpY2htb25kL2FydGljbGVfYTViNTVkZjgtYTNmYy0xMWVkLTljYTMtNGJmNmMzYzIzMDIyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Meet the 12 'Women Who Drive Richmond',"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMif2h0dHBzOi8vcmljaG1vbmQuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvYnVzaW5lc3MvbWVldC10aGUtMTItd29tZW4td2hvLWRyaXZlLXJpY2htb25kL2FydGljbGVfYTViNTVkZjgtYTNmYy0xMWVkLTljYTMtNGJmNmMzYzIzMDIyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025627A686A0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

When Judith Achumba-Wöllenstein and her husband Timothy moved from Germany to London back in 2016 they arrived with the expensive mattress they had just purchased. The problem was the size of the bed was so unusual that they couldn’t find a frame for it. So Judith the founder of Atelier Akuko did what most people do when they’re stuck in a design jam: She went to IKEA. For years the couple combined a series of Ivar cabinets to create a platform for the mattress. (The bonus: It offered tons of extra storage.)

But when Timothy and Judith purchased a two-bedroom apartment in 2018 the ceilings turned out to be too low for the makeshift piece. So they decided to disperse the plain pine cupboards throughout their home. “There was at least one in every room including the hallway and soon I got really tired of looking at them” says Judith. After gifting two of them and selling two five remained.

One Ivar became a stand-alone living room unit with tubular pipes as legs and a wood ball–clad facade that sort of resembles an actor’s motion-capture suit. “I like when furniture looks like it has a quirky personality almost anthropomorphic” shares Judith. The other four cabinets lived in the office (which later became a nursery) and she covered them in painted foam shapes for a bas-relief effect that is reminiscent of the work of French artists Constantin Brâncusi and Garance Vallée. Ahead Judith reveals how you can re-create each sculptural statement piece.

The Ball Cabinet Hack: $220

The Supplies

Ivar cabinet

Wood paint of your choice

Untreated wood bowls

Bolts

A drill

A laser level

Aluminum round tubes

Wood glue

Step 1: Say So Long to Simple Pine

Paint the entire cabinet (inside and out). Judith used a black gloss wood paint. Once everything has dried assemble the product per IKEA’s instruction manual.

Step 2: Map Out Your Orbs

Measure the width and height of each cabinet panel and divide it by the amount of balls you want to use (Judith applied 60). “We used a laser level to establish the point at which the grid intersected which gave us the point for where each ball would go” notes the designer.

Step 3: Connect the Dots

Screw the wood balls onto the cabinet from the inside. (It can be helpful to carve out a small hole in the sphere beforehand using a thin drill.) “This was really the only option to secure them in a lasting way” says Judith. “Nonetheless my son managed to pull some off by using it as a climbing wall when he was learning to walk.” Apply a touch of wood glue to the predrilled holes if you really want to secure them.

From there you can paint over the balls or leave them as is. Judith ended up liking the way the matte orbs seemed to reflect the light coming from the glossy doors.

Step 4: Give It a Boost

Screw in eight bolts to the base of the cabinet (Judith bought these round ones so they could attach to the legs). Then slide your aluminum round tubes onto the bolts. The couple ordered one long pipe from eBay and asked the supplier to cut it into individual pieces for an extra fee. In order to protect your floors consider adding tubing plugs to the bottom of the new legs.

Finally Judith and Timothy unscrewed the spindle-looking legs from Pretty Pegs that they had previously stuck on the piece and filled the unit with records video games extension cords and occasional candles and glassware.

The Relief Ivars: $96

The Supplies

IKEA Ivar cabinet Foam Scissors Paper Wood glue Pencil Paint of your choice

Step 1: Say So Long to Simple Pine (Again)

Paint the cabinets in your desired color. Judith used Crown Paint’s Fine Silk in a gloss finish to contrast with the matte paint on the walls.

Step 2: Get in Shape

Sketch out some shapes that you think you might want. It can be helpful to do this using your phone or an iPad so you can overlay your drawings on a photo of the cabinet. Alternatively you can simply draw them out on a piece of draft paper. Judith focused on translating some of the silhouettes she had seen at Brâncusi’s Paris studio into her design.

Step 3: Take a Look at Your Templates

Print out your shapes (or cut them out if you went analog) and tape them to the cabinets so you can make sure the sizes and placement are to your liking.

Step 4: Solidify Your New Sculptures

Once you have fine-tuned the look lay your paper shapes on top of the foam sheets and cut out the 3D silhouettes. Glue those foam pieces to the cabinet and paint everything the color of your choosing (a standard wall paint will do but note that the foam may require a few coats).

While her relief Ivars lasted a few years Judith’s son eventually became obsessed with peeling them off the doors. If she were to do it again she’d ditch the foam for thin sheets of plywood or MDF. “You could cut out the pieces with a jigsaw or have them professionally done with a CNC machine” she shares. “After gluing them onto your piece of furniture I would then use some wood filler or caulk to fill the gap between the product and the shape.” No one will ever guess it all started with an IKEA run.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjdHYxOC5jb20vd29ybGQvbWFuLWZsaWVzLWZyb20tdWstdG8taXRhbHktZm9yLXBpenphLXRyaXAtY29zdHMtaGltLWxlc3MtdGhhbi1oaXMtZG9taW5vcy1vcmRlci1iaWxsLTE1ODU2MDcxLmh0bdIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjdHYxOC5jb20vd29ybGQvbWFuLWZsaWVzLWZyb20tdWstdG8taXRhbHktZm9yLXBpenphLXRyaXAtY29zdHMtaGltLWxlc3MtdGhhbi1oaXMtZG9taW5vcy1vcmRlci1iaWxsLTE1ODU2MDcxLmh0bS9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Man flies from UK to Italy for pizza,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMigAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjdHYxOC5jb20vd29ybGQvbWFuLWZsaWVzLWZyb20tdWstdG8taXRhbHktZm9yLXBpenphLXRyaXAtY29zdHMtaGltLWxlc3MtdGhhbi1oaXMtZG9taW5vcy1vcmRlci1iaWxsLTE1ODU2MDcxLmh0bdIBhAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbmJjdHYxOC5jb20vd29ybGQvbWFuLWZsaWVzLWZyb20tdWstdG8taXRhbHktZm9yLXBpenphLXRyaXAtY29zdHMtaGltLWxlc3MtdGhhbi1oaXMtZG9taW5vcy1vcmRlci1iaWxsLTE1ODU2MDcxLmh0bS9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025625B91450>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

15 Thomas Ramos: Was his usual dependable self at the back for Les Bleus and solid off the kicking tee although he was off target with one of his penalty attempts. 6/10

14 Damian Penaud: Was put in the clear by Ramos but dropped the ball close to Italy’s try-line during the early stages of the match. Despite that setback Penaud tested Italy’s defence with some fine runs but couldn’t cross the whitewash. 6

13 Gael Fickou: Although the home side put France‘s backs under pressure with several attacks they were kept in check for most of the game with Fickou amongst his team’s best defenders with 15 tackles made. Also made his mark on attack with 66 metres gained. 8

12 Yoram Moefana: Looked dangerous with ball in hand during the early stages of this Test but was less effective as the match progressed. Although he finished with 47 attacking metres he did not make the same impact when defending and only completed three hits during a full 80 minutes. 6

11 Ethan Dumortier: It was a memorable day for the Lyon flyer as he crossed for a well-taken try in the first half but he had few attacking opportunities after that and wasn’t very visible on defence. 6

10 Romain Ntamack: Was prominent on attack during the first half and did brilliantly with inch perfect cross-field kicks which resulted in tries for Ramos and Dumortier but like the rest of the Les Bleus squad was less influential after the break. Was eventually replaced by Matthieu Jalibert after 65 minutes. 7

9 Antoine Dupont: Another fine display from the French captain who was named as the official man of the match. Did what was expected of him in providing a slick service to his outside backs and made some fine line breaks finishing with 52 metres made. Also impressed with his leadership as he did not panic when Italy came back strongly in the second half and also shone on defence with 12 hits. 8

Solid effort under pressure from the pack

8 Gregory Alldritt: Another strong performance from the La Rochelle stalwart although he will be kicking himself for not preventing Ange Capuozzo from scoring his try. Despite that Alldritt was influential on attack gaining 72 metres and completed 14 tackles. Replaced after 62 minutes. 7

7 Charles Ollivon: The Toulon man was yellow carded for a professional foul close to his try-line which resulted in Italy receiving a penalty try but apart from that infringement he put in a solid effort. Was a willing ball carrier and also did his bit on defence. 7

6 Anthony Jelonch: Combined well with Alldritt and Ollivon especially during the first half when France held the upper hand. Had little impact on attack but put his body on the line on defence and finished with a match-high 20 tackles while also winning one turnover. 7

5 Paul Willemse: Made his return to international action but did not really catch the eye during his 54-minute stint on the field. Seldom got over the advantage line as a ball carrier but had a strong defensive game with 12 tackles made. 6

4 Thibaud Flament: The Toulouse second-row delivered a busy shift and was rewarded when he crossed for the opening try after charging down a Stephen Varney kick. Continued to impress as the match progressed especially on defence where he finished with 17 hits. 7

3 Uini Antonio: Was put under pressure in the scrums but stood up well to the task. Also did well with some strong carries and put his body on the line in defence. Replaced early in the second half. 6

2 Julien Marchand: Did well in the execution of his core duties and was a prominent ball carrier finishing with 33 metres gained but also shone on defence with 13 hits. 7

1 Cyril Baille: Another solid shift at the coalface of his side’s forward effort. Was solid in the scrums but made his biggest impact as a ball carrier with 33 metres made from 11 carries. Also did his it on defence with eight tackles and like Antonio replaced on 52 minutes. 7

But what impact is this likely to have?

“If you had the choice would you choose to live at the top of a 30m block with just one staircase?”

This question posed by Suzannah Nichol chief executive of Build UK to Building cuts to the heart of the reasoning behind the government’s latest building safety announcement.

Nearly six years after the Grenfell fire the public understandably lacks confidence in the industry’s ability to make tall buildings safe. New legislation has been designed to ensure that such a disaster never happens again but is it enough? There is a prevailing view that people living in tower blocks will continue to feel unsafe unless multiple means of escape are provided in new developments.

On 23 December as the country wound down for Christmas the Department for Levelling Up Housing and Communities (DLUHC) pushed out a short consultation paper proposing a number of amendments to Approved Document B of the Building Safety Regulations. The most eye-catching was a blanket ban on single staircases in new blocks above 30m in height (equivalent to around 10 storeys in a standard residential building).

The announcement has certainly caught a lot of industry experts off guard. After all banning buildings of a certain height with just a single staircase was not recommended in Dame Judith Hackitt’s review of building regulations in 2018. So when did the idea find favour with government ministers?

Those following the building safety debate closely will have noticed the government’s letter to building control bodies last August warning of “the need for robust evidence-based design by suitably competent professionals” in situations such as “tall residential buildings proposed with a single stair”. However this guidance stopped short of an outright ban.

One could have been forgiven for thinking the government was content to take a less prescriptive and a more evidence-based approach given all the other requirements coming down the line through regulations under the Building Safety Act.

However with the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) calling for a ban on single-staircase towers (albeit over 18m in height) Grenfell campaigners’ calling for second staircases and public opposition forcing the withdrawal of planning applications for single staircase developments perhaps it is not surprising that the government now wants to go down this route. “A minimum of two protected staircases provides additional escape routes for residents and additional access routes for firefighters” the NFCC has said.

The case for second staircases in new blocks The National Fire Chiefs Council argues second staircases should be mandatory in blocks above 18m in height. In a fire it says “a correctly designed second staircase removes the risk of a single point of failure buying critical time for firefighting activities and providing residents with multiple escape routes.” Fire chiefs point to London Fire Brigade figures which show that nearly 8500 residents chose to evacuate buildings rather than stay put between 1 April 2019 and 31 March 2022. The Department for Levelling Up Housing & Communities said in its consultation paper in December: “The provisions of a second staircase can provide some benefits for very tall residential buildings such as added resilience for extreme events and reduced conflicts between emergency responders entering a building and those trying to escape reducing the risk of the smoke ingress into an “escape” stairwell.” It said a second staircase would also provide a second means of escape if one route is filled with smoke.

So with the publication of details of a proposed ban and with a little under two months left of the consultation period how is the construction and housebuilding industry responding?

What challenges are firms likely to face in putting in second staircases? And are there likely to be any negative unintended consequences of a new rule which on the face of it seems like common sense?

Calls for clarity

The first thing to mention is that confusion over the approach to take has been ongoing for a while. The government letter last August warned building control bodies against relying on the current Approved Document B to approve single staircases in tall buildings and said specific evidence to justify such a decision should be sought such as a “detailed fire engineering analysis”.

The Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) has welcomed the consultation paper. Last summer it criticised the government on this issue for a lack of clarity.

Simon Allford president of RIBA said: “We urgently require building regulations and guidance to set out a clearly defined height threshold at which two or more staircases are necessary… until we have that definition we cannot move forward with certainty.”

Would the government’s proposed 30m ban clarify things?

Simon Bayliss managing partner at HTA Design said it would be useful for the government to demonstrate with evidence to what extent buildings of different heights are safer with a second staircase. After all while the 30m rule would be followed by industry if it were implemented the evidence base would surely inform firms’ decisions about buildings under the threshold also.

“Why are we pursuing this route? What has led Michael Gove to believe it [that single staircases should be banned] is it because the fire chiefs have recommended it? But the fire chiefs have recommended over 18m so even now there is not a consensus” says Bayliss.

Neil Jefferson managing director of the Home Builders Federation agrees. He says: “We have a situation where the NFCC are stipulating an 18m threshold and DLUHC a 30m one. It is causing nervousness both in the public and private sectors as to which guidance to follow for schemes moving forward.”

Jefferson says HBF members generally support the second staircase principle but need clarity on which guidance to follow along with transitional arrangements to ensure housing delivery is not affected.

Bayliss says the proposed 30m limit would be a “sensible cut-off” as a lower limit of 18m would have a much more dramatic impact affecting “almost every [tower block] project in London”.

The consultation

Andrew Mellor partner at architect PRP and a Building the Future commissioner questions the lack of detail in the government’s short consultation paper.

Mellor recently wrote: “The consultation does not provide a full understanding as to whether the second staircase will need to be an escape staircase a firefighting staircase or an accommodation staircase – or perhaps all of these.” He says the industry needs sight of the new guidance as soon as possible before the introduction of the changes.

The short consultation period which is running for 12 weeks but was effectively shorter as it encompassed the Christmas break also means the industry does not have long to submit its own evidence. And the lack of evidence does nothing to placate those who feel the 30m rule could have unintended consequences for fire safety.

Staircases alongside other safety measures

While nobody would argue that putting in a second staircase would make a building more unsafe there are concerns that the requirement could prove a distraction from looking at fire safety in the round. Simon Tolson senior partner at Fenwick Elliott and a Building the Future commissioner says the 30m rule seems “kneejerk”.

He adds: “The design of passive fire protection measures such as travel distances compartmentation fire stopping and number of stairs should always be balanced with active systems such as smoke ventilation automatic detection alarms sprinklers fire curtains and evacuation policy.”

He adds that he suspects there will be “many single-storey tall buildings that are ultimately safer than mandated two-staircase buildings.”

Adam Eaton director of fire safety at Hydrock points out that the various provisions in the Building Safety Act with its gateway points duty holder requirements and the golden thread of information should give confidence that buildings are more safe than before.

He says the requirement for an evacuation alert system in buildings over 18m high sprinklers over 11m and the tightening up of the use of combustible materials in external walls all need to be considered when looking at fire safety.

Eaton says: “If all these factors – the evacuation alert system the sprinkler systems the non-combustible external walls – are designed correctly and the single staircase does not connect with any risk areas then in many cases the single staircase would still be considered safe in my mind.”

Given the need to get all of these factors right Eaton is concerned that a second staircase may be seen as a panacea that indirectly leads to other things being neglected particularly with the ongoing maintenance of buildings.

If all these factors – the evacuation alert system the sprinkler systems the non-combustible external walls – are designed correctly and the single staircase does not connect with any risk areas then in many cases the single staircase would still be considered safe in my mind Adam Eaton Hydrock

“The danger is somebody could think it doesn’t matter if for instance there are failings with fire doors because there is a second staircase. But you may only have a single fire door in the centre of the corridor and if there is something wrong with it you could get smoke spread in two directions towards both staircases.”

He warns there is a danger that people could become “less attentive to the detail within the building” and that a blanket 30m rule does not consider the nuances of building safety design. Eaton says the 30m rule could also cause anxiety to residents who live in current tall blocks that won’t be affected by the new rule.

Practicalities of second staircases

Regardless of where you stand on the debate if the government amends building regulations as proposed then the industry would have no choice but to crack on and ensure second staircases are included in buildings over 30m in height even if firms opt for single staircases in buildings between 18m and 30m in defiance of the fire chiefs. So what impact will this have?

In the short term schemes with 30m blocks that have had planning but have yet to start on site would have to be revised with fresh planning consents needed.

Bayliss says: “We have a project at the moment with around 20 buildings in total three of which are over 30 storeys. We will have to revise the planning application and this will delay the project for about a year so that’s a dramatic impact.”

Redrawing and submitting a revised planning application would be timely and use resources but this cost would only be part of much bigger expenditure facing developers switching from single-staircase to two-staircase development.

Incorporating a full second staircase reduces the area of the building that can be sold or rented out reducing the value of the development if all else is equal. Then there is the cost of creating a larger building to accommodate the additional stair core and potentially extra building on top of that to compensate for the loss of saleable area.

James Clark partner at Core Five (see below) says the value lost by reducing saleable area to incorporate a second staircase outweighs the cost of adding extra area to compensate by around four times as much. Therefore one consequence of the 30m rule could see developers opting for bulkier blocks than they might have gone with had the rule not been introduced.

Why the 30m rule is likely to result in bulkier (and possibly taller) tower blocks What would be the financial impact of developing a two-staircase block as opposed to one with a single staircase? James Clark at Core Five takes the example of a typical high-rise development with a floorplate of 8500ft2 and assumes a sales value of £2000 per ft2. He says an additional staircase would take up around 215ft2 per storey. If no area is added to the building there will therefore be a loss of value of around £425000 per storey assuming that where a second staircase is introduced a corresponding amount of saleable area is also lost. However if additional saleable area is added to the building to compensate by making the tower bulkier this would cost around £100000 per storey. Therefore it makes sense to make the floor plate bigger to recoup the £425000 lost per storey through reduced saleable space. He says: “It is reasonably safe to say that the value multiplier is roughly four times the cost of creating the area – which is why it makes sense to do it”. Clark says another option is to add on storeys to the building rather than increasing its footprint but the value multiplier will be less as the stair cores will eat into the amount of saleable area. However if the floor plate becomes bigger architects may want to make the building taller anyway to achieve the “slenderness” ratio they desire.

Bayliss agrees that developers will be looking to create more saleable area. He suggests that while the rules may favour the development of blocks below the 30m threshold – to avoid the second staircase issue – they are also likely to lead to a greater proportion of blocks significantly above 30m.

“Once you get above the height of 30m you’d be pushing to go as high as possible to help pay for it” he says.

Bayliss also says towers will have bigger footprints to accommodate the extra stair cores and this would lead to more height being required to “get to an ideal slenderness ratio… it will drive architectural form”.

Another possibility of course is that the drop in saleable area in buildings could cause developers to ensure viability in other ways such as seeking to cut back on the proportion of affordable housing in developments.

This is recognised in the government consultation paper which says the viability impact is “likely to reduce the amount of affordable housing that can be provided by developers”.

Paul Hackett chief executive of 77000-home housing association Southern Housing and chair of the G15 group of London housing associations is well aware of these concerns. He says it is important buildings have proper means of escape but also warns that it is key to ensure “we don’t end up with socially and economically segregated developments”.

“Once you get above the height of 30 metres you’d be pushing to go as high as possible to help pay for it” Simon Bayliss HTA

He adds: “If land value isn’t sufficient to support the plan-compliant level of affordable housing as a consequence of putting in an extra staircase in a tall building then I would say there’s an argument for using government funding to achieve it if viability tests can prove that grant funding is required.”

While affordable housing may suffer one other impact to consider is the extra carbon impact of putting a second concrete stair core into a building.

Matthew Pygott a principal carbon consultant at Hydrock says it is not easy to estimate the carbon impact of a second staircase as “every building is different”. For instance says Pygott the impact would be higher if the footprint of the building were expanded and the whole structure increased – along with associated materials – than if the floorplates were cut into.

He says: “One thing that should be guaranteed is that if a second staircase is needed then carbon reduction savings should be pushed in other areas and lean design principles put at the forefront of every design choice.”

The second staircase rule then has the potential to disrupt build plans in the short term and in the longer term could have significant impact on design affordable housing development and net zero in high-rise blocks. So is it worth it?

“With society understandably concerned about what is safe and what is not and finding it difficult to determine the difference the government feels something must be done to secure confidence in the built environment” says Clark.

This may be the case but many industry professionals still believe that any decision to mandate second staircases should be rooted in evidence. To them it seems the government has shifted from calling for “robust evidence-based design” to a blanket ban on single staircases without fully demonstrating the case for it.

If the proposals do go ahead the key challenge for the construction and housebuilding industry will be to ensure that putting in second staircases does not inadvertently lead to complacency around other fire safety measures and long-term maintenance neglect. It will also need to ensure the rule does not hamper affordable housing development and net zero efforts.

The stakes could not be higher. In many ways the second staircase debate is a microcosm of the building safety question more generally that the Building the Future Commission is addressing. And that is: how does the country build the homes and create the communities it needs while ensuring that every possible proportionate measure has been taken to make buildings safe?"

Two bills — SB 77 andHB 2174 — were drafted by officials in Roeland Park which has struggled for years to fully eliminate racist deed restrictions that are now illegal to implement but remain stubbornly on the books of some now-defunct homeowners’ associations’ bylaws.

The legislation is garnering support from other cities including Overland Park and Lawrence and is also drawing attention in Prairie Village which has dealt with its own legacy of racist housing covenants. Prairie Village will have its diversity committee discuss the issue at its meeting this month.

Cities would have more power to remove racist language

Roeland Park City Administrator Keith Moody said the city’s main issue has been the fact that there are no more active homeowners associations in Roeland Park.

Current state law says only HOAs can remove discriminatory language from their bylaws and if there is no active HOA there is no agency to do that and nobody to hold accountable for racist language that remains on the books Moody said.

The bills introduced in Topeka this week would change state law to allow cities “to redact the discriminatory language from either the plat or a set of covenants and restrictions recorded with the plat.”

State Sen. Ethan Corson a Democrat from Fairway and state Rep. Rui Xu a Democrat from Westwood introduced the bills in their respective chambers.

While such racially restrictive covenants are no longer legally enforceable Corson said he thinks it is still important to give cities and counties the option to remove the language to reaffirm the community’s commitment to diversity and inclusivity.

“I think it’s a painful vestige for the bad parts of our history where this happened” Corson said.

Xu said it’s important to show specifically Black and Jewish members of the community “this is certainly not something our neck of the woods stands for.”

“I can only imagine being Black or Jewish and then owning a house with this type of language on your deed and the strong desire for it to be gone” Xu said.

Covenants locked out Black and Jewish homebuyers

Juliana Garcia / Shawnee Mission Post A home in Roeland Park which now no longer has any active homeowners’ associations.

Driven by developers like J.C. Nicholsnortheast Johnson County’s population exploded nearly a century ago but many of these new planned subdivisions came with restrictions that explicitly excluded Black and Jewish homebuyers.

In a letter in support of the new legislation Roeland Park officials included language from one of the city’s defunct homeowners’ associations that said homes should never be sold or rented to “any person of Negro blood or [to] any person who is more than one-fourth of the Semitic race blood origin or extraction.”

“The need for change is obvious” the city’s letter reads. “We should not tolerate even the remnants of racism.”

The Senate bill is scheduled for a hearing Feb. 9

Corson said the hearing before the Senate Federal and State Affairs Committee will include testimony from cities realtors and hopefully community members.

“We’re pleased to hear it’s going to have a hearing we’re hopeful that that will result in it being moved out of committee and given an opportunity for a vote on the floor of the Senate” Moody said.

Xu said he’s not heard any backlash or negative comments on this bill and he doesn’t anticipate much opposition.

Why Trust Us?

Elizabeth Hurley 55 recently rocked a stunning sparkly gown in an Instagram photo.

The dress featured a dramatic keyhole cutout.

Hurley glowed in the snap and we’re sharing some of her go-to skincare favorites.

Even though Elizabeth Hurley loves to post stunning swimsuit selfies and is very comfortable posting bikini photos the 57-year-old supermodel’s sense of style away from the beach is one for the books. Case in point: Hurley’s recent dramatic Instagram post in which she wears a black bodycon sparkly dress complete with a daring plunging keyhole detail.



In the photo the Bedazzled star poses while leaning against a staircase with a slight smile. She opted to forego statement jewelry to truly let the dress shine and styled her hair in loose waves cascading down her shoulders. “Come up and see me some time ❤️” the actress cheekily captioned the post.

Comments instantly started rolling in with fans showering the star with compliments. “Wow you look stunning. What a gorgeous dress” wrote one fan. Another wrote “😍🔥You only get more beautiful 👏.” One fan even called her “The most beautiful woman on the planet” while another wrote “Even in black and white you color my world! ❤️”

This gorgeous photo isn’t the first time Hurley has gone for a glittery look. Only last month the star floored fans with a daring sparkly New Year’s outfit to welcome 2023 in style. “Here’s to 2023 and hoping everyone’s dreams come true ❤️❤️” she captioned the Instagram post. She wore a nude bodysuit embellished with gemstones and crystals galore and we couldn’t help but notice its resemblance to a bikini which Hurley is known to pose in for various bikini Instagram videos and swimsuit photos.

And while there’s absolutely no denying Hurley’s recent ensembles are stunning we can’t help but notice how radiant the star looks in each and every pic she posts—and we’re not talking about the glitter. So how does she maintain her glow?

First and foremost the bikini queen is sure to always use sunscreen. Hurley previously revealed her go-to sunscreen in a sunny Instagram photo—the Clinique Broad Spectrum SPF 50 Sunscreen Face Cream which she called her “trusty SPF 50.” She also once shared her favorite lip balm that keeps her pout hydrated the Clinique Moisture Surge Lip Hydro-Plump Treatment.

Hurley also uses a few other products to maintain her radiant complexion. She is a big fan of Estée Lauder products and told Yahoo Lifestyle that the brand’s Advanced Night Repair is her “most favorite product of all” which she uses twice a day. Meanwhile the Estée Lauder RE-NUTRIV Ultimate Lift Regenerating Youth Eye Creme takes the cake as her favorite eye cream .

It turns out that a viral disco ball-style cowboy hat that Beyoncé wore in her Rennaisance tour announcement has local roots.

A photo announcing the tour dates including a Philly show at Lincoln Financial Field was posted featuring a photo of Queen Bey clad in a mirror-tiled cowboy hat and matching outfit as she rides a sparkly disco horse.

But while most fans who saw the photo were freaking out about the tour Abby Misbin and her friends were focused on the singer’s outfit.

Misbin 24 of Fairmount is the owner of Trending by Abby a cowboy hat decorating Etsy shop that has gained a customer base in outfitting bachelorette parties birthday bashes and college football tailgates. It was her hat that donned Beyoncé's head.

In early June Misbin said Bea Åkerlund — one of Beyoncé's stylists — contacted her on Etsy to purchase one of her top sellers: a cowboy hat covered in mirror tiles. It would be a quick turnaround but Åkerlund said it was for Bey herself.

“It didn’t sound real to me at first” Misbin told The Inquirer during a phone interview Sunday which she took while working on fulfilling hat orders. “I figured it was a scam but I got paid so there wasn’t a risk. She was very specific about what she wanted the hat to look like. I offer crystal trim and lights. They didn’t want any of that — they had a vision.”

Recruiting the BeyHive

Months had gone by and although Misbin and her friends and family knew she had maybe possibly outfitted Beyoncé it wasn’t clear whether the rest of the world would ever find out.

In August the music video teaser for Beyoncé's song “I’m That Girl” dropped. It featured a short snippet of Bey wearing Misbin’s creation. The only problem? No one knew Misbin was responsible.

“I don’t think people believed me” she recalled. “I had to tell them it was mine.”

Cut to last week when Misbin woke up to a swarm of messages from a group chat with her friends. There it was: Beyoncé was wearing the hat prominently in her major tour announcement which was shared across all major social media platforms. The photo has been liked more than eight million times on Instagram alone.

Still Misbin felt a case of “Deja Vu.” She worried that people wouldn’t believe it was her hat atop the queen’s head because she wasn’t tagged.

So she and her friends sought out the BeyHive — Beyoncé's ride-or-die fan group — to let them know the source of the singer’s disco cowboy crown.

The plan worked. Not only was Misbin getting credit she was making dozens of sales.

From side hustle to full-time job

Misbin who said she’s always enjoyed crafting hobbies launched Trending by Abby in 2020 as a side hustle while pursuing a marketing degree at Temple University.

Her first sale was a $40 hat that the customer ended up returning. “It’s funny to look back on now” she said. “Thankfully I don’t have many returns these days.”

The business picked up slowly with custom orders for the colorful campy over-the-top cowboy hats.

“All customers deserve Beyoncè quality.” Abby Misbin

After graduating in 2021 Misbin went full time with hat decorating. Even before the Beyoncé boom Misbin said she made enough from hat decorating to sustain herself.

“The business has been surprisingly lucrative” she said. “I have a lot of loyal customers. It started off slow but has really grown.”

Misbin said she doesn’t have to put her marketing degree to use either. She has enough organic and returning clientele that she doesn’t need to pay for marketing or worry about maintaining her business’ social media presence.

“Before Beyoncé I had people buying a ton of disco hats” she said. “It was my top seller.”

A labor of love: gluing thousands of glass tiles onto hats

Once word got out that Misbin was responsible for Beyoncé's hat the orders came rolling in. But they’re not exactly a quick item to produce.

Each hat priced at a base of $285 — or more depending on add-ons — is covered in thousands of individually placed glass mirror tiles. The whole process takes six to seven hours to complete. Misbin said she can make at most 2½ a day.

“I sold 60 or 70 the first day Beyoncé's tour announcement happened and I realized pretty quickly that if I don’t stop this people aren’t going to get them” she said. She likened this week of orders to the surges in orders she experiences in October ahead of Halloween season. But with orders being completely customized Misbin said she can’t begin crafting a hat until it’s ordered.

Every so often Misbin opens a handful of orders again in the days since.

After Good Morning America ran a feature on Misbin’s hats she opened up 15 more order slots. They sold out in 20 minutes.

She’s also made some exceptions for customers with extenuating circumstances — such as a Super Bowl appearance.

“One girl offered to pay me three times the price if I could send her a hat tomorrow morning because she’s going to be at the Super Bowl and will be on or near the 50-yard line.” Another customer — the personal assistant of a celebrity whose daughter is a Beyoncé fan — reached out to order a hat on their behalf as a present. “Some people have such good stories I can’t say no.”

So instead of saying no she’s working 14 to 16 hours a day fulfilling orders from her parents’ basement in Ambler. She calls the space “the hat bunker.”

“My parents think this is nuts but they also think it’s nuts when they see the big rushes of hats and 20 boxes outside their front door” she said. “They’ve gotten more used to it but the Beyoncé thing is crazy.”

Still as things go on social media Misbin has also fallen subject to internet trolls and criticism.

Misbin refutes claims that she’s a “bag fumbler” she doesn’t want to scale up production

Across social media some people criticized Misbin for not being prepared to sell larger batches of hats once the Beyoncé announcement took off.

“I recently saw a ton of comments because TMZ ran a story with a headline that said I was ‘forced to shut down sales.’ I’m still making hats and selling them” she said. “But I can only make as many as I can.”

After that Misbin read comments from people saying that she “dropped the ball” and is losing out on potential money from additional sales. “It really annoyed me” she said.

One TikTok content creator called Misbin a “bag fumbler” because she didn’t scale up her production.

“[They criticized me] because I wasn’t ready to outsource or take out a loan to open a factory” she said. “But I don’t want to do that because I like making the hats. The whole reason I started this was because I like working with my hands. The misconception is I’m too stressed to do it and that’s the opposite of the case.”

The hat designer also said that she isn’t willing to sacrifice quality just to make things faster or cheaper.

She said some customers purchased hats from her after first purchasing lower-quality cheaper dupes. Misbin said the lower-quality hats can also be risky because disco mirror tiles are made out of glass. On her Instagram she put it simply: “All customers deserve Beyoncè quality.”

Supporters of Misbin’s business say they appreciate her approachability and the fact that she cares so much about the product. Misbin’s own TikTok response to critics garnered more than 1.5 million views on the platform.

Misbin said she has recruited the help of friends for back-end work such as folding boxes launching a newsletter to announce when sales open and cutting up mirror tiles. But she reserves the hat-making duties for herself.

Even though she’s tired she says the last week has been rewarding.

“I appreciate people who are willing to believe in me and wait for their order and understand that this is a labor of love for me” she said. “Even if some big company takes the idea and mass produces this I’m having a good time.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2JleW9uYy1zbGF5ZWQtaGFyZC1oZXItY293Ym95LTIwNTA0NDkyNS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Beyoncé Slayed So Hard In Her Cowboy Bikini Look For The Renaissance Tour Announcement That An Etsy Shop ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2JleW9uYy1zbGF5ZWQtaGFyZC1oZXItY293Ym95LTIwNTA0NDkyNS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000256282019C0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Since its foundations in remote 1940s Sweden Ikea evolved from a small catalog-based home essentials store into a one-stop shop for affordable furniture homewares and décor via Ikea. Its no-nonsense minimalistic approach allows it to sell household goods for a fraction of the price of other stores. The retailer's functional minimalistic designs make it a popular choice for people who want to furnish their homes on a budget while maintaining a cohesive sleek look.

Nowadays the store carries thousands of items at attractively low prices but it's not without its issues. When a store produces fast furniture — low-cost low-quality designs built only to last a few years — there's a high chance you could run into items that aren't worth the investment. To ensure your money is well spent we're looking at a few of the most popular dressers at Ikea so you can guarantee you end up with a piece you love even on a tight budget."

Critics say the researchers who authored the study are biased activists and their conclusions skewed to serve a political agenda and help with lawsuits against the company.

“There is sufficient ‘play’ and complexity in their methods that anyone getting expertise in this work probably stands to make some bank in the court cases for which this research is designed” tweeted University of Colorado – Boulder professor Roger Pielke Jr.

‘Internal Memos’

According to the study internal company memos show that scientists at ExxonMobil knew since the 1970s that carbon dioxide emissions could lead to global warming.

“In 2017 for instance we demonstrated that Exxon’s internal documents as well as peer-reviewed studies published by Exxon and ExxonMobil Corp. scientists overwhelmingly acknowledged that climate change is real and human-caused” the authors of the study write.

The lead authors Naomi Oreskes and Geoffrey Supran then pick examples from company memos and press release materials that express uncertainties.

For example in 2013 ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson said “There are other elements of the climate system that may obviate this one single variable [of burning fossil fuels] … And so that’s that uncertainty issue.”

In his Twitter thread on the study Pielke sums up its conclusion as “Decades ago ExxonMobil understood as much about climate change as did academic and government scientists.”

Mandi Risko spokesperson for Energy in Depth told Cowboy State Daily that the researchers are using a flawed 20/20 hindsight view that wants to hold scientists at Exxon accountable for forward-looking projections that tracked closely to real-life observations decades later.

The study’s ultimate conclusion which is that Exxon knew fossil fuels were contributing to climate change and should therefore be held liable in court hinges on a sample size of 12 climate models the study attributes to the company some going back as far as 1977.

Critics like Pielke have pointed out that these models are public information and can hardly be evidence of some secret knowledge the company had but withheld from the public.

One of the models is pulled from the Working Group 1 contribution of the third assessment of the International Panel on Climate Change a government consortium of the world’s leading climate scientists. More than 100 lead authors compiled the report and it was reviewed by 420 experts. It was then widely distributed among the scientific community and the public.

“Unfortunately what we’re dealing with here is a biased report authored by someone who serves as a paid consultant to the law firm bringing lawsuits across the country against domestic energy producers” Risko said.

Fundamentally Flawed

Supran was interviewed in 2021 by Bulletin of Atomic Scientists where he said “I’m proud to call myself both a scientist and an activist.”

In a 2016 tweet he encouraged engineers to be “the kind that engineers Exxon out of business.”

Oreskes was involved in the 2012 La Jolla conference in which activists and lawyers began plotting strategies to litigate against Exxon. She’s also a paid consultant for the law firm Sher Edling which is serving as outside counsel for more than a dozen states and municipalities that have filed climate lawsuits across the country.

This fact was disclosed in the latest study but received no mention in previous ones.

The researcher who wrote a book on the methodology of content analysis that Supran and Oreskes cited in their study had previously criticized them for the way in which they use the method calling it “fundamentally flawed.”

Risko said that once you consider the bias of the researchers their study is pretty much what you expect it to be. The methodology is thin and the internal company memos they cite were large reports often commissioned by governments that have been part of the public domain for decades where many outside people contributed and reviewed the content.

“There’s literally nothing in here that supports the thesis that the authors are working so hard to push” Risko said. “They don’t really show that Exxon knew. They show that Exxon wasn’t really sure.”

Simplistic Narrative

The study is not the first “Exxon Knew” campaign to try to paint the company as engaging in these kinds of deceptive tactics.

Rob Bradley founder and CEO of the American Institute for Energy Research and senior fellow of the Institute for Economic Research told Cowboy State Daily it’s a formula activists use to get headlines.

This newest study he said is the fourth or fifth iteration of the campaign.

Bradley said the authors take the work of Exxon researchers some of it from the 1970s and remove it from any historical context in what he described as “simplistic” and manipulative.

“They [the Exxon researchers] had no idea at the time it could be used for sinister purposes. Virtually no one paid attention to it. At the time they were finding one piece of the whole climate change puzzle and it was buried and forgotten. Because it just wasn’t important at the time” Bradley said.

Bradley maintains a free-market energy blog MasterResource which compiles multiple rebuttals to the “Exxon Knew” campaigns which were also carried out by Oreskes and Supran.

In each iteration of the effort they use the same methods to treat Exxon’s research as having a certainty early in the research that didn’t exist at all in climate science at the time.

“The predominance of anthropogenic global warming is now widely accepted as fact although amount timing and response remain open questions” Bradley wrote in one rebuttal along with a colleague Richard Fulmer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlbGVncmFwaC5jby51ay9lbnZpcm9ubWVudC8yMDIzLzAyLzA0L2V4eG9uLWtuZXctY291bGQtZGFtYWdpbmctcGxhbmV0LXJlc2VhcmNoLW5ldmVyLW1hZGUtcHVibGljL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exxon predicted climate change decades ago.

Think even bigger because the industry is booming with another 431 funds coming online last year. That asks a lot of advisors trying to find the signal in the ETF noise the focus of the ETF U: Sorting Through a Growing ETF Universe panel Sunday at Exchange: An ETF Experience where panelists including Bloomberg Senior ETF Analyst Eric Balchunas Factset ETF Research Director Elisabeth Kashner and CFRA Head of ETF Data and Analytics Aniket Ullal all shared their thoughts.

In such a vast world of ETFs it’s critical to parse the data into digestible bites – that’s how Factset approaches its ETF work according to Kashner describing each ETF with a fit score a letter grade and a story on their site with metrics like efficiency tradability and fit. She added that misunderstanding and choosing the wrong ETF invites tracking errors trading spreads and performance gaps.

“We’ve had years where the difference between the top and bottom ETF in a category is 60%. So getting that right really made a difference” Kasher said.

Factset allows advisors to compare strategies with an efficiency analysis as well in which for example the Invesco DWA Energy Momentum ETF (PXI) and the Vanguard Energy ETF (VDE) can be compared based on data points like median tracking difference fund closure risk derivative use and even average spreads. PXI for example has a near 25 basis point average spread while VHD has just a three basis point spread making it somewhat cheaper.

To Balchunas there are five factors in the ETF Due Diligence checklist to consider: exposure cost liquidity risk and scoring systems. To Balchunas it’s important to look at ETFs and score them based on risk factors that in some ways reflect movie ratings from G to rated R but at Bloomberg is called the ETF Traffic Light System rating strategies from red to yellow to green. He listed the risks contributing to those ratings including leverage potential future roll costs lack of liquidity and more.

“All the commodity ETFs sound so innocent but those roll costs will eat you alive. You’ll have made the right bet but made no money” Balchunas said comparing at least one strategy to Gremlins the cute buy monstrous creatures from the 1984 film.

What are some of the advantages of such a scoring system? It covers all ETFs Balchunas said adding speed and a recognition that most people don’t actually read prospectuses. Looking at so many different ETFs the fields in the Bloomberg Intelligence system can empower investors to see measures like purity in which revenue comes from pure play sources or ESG measured at Bloomberg Intelligence with ETFs scored with an E an S or a G.

Closing out the talk Ullal addressed CFRA’s own research process examining ETFs in a broader context. Considering model portfolios sector industry& thematic factors and market comment CFRA then looks closely at each given firm.

“What we do is take the entire ETF universe globally and classify it in granular ways” Ullal said. “Once we’ve done that we can get into other specific ETF comparisons and ETF level.”

CFRA uses machine learning to help produce the firm’s star ratings a one to a five-star system that is fed by information like sector performance and expenses versus other ETFs. To build the machine learning model CFRA analysts gather ratings of the underlying stocks and add forensic trends on top of earnings score and manager track record on top of industry trends. The star model is updated on a monthly basis with the firm having moderated the ratings so they don’t fluctuate wildly thanks to a smoothing algorithm.

“Over time it’s getting smarter; it’s learning through the data we’ve already compiled” Ullal said. “We really try to make sure the data’s diverse and it really represents what’s happening in the market.”

The tech titans posted earnings as shares in Meta skyrocketed a day after it reported better results than expected and signalled spending and job cuts.

The results follow weeks of unprecedented layoff rounds in the usually unassailable tech sector amid pessimism about the economic outlook.

The souring mood followed a long spell of outsized growth during the peak COVID-19 period when consumers went online for work shopping and entertainment.

“Big Tech calls from Apple Amazon and Alphabet painting a much different picture of demand environment than the tech bears were hoping for” tweeted Wedbush analyst Dan Ives referring to investors who believe shares are on a downward path.

While earnings reports show there is “caution in the air” there are signs that the companies could be heading for soft landings the analyst added.

Google parent Alphabet’s revenue of USD76 billion in its fourth quarter and profit of USD13.6 billion were below what it made in the same period a year earlier with share prices falling more than three per cent in after-market trade.

Google saw a slump in its crucial advertising sales which were slightly better than analysts had projected according to data compiled by Factset.

“It’s clear that after a period of significant acceleration in digital spending during the pandemic the macro economic climate has become more challenging” Google CEO Sundar Pichai said in an earnings call.

Pichai last month announced a plan to lay off 12000 employees in order to reverse pandemic over-hiring and focus on new areas especially artificial intelligence.

Google was caught off guard by the sudden rise of user-friendly AI such as ChatGPT which is seen as a potential rival to Google’s popular search engine.

Apple is the only US tech giant that has not announced major layoffs in recent weeks.

The world’s biggest company in terms of market value reported a fall in quarterly revenue and profits for the final three months last year hit by a drop in sales of its flagship iPhones.

Apple sales were hit by curtailed production at factories due to China’s zero-COVID policy that was only recently lifted.

“COVID-19 related challenges” that “significantly” reduced Apple’s supply of iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max lasted through most of December Apple chief executive Tim Cook said on an earnings call.

Apple’s revenue was USD117.1 billion down 5.4 per cent from a year ago for the same quarter a year earlier missing what analysts had forecast.

“The world continues to face unprecedented circumstances from inflation to war in Eastern Europe to the enduring impacts of the pandemic and we know that Apple is not immune to it” Cook said.

Amazon meanwhile reported an inflation-fuelled increase in sales despite the company announcing a massive round of layoffs to correct for a hiring binge during the pandemic when business growth ramped up.

“During periods of economic uncertainty consumers are very careful about how they allocate their resources and where they choose to spend their money” Amazon chief financial officer Brian Olsavsky said on an earnings call.

“We saw them spend less on discretionary categories and shift to lower priced items in value brands in categories like electronics.”

Last month the company said it would let go more than 18000 employees after the workforce swelled by 800000 employees during the peak years of the pandemic period.

Amazon’s sales figures of USD149.2 billion in the quarter were better than initial forecasts by analysts polled by Factset but its profit took a massive hit falling to near zero.

“In the short term we face an uncertain economy but we remain quite optimistic about the long-term opportunities for Amazon” said CEO Andy Jassy.

The Big Tech earnings dump came a day after Meta said quarterly sales dropped one per cent which beat expectations and announced that the number of daily users on Facebook hit two billion for the first time.

Armando Montelongo Jr. who starred on the A&E series “Flip This House” for three seasons was unable to get lawsuits brought by former students of his house-flipping seminars dropped the San Antonio Express-News reported. The Texas Supreme Court declined to hear Montelongo’s appeal and didn’t give a reason why.

More than 400 people who attended Montelongo’s seminars filed a lawsuit claiming he provided “worthless dangerous and unlawful information” and took advantage of the students. The plaintiffs are seeking at least $15 million in damages.

According to the lawsuit Montelongo capitalized on the fame he found after portraying the stressful San Antonio real estate market from 2006 to 2008 on TV to promote his house-flipping seminars.

Montelongo was first taken to federal court in California when about 160 students alleged he and his classes had drained them of their life savings destroyed marriages and even led one person to die by suicide. Montelongo claimed the San Francisco court didn’t have jurisdiction to hear it and the plaintiffs refiled the case in federal court in San Antonio in late 2016.

After a judge dismissed claims that Montelongo engaged in racketeering the plaintiffs then refiled this time accusing him and his three companies — Real Estate Training International Performance Advantage Group and License Branding — of using deceptive trade practices and negligence.

Montelongo responded to the lawsuit via Twitter saying “To the 350 now 420 I have stood relatively silently by because I understand that there is prosperity in peace But now your (sic) simple minded” he wrote. “Hatred will understand the expense of war. I do not wish you good luck but you will need it. Because you will feel the full brunt of my Capabilities and a resolve that you have never dealt with. You are following extremely weak leaders who will now lead you down the path 2 bk (bankruptcy).”

This year David Hokin a FedEx Express courier with 36 years of service had the honor of delivering the Vince Lombardi Trophy to the Super Bowl Experience Presented by Lowe’s. Awaiting Hokin’s key delivery was Super Bowl LII Champion Zach Ertz. Together the duo showcased the trophy in front of NFL fans and media before inviting attendees to snap a photo with it.

The historic Vince Lombardi Trophy which was handcrafted by artisans at Tiffany & Co. is made of sterling silver and depicts a regulation-size football in kicking position on a pyramid-like base that features the words ‘Vince Lombardi Trophy’ and ‘Super Bowl LVII’ along with the NFL shield.

Fans in the Phoenix area can stop by and view the trophy up close at the Super Bowl Experience Presented by Lowe’s starting Saturday Feb. 4 & Sunday Feb. 5 and again on Thursday Feb. 9 – Saturday Feb. 11 at the Phoenix Convention Center. On Sunday Feb. 12 it will be awarded to either the Kansas City Chiefs or Philadelphia Eagles commemorating the Super Bowl LVII Champion for the 2022-2023 NFL season.

It is important to note a limitation related to ADS-B altitude values in situations close to the ground. The altitude reported by ADS-B data is a barometric value above mean sea level (AMSL) calibrated at standard atmospheric pressure. It is not the height of the aircraft above the ground. The aircraft’s radio altimeter would be providing the pilots with the aircraft’s height above the ground at this stage of flight.

At the closest point horizontally the aircraft were less than 1000 feet apart but we do not have same-time data points in order to calculate an exact figure. It is also important to note that the position broadcast via ADS-B is from a specific point on the aircraft and parts of the aircraft may be closer or further to the other aircraft than the place from which the GPS position is derived.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDdhdXN0aW4uY29tL3ZpZGVvLzExNzYzNTTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Crash between Southwest flight FedEx cargo plane narrowly averted at Austin-Bergstrom,"Crash between Southwest flight FedEx cargo plane narrowly averted at Austin-Bergstrom

The incident occurred at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport Saturday morning after an air traffic controller cleared a Boeing 737 operated by Southwest Airlines to depart according to the Federal Aviation Administration. However a Boeing 767 cargo plane operated by FedEx was also cleared to land when it was ""several miles from the airport.""

""Shortly before the FedEx aircraft was due to land the controller cleared Southwest Flight 708 to depart from the same runway"" said the FAA. ""The pilot of the FedEx airplane discontinued the landing and initiated a climb out.""

The National Transportation Safety Board called the incident in a tweet a ""possible runway incursion and overflight.""

Flight data from Flightradar24 shows the two planes coming close on the runway.

The FAA and NTSB said they are investigating the incident.

FedEx said in a statement to USA TODAY that its cargo plane arriving from Memphis landed safely at the airport ""after encountering an event."" The Southwest Airlines flight left Austin 15 minutes after its scheduled departure but arrived to its destination in Cancun Mexico early according to FlightAware data.

Southwest Airlines and FedEx referred questions to federal officials.

The close call comes after a similar incident occurred at John F. Kennedy International Airport in January. A preliminary investigation from the FAA found a Delta Air Lines had stop its takeoff roll after an American Airlines flight had crossed the runway from an adjacent taxiway. Days after the near-collision a JetBlue plane struck the tail of a parked aircraft at the same airport.

A Swiss startup has developed photovoltaic (PV) solar panels that can be placed on railway systems with the potential to generate mass amounts of energy across Switzerland's more than 4300 miles of railway.

The company Sun-Ways is expected to bring its first solar railways online in May starting with part of a track owned by the Swiss rail operator Transports Publics Neuchâtelois SA. The panels will sit in the spaces between the tracks meaning trains will literally be driving over them as they pass by.

The initial rollout will occupy about 360 feet. The pre-assembled panels are rolled out onto the railway in a manner similar to unrolling a carpet and can be easily moved when it's time for maintenance and repairs.

According to Sun-Ways 10 kilometers (around six miles) of railway tracks can house 5000 of its solar modules and produce two gigawatt hours of solar energy every year — enough to power 20 million light bulbs. This would bring the cost of electricity to about ten cents per KWh — about half the price of conventional electricity in the U.S.

The tech has the potential to help generate renewable energy reducing pressure on the grid without the need for dirty energy sources like oil and gas which are a leading source of pollution and planet-warming carbon. Europe is home to approximately 162000 miles of railway and globally there are more than 720000 miles of railroad tracks so it's a huge resource for energy-generating potential.

The solar energy panels are feeding into the grid but could also eventually power the trains themselves.

""[T]he ideal would be to feed the electricity into the railway network"" a Sun-Ways spokesperson told PV Magazine. ""We know there are engineering development projects trying to build an efficient transformer that will make this possible. With this solution there would be no problem with the cable length as the feed would be done directly into the railway line.""

The sites include Cavendish Solar Energy Center in Okeechobee County and two in St. Lucie County: Pink Trail Solar Energy Center

and Bluefield Preserve Solar Energy Center in St. Lucie County. The site in Okeechobee will provide power to the FPL Cavendish NextGen Hydrogen Hub which is expected to be completed at the end of this year FPL says and will be state's first-of-its-kind ""‘green hydrogen"" facility.

The other new sites are two in Calhoun County one in Clay County one in Escambia County one in Jackson County one in Miami-Dade County and one in Santa Roe County.

The 10 new centers are capable of generating 745 megawatts of quiet emissions-free energy which represents taking 140000 gasoline-dependent cars off the road each year according to FPL.

The electric company also expects six more solar energy centers to come online later this year.

In all FPL has 60 solar energy centers installed statewide to power electricity for 900000 homes. FPL has approximately 5.8 million accounts or more than 12 million people.

FPL’s solar power plant fleet is the largest in America and has saved customers about $375 million in fuel costs in 2022.

FPL says it hopes to eliminate carbon emissions from its power plant fleet by no later than 2045.

""This important milestone for FPL is the latest example of our unwavering commitment to America’s largest solar buildout on behalf of our customers and the Sunshine State” Tim Oliver vice president of FPL Development said in a news release. “We remain committed to making sustained long-term investments in solar energy – which uses no fuel to produce energy – to build a more resilient and more sustainable energy future our children and grandchildren can depend on.”

FPL is a subsidiary of Juno Beach-based NextEra Energy Inc.

Late last month FPL proposed another rate increase to offset the costs of two hurricanes last year. The proposal which was filed with Florida Public Service seeks to balance unrecovered fuel and storm costs from 2022 as well as a recent decline in projected fuel costs in 2023.

The cost recovery for Hurricane Ian and Hurricane Nicole would be spread over a 12-month period according to FPL.

Start of Spring (Chinese: 立春) the first solar term of the year begins this year on Feb 4 and ends on Feb 18.



Start of Spring lifts the curtain of spring. After that everything turns green and full of vigor; people clearly see that the daytime is becoming longer and the weather is becoming warmer.

Here are nine things you should know about Start of Spring.

Start of Spring and Spring Festival

As a solar term Start of Spring had already entered people's lives in the Spring and Autumn Period (770-476 BC). At that time there were eight solar terms. According to some experts the 24 solar terms were used for the first time in books during the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 24) when the Start of Spring was set as the Spring Festival. In 1913 the first day of the first month of the lunar year was mandated as the Spring Festival.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbWFyaXRpbWUtZXhlY3V0aXZlLmNvbS9lZGl0b3JpYWxzL2NoaW5hLWlzLXB1dHRpbmctbmV3LWVuZXJneS1hbmQtaW52ZXN0bWVudC1pbnRvLXRpZGFsLXBvd2Vy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China is Putting New Energy and Investment Into Tidal Power,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbWFyaXRpbWUtZXhlY3V0aXZlLmNvbS9lZGl0b3JpYWxzL2NoaW5hLWlzLXB1dHRpbmctbmV3LWVuZXJneS1hbmQtaW52ZXN0bWVudC1pbnRvLXRpZGFsLXBvd2Vy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025628FEEC50>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

CINCINNATI — In June of 2019 Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost thought a proposed utility bailout was a bad law but he didn’t publicly oppose it because of support he’d received from the bailout’s primary beneficiary FirstEnergy according to lobbyists’ text messages displayed in court on Friday.

Prosecutors displayed the messages as part of the racketeering trial of former House Speaker Larry Householder and Matt Borges a former Ohio Republican Party Chairman who was acting as a lobbyist at the time the utility bailout was debated and passed. They are accused in a scheme to use $61 million to make Householder speaker in 2019 so he could pass and protect a $1.3 billion bailout that mostly went to protect FirstEnergy’s failing nuclear and coal plants.

In another development Friday FBI Agent Blane Wetzel revealed the origin of the investigation and how Householder’s bad timing played into it.

At the time Householder and Borges were arrested in July 2020 federal prosecutors said it was likely the biggest bribery and money laundering scheme in Ohio history. Two months later as he announced a civil suit against FirstEnergy Yost echoed those sentiments.

“Corruption doesn’t happen on an industrial scale like this without cash” he said in a Sept. 23 2019 press conference. “And it’s incredibly important at this moment in our state’s history to send a message that the Ohio political system the Ohio law-making system the regulatory environment is not for sale. If you shut off the money spigot the corruption withers.”

But behind the scenes 15 months earlier — according to text messages between Borges and lobbyist Juan Cespedes — Yost was pulling his punches on the bailout. Borges said Yost was doing so partly because of $24000 he received from FirstEnergy and Borges in the cycle leading up to the 2018 election and the subsequent legislative session during which the bailout was passed.

Cespedes has pleaded guilty in the scandal and is expected to testify soon in the Householder trial.

After the scandal broke Yost announced that he would donate his FirstEnergy-related contributions to charity.

But according to Borges who had run earlier campaigns for Yost the FirstEnergy money spigot helped guide the attorney general’s conduct as the bailout was making its way through the legislature. Text messages indicate that Borges was assigned to try to enlist Yost’s help with the bailout.

The legislation House Bill 6 passed the Ohio House on May 29 2019 and by the time of the June 26 2019 text conversation between Borges and Cespedes opposition to the bailout was growing as it was being debated in the Senate.

One source of opposition was from outside groups that were planning a ballot initiative to repeal HB 6 if it passed. Borges and Cespedes discussed trying to make it exempt from repeal by treating it as a revenue bill and calling it a tax — based on a $1 subsidy built into the measure.

Cespedes asked Borges what the attorney general thought.

“He’s sympathetic but he wants to go back and look at the law” Borges replied.

As they discussed the matter further Borges said “Don’t repeat this” but Yost believed the bailout was a bad law.

Yost “‘would be out front (in opposition) if not for (FirstEnergy) support and your involvement’” Borges quoted Yost as saying.

As attorney general Yost also would have to approve any repeal language before it went on the ballot. The AG also wanted to help with that if he could Borges said.

“If there’s any way the law will allow him to reject the language he will do it” Borges texted.

Later in the day prosecutors played a recording of a phone message Yost left with Householder in which Yost discussed background checks related to petitions to get the repeal on the ballot. While it might be unusual for the attorney general to discuss such matters with an interested party Yost would eventually approve petitions and ballot language and allow the election to proceed.

After a bitter xenophobic and expensive fight the measure ultimately failed.

Yost has been subpoenaed in the case and his spokeswoman on Friday declined to comment on the text messages.

“He was subpoenaed to potentially be a witness in this case” the spokeswoman Bethany McCorkle said in an email. “At this time it is inappropriate for him to comment.”

In a separate development Wetzel the FBI agent explained how his investigation started. He’d been contacted by Rep. Dave Greenspan R-Westlake because Greenspan was concerned about the propriety of HB 6 which members had been subjected to great pressure to support.

Wetzel testified that he and Greenspan met at a Columbus Bob Evans restaurant to discuss the matter on May 28 2019 — the day before the initial version of the bailout was passed by the House. Wetzel didn’t describe what Greenspan’s claims were but during the meeting the lawmaker got a text from Speaker Householder.

The text asked Greenspan to delete all previous texts regarding House Bill 6 the agent said. That prompted Wetzel to take steps to obtain those communications.

Testimony resumes Monday in a trial that is expected to last into March.

Verona rallied at the end of regulation and went on to defeat Sun Prairie West 92-88 in overtime in a Big Eight Conference game then both teams left the court and took a hallway to go to their respective locker rooms.

“We are investigating an incident that occurred Tuesday night following a boys’ varsity basketball game between Sun Prairie West and Verona” Sun Prairie communications and engagement officer Patti Lux said in a statement Friday. “The incident involved some students parents and staff members after the game was over. Due to it being an active investigation we cannot provide any additional information at this time.”

Sun Prairie police Lt. Ryan Cox said Thursday officers responded to a call but there wasn’t a report immediately available. The matter was in the process of being investigated with police seeking to get statements and trying to obtain video of what occurred. A records request submitted to the police for the report was denied citing an active investigation.

Eric Nee athletics and activities director for the Sun Prairie Area School District said Thursday any requests for comment should be directed to Lux.

US retailer Bed Bath & Beyond which last week filed for bankruptcy protection has filed a claim of $37.65m against OOCL alleging exploitative and unjust business practices during the pandemic.

The retailer has filed its complaint with the FMC alongside increasing numbers of other angry shippers.

It’s not hard to see why from this initial set of complaints. As Bed Bath and Beyond (BB&B) noted despite contracted minimum quantity commitments of cargo to be shipped and corresponding vessel space OOCL “systematically failed” to meet the requirements and sold the space on to higher-paying customers leaving BB&B to find capacity on the much costlier spot market “at enormous expense”.

In fact it said only 70% of the required capacity in 2020 was provided and that “much of the freight actually moved … was moved only after [BB&B} agreed to [OOCL’s] demands for exorbitant premium pricing”. Between October 2021 and March 2022 OOCL provided just 52.9% of the contracted space.

BB&B also pointed out that many D&D charges were incurred because it was unable to pick up containers owing to congestion shipping line policies and numerous other problems including social distancing orders.

It also complained that surcharges such as for peak season should have been included in its pricing according to its contract – yet the retailer was still charged.

The filing includes a slew of emails from OOCL suggesting BB&B pay more and revealing: “OOCL did not attempt to conceal that it was actively auctioning space to the highest bidder rather than meeting its service commitment.”

One email from OOCL stated: “We are not looking to gouge but stating the reality of the current market environment for any extra space. Please advise if BBB[Y] would accept a $5800 per 40ft GP/HQ PSS on top of their primary contract pricing. This would position BBB[Y] at just around the $7000 mark.”

BB&B working through its bankruptcy added that OOCL’s container transport business made a 2021 operating profit of $7.36bn up 642% from the previous year. The retailer has been forced to launch a liquidation sale and said it would use its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings to find outside buyers that may be able to keep the business going or at least purchase some of its assets. It has been allowed to borrow $40m to stabilise its operations and begin a sales process.

In January BB&B reported its third-quarter results ending 26 November. It made a loss of $100m on net sales of $1.25bn.",,,,,,,,,,,,

President & CEO of Ford Motor Company Jim Farley said of the Blue Oval’s return to F1 “We decided to have a strategic and a technical partnership with Red Bull Powertrains to enter Formula One in 2026.""

Farley also mentioned that he is excited about F1’s ultimate goal of zero carbon emissions and green sustainability in the sport and that they are on that same mission at Ford which last raced in F1 in 2004.

Red Bull’s team principal Christian Horner emphasized that he was very excited about Ford's depth of knowledge and resource for this project. He felt there was a natural synergy between both companies and that it was an easy deal to make because the design was there by both sides.

Horner is looking forward to bringing the power unit in-house with Ford's support. This also includes supplying the Alpha Tauri team which is partnered with Red Bull.

The new engine rules for 2026 have now allowed both Audi and Ford to enter the sport as engine suppliers. For Ford's sake the new engine rules will shine a light on Ford's EVs or at least that's what they hope.

Ford's technical team will work with the newly built Red Bull powertrain department to build an engine for the 2026 season and beyond but with such an investment (around $100 million U.S.) the question has to be asked about what if any impact the return to F1 will have on any of Ford’s other motorsports investments.

The Dearborn Mich.-based company is involved in various racing series already and is a big name in all of them. That leads to a logical question: will Ford have to take a step back in these other sports to go fully 100% into the Formula One project?

Ford Motorsports is currently involved in NASCAR’s various series NHRA road racing rallycross Ford GT Racing offroad racing drifting and now Formula One.

Let's take a look at these current investments and talk about their future after the F1 news:

**********

NASCAR: In terms of racing in America Ford is best known for its NASCAR teams.

In terms of the Truck series Ford's only team is ThorSport a four-truck race team along with Zane Smith with Front Row Motorsports. Although ThorSport is considered a top team Ford could potentially pull out of its support of the Trucks although the cost savings that could then be applied to the F1 program would be maybe a few million dollars at best.

We saw this happen this year with Kyle Busch Motorsports switching from Toyota to Chevy – although to be fair a lot of that had to do with Busch leaving Toyota-powered Joe Gibbs Racing himself to race for Chevy-powered Richard Childress Racing. Exiting the truck series by losing their only full team may be the best option for cutting back in terms of NASCAR.

Then there’s the NASCAR Cup and Xfinity Series.

Ford has had a lot of success in both series. Joey Logano who drives for Team Penske a Ford team won the 2022 Cup championship.

Ford's development for NASCAR has also been at the cream of the crop including Team Penske Stewart Haas Racing and Front Row Motorsports. Young drivers such as Ryan Blaney and 2022 Daytona 500 winner (as a Cup rookie no less) Austin Cindric went through the Ford system on their way to the Cup Series.

Hailie Deegan and Zane Smith are the next Ford drivers to likely head to the Cup Series in the next year or two most likely.

With the amount of success Ford has had in these series and the drivers they currently have and are developing it’s unlikely Ford will decrease its investment in NASCAR. In fact word has it that Ford may be looking to expand its roster in 2024 to counter Toyota’s similar expansion plans.

**********

NHRA Drag Racing: Ford is decently involved in NHRA with five drivers on their three factory-sponsored teams. They have Bob Tasca III who has accumulated 11 Funny Car wins in his career and has really come into his own in the last few seasons.

Ford is invested in the drivers they currently have as well as their respective teams but let’s not forget one thing: they parted ways with 16-time Funny Car champ John Force several years ago so anything is possible.



If Ford were to pull out of NHRA the seven-figure monetary savings would likely go straight to F1. So if any series should be worried the most about Ford’s future with F1 it’s NHRA.

Sure drag racing is a niche sport that Ford has been involved in for a long time – and it doesn’t hurt to be involved when folks want to buy Ford-powered cars and trucks particularly like the Ford Mustang or F150.

But at the same time with the U.S. moving more toward an EV platform and Mustangs and F1s are already there could Ford quantify remaining in the fuel-powered world of drag racing – unless NHRA moves to an EV platform which appears unlikely in an overall picture.

Still drag racing and NHRA are both important to the Ford brand so while we may not see a complete pullout/exit of the Blue Oval a moderate-to-significant downsizing isn’t totally out of the question either.

**********

Sports Cars & GT Racing: In the sports car racing world Ford may be one of the best particularly the Ford Mustang.

At the end of 2022 the Mustang won an award for having the most pole positions in the Supercars Championship.

The Ford GT races at specific events like 24 Hours of Le Mans for example. Since these series are based on purpose-built race cars it is entirely possible Ford could give up on them and designate the cost savings to F1. these series.

At the same time it wouldn't make sense for Ford to ditch its sports car and road racing program as these cars are not used week in and week out and the races usually have high prize pools.

**********

Offroad/Rally/Drifting: Ford's drift teams have already been on the decline so a full exit would not be surprising.

Ford had a lot of success with Vaughn Gitten Jr. in the last few years along with the addition of YouTuber Adam LZ to the empire. But the investment in drifting lately has been minor and it would not be surprising to see a shuffling out process for Ford as it redirects its energies and dollars to F1 more so.

In terms of offroad and rally racing these are both smaller series that are important for Ford to be in. Having the Ford name in the sport may not help them sell cars as much as in other series like NASCAR and NHRA – although Truck sales can be directly correlated to offroad racing success -- but fans of the offroad and rally teams enjoy having Ford in their sport and are loyal consumers of their products.

Ford has been very successful in off-road especially in 2022 with the new Ford Bronco going undefeated in its class. Ford is constantly developing new cars for these series – like the Bronco – so an exit or decline in investment seems highly unlikely at this time.

**********

So what will Ford's future potentially look like in light of Friday’s news? If the F1 investment works out as planned and Ford wins championships and sells tons of EVs then there is a potential that Ford wouldn't have to cut off involvement in any other series as success in one series will likely extend to other series that carry the Blue Oval.

In fact although in the current economic climate it’s very hard to predict but if things go swimmingly from both a competitive and sales standpoint once Ford rejoins the F1 community the company could ultimately and potentially wind up investing even MORE in their overall motorsports program as a result.

There is no doubt that in the next three years leading up to the 2026 debut Ford will focus on the F1 project. The big question for them would be if they can put 100% into F1 and still keep their other series at a top level.

And what happens once Ford is back on-track in F1? What if it becomes an immediate or near-immediate success? Or worse what if it ultimately flops? How would either of those scenarios impact other forms of racing that carry the Blue Oval? Only time will tell.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2ZvcmQtdnMtZ20tdGFsZS10d28tYXV0b21ha2Vyc9IBRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2ZvcmQtdnMtZ20tdGFsZS10d28tYXV0b21ha2Vycy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ford vs. GM: A tale of two automakers,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2ZvcmQtdnMtZ20tdGFsZS10d28tYXV0b21ha2Vyc9IBRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveGJ1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9tYXJrZXRzL2ZvcmQtdnMtZ20tdGFsZS10d28tYXV0b21ha2Vycy5hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025625503220>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Early speculative reports gave differing accounts of what the nature of their relationship might be.

Would Ford would opt for the less expensive option of branding an engine developed by Red Bull? Or bear the heavier financial burden of contributing to the research and development of the complicated new power units for 2026?

Plus what would be the role of the Red Bull Powertrains division which was constructed by the team at its Milton Keynes base following the departure of its last manufacturer partner Honda at the end of 2021?

Friday’s announcement has shed more light on how the reigning world champion Formula 1 team and car-making giant will collaborate on a new power unit for 2026. Ford will not develop an entire 2026 F1 motor single-handedly but will “provide technical expertise in all areas where it can add value” the manufacturer said in a statement as the arrangement was made public yesterday.

Ford Performance Motorsport global director Mark Rushbrook explained more in a later briefing to media including RaceFans. The engine will be built to F1’s new power unit regulations for 2026 which will require the use of sustainable fuel and increase the power of the MGU-K while removing the MGU-H.

Red Bull has already started work on the new engine but there are still three years left during which Ford will contribute development effort before it races. Together they form one of the six manufacturers which have committed to the new engine regulations which will be in place at least from 2026 to 2030 and their power units will be used by both Red Bull and its junior team AlphaTauri.

“It is an eight-year agreement” Ford Performance Motorsport global director Mark Rushbrook explained. “We’ll co-develop together as Red Bull Ford Powertrains the new power unit across these three years. And we’ll obviously keep developing as we race in ’26 to 2030 with the Red Bull-Ford powering the Red Bull Racing cars and the AlphaTauri cars.”

Having teamed up with the reigning champions Ford are under no illusions that the engine they co-produce is expected to be a race-winning proposition from the start.

“In terms of the technical collaboration we’re full partners on that. So whatever we can do with Red Bull resources and Ford Motor Company [and] Ford Performance resources to get the maximum performance out of the new hybrid power unit we’ll take advantage of those resources to be fully competitive and capable of winning races and championships starting in ’26.”

The engine development will take place at Red Bull’s Powertrains facility alongside the team’s chassis production to maximise the efficiency of the integration between the two.

“There’s a great foundation in Milton Keynes with their Red Bull campus” says Rushbrook “there were already plans underway to have a building for Powertrains there with the dynos to house the team to build the power units. And that is still the plan to have that as the cornerstone of the power unit program.

“It’s important to be embedded there with the racing team and the racing car so that you can optimise the total package as it goes onto the track.”

Ford staff will work directly on power unit development though this will not begin immediately. “There certainly will be Ford Performance employees that are part of the team” said Rushbrook. “We have already a global team with people in the United States and people in the UK and in Europe that work on our global motorsports programmes. And that team is is growing and will be part of this program as well.

“Certainly I expect that we will have employees located full-time in Milton Keynes but not yet at this point. We’re still working through exactly who and when and how but definitely some strong areas there where we’re committed to work together.”

The contribution from the substantial resources of Ford will be focused on the electrical side of the power unit. “Everything’s on the table in terms of resources from Ford Motor Company to contribute to this where it’s going to add value and benefit” Rushbrook explains.

“The initial areas that have been identified where we’re working are certainly in the battery cell technology in the electric motor itself the controls software both in the fundamental software as well as the calibration of that to optimise the performance analytics within the power unit itself.”

The collaboration between the two won’t be one-way and won’t stop at the engine. Ford also aims to learn from Red Bull’s aerodynamics expertise which has underpinned so much of its success. “We’re also hoping to learn more about aerodynamics to bring that back to our road car some of the processes and tools that they have” said Rushbrook.

But the engine remains the heart of the operation and it will be fascinating to learn in three years’ time how the Red Bull-Ford measures up against Mercedes Ferrari and the rest.

Kevin Harvick doesn't just have his retirement announcement out of the way he also has his post-retirement plan out there for everyone to see.

Harvick will join Mike Joy and Clint Bowyer in the FOX Sports broadcast booth for NASCAR Cup Series races in 2024.

The 47-year-old Harvick winner of 60 Cup races and the 2014 Cup title has already worked more than 25 Xfinity races and three truck races from the booth. Harvick has shown the ability to dissect and explain quickly the whys of what happened on the racetrack.

""I have done a lot a lot of things in the booth and knew that was somewhere that I wanted to be because I like talking about the sport"" Harvick said. ""I like to be able to tell stories and be a part of the broadcast and that's something that I have enjoyed.

""I enjoyed the preparation and everything that goes into it to be able to tell a story.""

Harvick made it a priority to have all his plans set going into his final Cup season so he can focus on his final 38 races as a Cup driver. The California native has never known anything but the spotlight as he replaced Dale Earnhardt after Earnhardt's death in the 2001 Daytona 500. Over the last 22 years he has competed in 790 Cup races with 430 top-10 finishes.

""This is a marriage eight years in the making — since he first stepped into our NASCAR Xfinity Series booth with more presence and poise than most newcomers dream of"" said Brad Zager FOX Sports executive producer and president of productions and operations.

The Stewart-Haas Racing driver finished 15th in the standings last year with two victories. He was eliminated from the playoffs in the opening round.

His career has spanned a variety of playoff formats four generations of Cup cars and included owning his own Xfinity and truck teams.

""There's really nobody else who has stepped out of the car and into the booth with the new car"" Harvick said. ""There's a lot of new things happening with this particular car that are much different than the way that the other car raced the way the other car felt.""

'The car did not play a factor' Kevin Harvick opened up about speculation that the Next Gen car was the reason for him retiring.

Harvick said with all of his Kevin Harvick Inc.'s business interests — among its portfolio it represents drivers (including his son Keelan) and other athletes brokers sponsorships is a partner in a short-track late model series — he felt he couldn't retire and not come to the race track. Keelan is 10 years old; daughter Piper is 5.

""I knew that there was no way that I was going to sit around and not do anything"" Harvick said. ""That was just impossible. ... There's just too many things that pointed to don't leave the racetrack you still have to stay involved. And for me this was a great way to be able to stay busy [and] do something that I enjoy.""

He also knows Bowyer well as a teammate with him at Richard Childress Racing and SHR. But Harvick said he hopes to be able to let his guard down a little bit around other drivers because he will no longer view them as competitors.

""Clint and I have been good friends through the years but it's always been balanced with that competitive mindset that each of us has to try to go out and do the best that you can"" Harvick said.

""And that's a much different mindset than we'll be in going forward. ... I've always been pretty guarded about the things that I say who I'm friends with and how close you get to people.""

Harvick has been known to be opinionated and he went scorched earth on NASCAR last year over the safety issues and what he saw as a slow response.

""I would tell you that that relationship is as good as it's ever been just because of everything that we've all gone through over the past over the past year"" Harvick said.

""Being able to have that communication and those relationships and carry those forward to be able to help grow the sport and help have ideas and do it for the right reasons is something that I think it's very important. The bad moments often times make relationships stronger than the easy good moments because they force you to have conversations that you would otherwise not have.""

NASCAR celebrates milestone 75th year The NASCAR Race Hub crew looks back at the most memorable moments in NASCAR history.

The decision to join FOX which currently airs the first half of the NASCAR Cup Series season likely will keep Harvick from doing anything immediately with a race team despite having heard from teams looking for his leadership (and potential investment). While he said he is open to talks with teams about potential leadership and consulting roles he doesn't anticipate anything materializing prior to 2024.

He said his son's racing has taken more time than anticipated and he knows the television work will also take a significant amount of time.

""The team participation piece of it would be something that would be down the road"" Harvick said. ""I just right now want to fully understand what I have on my plate.

""I don't want to get in a position to where I've committed to too many things. ... Really for the first six months of 2024 until I step out of booth at the at the last race commitment I don't really think that there's much else that I can put on my plate.""

Harvick believes a commitment to broadcasting is a commitment to growing the sport. He will be in the Xfinity booth for four races and the truck booth for three races this year as well as make numerous appearances on NASCAR Race Hub.

""I loved John Madden just because of the fact that when you look at him he had such a huge impact on the sport and could do that through the booth but always carried through with those relationships that he had out of the booth and with the people in the league and reach so much further than just sitting in the booth"" Harvick said.

""I care about the sport.""

Night Shyamalan Almost Directed Life of Pi,"From his early success with “The Sixth Sense” and “Unbreakable” to his mid-2000s dry spell that included “After Earth” and “The Last Airbender” M. Night Shyamalan‘s roller coaster of a career has taken him through every level of Hollywood. The multi-hyphenate has found renewed success in recent years directing mid-budget genre films like “Old” and “Knock at the Cabin” but that doesn’t mean he’s stopped thinking about some of the bigger projects that he flirted with over the years. In a new interview with The Hollywood Reporter Shyamalan reflected on some of the projects that he came close to directing over the course of his three decade career.

“I loved the book ‘Life of Pi’ and I was going to make it. But Ang Lee made a beautiful movie from it. That was one that I wished I did” Shyamalan said. “In between the first two movies I wrote a spec screenplay called ‘Labor of Love’ and it became a giant bidding war in Hollywood. Fox then bought it and they fired me as a director because I was a kid. I almost made it many many times since but at this point I probably won’t ever make it.”

But while every filmmaker has a few lost projects they wish had materialized Shyamalan isn’t too upset about missing out on those two films. The director explained that he’s happy to have found a creative home at Universal where he can continue to develop original projects an opportunity that is afforded to increasingly few filmmakers.

“They’ve been very good at letting us do our thing and they’re just very kind people” he said of Universal. “They have not shied away from the original movie which has been to their great benefit. I wish the whole industry would embrace the original movie and bring it back. Once upon a time the entire industry was geared solely toward original movies. Finding and supporting new voices that can reach large audiences used to be the major thing and Universal has now made that a mandate.”

“Knock at the Cabin” is now playing in theaters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveG5ld3MuY29tL3BvbGl0aWNzL2NoaW5lc2Utc3B5LWJhbGxvb24tcmFpc2VzLWFsYXJtLWJlbGxzLWNoaW5hLWJ1eWluZy11cy1sYW5k0gFgaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94bmV3cy5jb20vcG9saXRpY3MvY2hpbmVzZS1zcHktYmFsbG9vbi1yYWlzZXMtYWxhcm0tYmVsbHMtY2hpbmEtYnV5aW5nLXVzLWxhbmQuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chinese spy balloon raises alarm bells over China buying up US land,"A Chinese balloon craft floating over the northern United States has re-energized concerns among experts and lawmakers over China's ongoing efforts to buy land across the U.S. with some voices observing a ""pattern"" of suspected espionage activities near American military sites.

China on Friday confirmed the balloon is Chinese claiming it's a civilian research craft that was blown far off course by prevailing winds. However Pentagon spokesperson Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder described the craft during briefings on Thursday and Friday as a high-altitude surveillance balloon.

""Instances of this kind of balloon activity have been observed previously over the past several years"" said Ryder. ""Once the balloon was detected the U.S. government acted immediately to protect against the collection of sensitive information.""

The suspected spy balloon was spotted over Montana home to one of the nation's three nuclear missile silo fields at Malmstrom Air Force Base.

CHINESE SPY BALLOON OVER CENTRAL US WILL BE IN US AIRSPACE FOR 'A FEW DAYS' PENTAGON SAYS

U.S. officials have previously warned about Chinese companies such as the telecommunications giant Huawei purchasing land near critical infrastructure in Montana and potentially capturing sensitive information regarding intercontinental ballistic missiles under the direction of the 341st Missile Wing at Malmstrom Air Base.

""Set against that destructive power is a completely serene and wide-open landscape. It's just wheat fields and big sky country"" FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr said in 2021 while describing a trip to the base two years earlier. ""Except for one thing: There are cell towers all around those Montana missile fields that have been running on Huawei equipment.""

The Chinese surveillance balloon has prompted Montana lawmakers to push for a ban on Chinese agricultural land purchases in the state.

""This really shows that there are nations out there that want to spy on us. Senate Bill 203 prevents those adversarial nations from purchasing our ag production land and our critical infrastructure"" Montana state Sen. Ken Bogner told local outlet KTQV. ""The Ag production land hits issues of food security — we help feed the entire nation. And the critical infrastructure is things like oil refineries telecommunication facilities. So it's a plethora of things to make sure that we're protected as much as we can be here in the state.""

More broadly experts told Fox News Digital that the balloon is indicative of a larger Chinese espionage effort.

CHINA EXPERT SOUNDS ALARM ON SPY BALLOON HOVERING OVER US: 'IT’S VERY DANGEROUS WHAT THEY’RE DOING'

""China has stepped up its espionage activities against sensitive military facilities"" said Gordan Chang author of ""The Coming Collapse of China and The Great U.S.-China Tech War."" ""This is clearly part of a pattern.""

Last summer the Chinese company Fufeng Group a food manufacturer made headlines for purchasing 370 acres of land in Grand Forks N.D. some 15 miles away from Grand Forks Air Force a center for both air and space operations.

The Air Force this week denied Fufeng Group its building permits for a wet corn milling plant on the land calling the project a ""significant threat to national security.""

In Texas meanwhile a Chinese company owned by a former Chinese soldier with ties to the ruling Communist Party bought 130000 acres near Laughlin Air Force Base where pilots are trained.

Texas Republicans and Gov. Greg Abbott are seeking to ban Chinese citizens and businesses from buying property in the Lone Star State.

STEFANIK ROUNDS LEAD BIPARTISAN BILL TO PREVENT CHINA FOREIGN ADVERSARIES FROM BUYING INTO US AGRICULTURE

Florida and Virginia are among other states where leaders have been backed similar bans.

""Whether this is actually part of plan or not these purchases are suspiciously close to sensitive military facilities and therefore shouldn't be allowed"" said Chang.

He argued that until the U.S. gets a hold of these suspicious activities on agricultural land the U.S. needs to institute a prohibition on Chinese land purchases.

""No Chinese entity should own farm or ranch land in U.S. full stop including land involved in food processing"" said Chang. ""Chinese parties that own this land should either have it expropriated with compensation or if there was criminal activity forfeiture statues should be used to take it away.""

Beyond the states lawmakers at the federal level have also been pushing to crack down on Chinese entities buying U.S. land.

AFTER CHINESE BALLOON ENTERS US AIRSPACE BIDEN SECRETARY OF STATE POSTPONES TRIP TO CHINA

In the Senate Sens. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.) introduced legislation that would blacklist China and other ""foreign adversaries"" from investing in purchasing or otherwise acquiring land or businesses involved in agriculture.

In the House Reps. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.) and Dan Newhouse (D-Wash.) introduced similar legislation to block China from purchasing American farmland.

""As more reports come in it is becoming apparent the Chinese Communist Party is deliberately testing how the United States will respond to their provocative actions"" Newhouse told Fox News Digital. ""This is yet another example of their alarming aggression. President Biden must act swiftly to confront this situation.""

""As a member of the House Select Committee on China"" he continued ""I am eager to further investigate the aggressive actions of the CCP and seek avenues to hold them accountable.""

Rodgers' office echoed those sentiments and the need to remain vigilant.

""The situation unfolding is worrisome. The congresswoman believes that under no circumstances should an aircraft operated by the Chinese government be flying in American airspace conducting surveillance"" said Rodgers spokesman Kyle VonEnde. ""She continues to monitor the situation closely and is grateful to the servicemen and women of Fairchild Air Force Base whose swift response once again demonstrates just how vital their strategic mission is to keeping our skies safe from adversaries in the Pacific arena.""

Both bills were introduced this week not long before the Chinese surveillance balloon became public.

Several prominent Republicans called for President Biden to shoot down the Chinese balloon while others demanded an intelligence briefing. Biden declined to shoot down the Chinese spy balloon but Secretary of State Antony Blinken postponed a trip to China following the controversy over the balloon

The Pentagon said Friday the craft doesn't pose a military or physical threat to people on the ground but continues to track its movement."

I want to achieve greater returns in 2023 after what was a challenging 2022 for many investors. With the UK economy likely to enter a recession this year it might pay me to increase my exposure to fast-growing economies elsewhere in the world.

India’s economy is forecast grow at 6.1% in 2023 — the year in which it will become the world’s most populous nation. So let’s take a closer look at India’s growth and how I could increase my exposure to this fast-growing state.

Growth with headwinds

India has more people within working-age groups than any other population group. This traditionally leads to something called a demographic dividend — a period of accelerated growth due to a low dependency ratio.

Demographic data suggests that India could have a golden period between 2020 to 2040. However we shouldn’t take India’s growth for granted. The nation needs a healthy educated skilled and economically active population.

And this is where some challenges may lie. Only a very small percentage (10%) of the labour force are employed in the formal economy and education particularly among women isn’t geared towards employable skills. Furthermore there are widespread health issues including malnutrition and anaemia.

Despite this Indian economic growth will likely exceed global averages in the coming years.

Should I be wary?

Investing in a developing nation does carry more risks than investing in the UK even from the perspective of currency fluctuations.

This week Asia’s now-former richest man Gautam Adani was accused of pulling “the largest con in corporate history“. His flagship company Adani Enterprise tanked. Adani’s market losses topped $100bn.

Adani’s empire is tied closely with many aspects of India’s economy. Will it have an impact on economic growth? It’s unlikely. But it is concerning that Adani’s mismanagement was allowed to happen. “Adani may have started a confidence crisis in Indian shares and that could have broader market implications” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya senior market analyst at Swissquote Bank.

So it can pay to be wary.

Increasing my exposure to India

Despite the challenges this week I’m still keen to increase my exposure to India but only slightly. One of the best ways to do this through funds or trusts as there isn’t a wealth of Indian stocks listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).

I already own shares in Jupiter India and Stewart Inv Indian Subcontinent Sustainability. To date they haven’t provided me with great returns. That’s partially because both of them dipped this week as Adani’s empire tanked.

But naturally there are other options. One that I’m looking to buy is the JPMorgan Indian Investment Trust. It’s the biggest Indian investment trust on the LSE by market cap as such it the first point of call for many retail investors looking for greater exposure to India. However its performance has been fairly disappointing.

There are other smaller trusts too including Aberdeen New India Investment Trust and Ashoka India Equity Investment Trust. I’m also keeping a close eye on Franklin Templeton FTSE India which looks to track the performance of the Indian index.

There’s no guarantee that these trusts will provide me with big returns but given India’s economic forecast I’m keen to increase my exposure to the fast-growing nation.",,,,,,

(WMC/Gray News) - Authorities in Tennessee say officers were able to contact a teen who was possibly contemplating suicide.

According to the Memphis Police Department officers responded to a call regarding a person on the edge of a bridge on Interstate 40 Thursday.

Arriving officers said they located the person standing on the outside ledge of the bridge.

Memphis police said Officer Shaw began to talk with the person and found out he was 17 years old who recently became a father.

Police said he told Officer Shaw about how he was stressed about being a new father and about how life is stressful.

Authorities said Officer Shaw being a mother herself talked with the 17-year-old and shared with him how she understood his stress.

Officer Shaw reportedly spoke to the teen for nearly 15 minutes and convinced him to hold on to her while helping him to safety.

After he was pulled from the ledge the two hugged police said.

According to the department Officer Shaw told him that “Things will get better.”

In a matter of days this week at least four disparate efforts to shore up supply chain security were declared an example of how front-of-mind such risks have become and a push from vendors and developers to reduce them.

The threat is growing. Gartner expects that by 2025 45 percent of organizations globally will have experienced a software supply chain attack a three-fold jump from 2021. It's not a surprise according to Neatsun Ziv CEO of startup Ox Security that's building an open MITRE ATT&CK-like framework for enterprises to check software supply chains.

""These kinds of attacks become super super lucrative just because the [hits] that you could get from a single weapon is not proportional to anything else you see in the industry"" Ziv told The Register.

As with the SolarWinds attack a miscreant can inject malicious code into a piece of software before the compromised software is sent out to customers and compromises those systems. Organizations seem to be slow in catching up to this.

More recently attackers have targeted code repositories like GitHub and PyPI and companies like CI/CD platform provider CircleCI an incident that expanded the definition of a supply chain attack according to Matt Rose field CISO for cybersecurity vendor ReversingLabs.

""What the CircleCI incident illustrates is that organizations have to not only be concerned about malware being injected into a compiled object or deliverable but also of the tooling used to build them"" Rose wrote in a blog post. ""That's why the CircleCI hack is an eye opener to a lot of organizations out there.""

One framework for them all

The OSC&R (Open Software Supply Chain Attack Reference) was launched this week founded by Ziv – former vice president of cybersecurity at Check Point – and other security pros with background at such places as Google Microsoft GitLab and Fortinet.

The idea is to give enterprises a common framework for evaluating and measuring the risk to their supply chains something that has traditionally been done with intuition and experience. OSC&R will give organizations a common language and tools for understanding the attack tactics and defenses prioritize threats and track threat group behavior.

It will be updated as new tactics crop up will help with red-team penetration exercises and will take contributions from other vendors. The group took concepts for ransomware and endpoints used in MITRE ATT&CK and applied them to the supply chain.

""The challenge was that there was no framework to get us from a basic understanding to our ability to check our environment if we are susceptible to the supply chain attacks"" Ziv said.

The framework touches on nine key areas – such as container and open-source security secrets hygiene and CI/CD posture – and outlines the techniques used by attackers in such areas as initial access persistence privilege escalation and defense evasion. It will grow in both features and contributors he said.

The OpenVEX spec

In the same spirit supply chain security vendor Chainguard is heading up a group that includes HPE VMware and The Linux Foundation to jumpstart the adoption of the Visibility Exploitability eXchange (VEX) a tool for addressing vulnerabilities in enterprise software. It's supported by agencies like the US National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) and Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA).

Enter the OpenVEX specification and reference toolchain

""Up until today VEX has been a concept the industry has invested time debating and building minimum requirements around"" Chainguard founder and CEO Dan Lorenc wrote. ""With the release of OpenVEX organizations can now put VEX into practice.""

OpenVEX will work as a companion to software bill of materials which help with transparency but can create ""noise"" in the industry Lorenc wrote. With OpenVEX suppliers can more precisely describe how exploitable the products are and help end users filter out false positives.

Chainguard has put OpenVEX in some of its products including its Wolfi container-specific Linux distribution and Images secure-by-default container base images.

For its part cybersecurity vendor Checkmarx is building onto the supply chain security offering it released in March 2022 with a threat intelligence tool to focuses on the supply chain. It includes information such as identifying malicious packages by the type of attack – like typosquatting or dependency confusion -- analysis of the operators behind the attack how the packages operate and the historical data behind them.

""This intel is all about tracking purpose-built malicious packages that often contain ransomware cryptomining code remote code execution and other common types of malware"" wrote Stephen Gates principal content marketing manager for Checkmarx.

CISA on the move

CISA reportedly is creating an office to address supply chain security and work with the public and private sectors to put federal policies in place. According to a report in the Federal News Network Shon Lyublanovits is leading the initiative. She heads the project management office for cyber supply chain risk management (C-SCRM) which is part of CISA's cybersecurity division.

The issues the office will address range from counterfeit components to open-source software vulnerabilities.

It's the latest step for CISA which has had a focus on supply chain security since creating a task force for IT and communications technology task for in 2018.

Varun Badhwar co-founder and CEO at supply chain security vendor Endor Labs applauded CISA's decision to create the office telling The Register that establishing ""a new capability at such a high level stands out as a milestone.""

However it's important to understand the complexities of the problem Badhwar said. There are open-source components through the software lifecycle and organizations need to first secure the open-source software they use. Enterprises and agencies use an average of more than 40000 open-source software packages downloaded by developers and each of those can bring in another 77 dependencies.

""This causes a massive ungoverned sprawl that increases the supply chain attack surface across multiple dimensions"" he said adding that Endor Labs has found that 95 percent of open source vulnerabilities are found in the transitive dependencies. ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vZTN6aW5lLmNvbS9wYXBlcmxlc3MtdHVyYnVsZW50LWh5YnJpZC1idXQtc3VjY2Vzc2Z1bC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paperless Turbulent Hybrid but Successful,"The year 2023 will be a successful one but only for those who remain agile and hybrid. Radical concepts have had their day: ""only"" and ""first"" are relics of the past. The future appears to be hybrid as we will be experiencing a generational paradigm shift until 2030.

One of the largest and most global-reaching internet companies invested a considerable sum of money into paper in Germany in recent years. That company is Google and they financed a printed supplement in Manager Magazin several times demonstrating what holistic communication for the C-level company can look like.

Information transfer knowledge transfer and education continue to operate in the birthplace of Gutenberg the inventor of modern letterpress printing with movable metal type and the printing press. While a U.S. corporation in Germany is investing sustainably in paper as an offline medium a U.S. publisher will withdraw completely from paper production at the beginning of 2023: The Munich-based publishing house IDG International Data Group founded in Massachusetts and known for its legendary German publication Computerwoche (Computer week) magazine. The magazine was once the bible of the German-language IT scene with the unforgettable editor-in-chief Dieter Eckbauer and his alter ego “Sebastian Trauerwein Information Resources Manager”; however it now plans to discontinue all paper-based products.

Is paperless an option? Perhaps. The fact is that tablets have not established themselves as magazine killers. The responsive design of modern websites appears to be better competition. In spite of this our German E-3 printed magazine showed sustained success during the pandemic because paper was a relaxing alternative to Zoom and Microsoft Teams.

Even if the German-speaking User Association DSAG were to also halt its printed magazine production in the future citing environmental consciousness as their reason we at E3 traveled to the DSAG Annual Congress 2022 in Leipzig by train and not by plane! That is to say there are other ways to be environmentally conscious.

The SAP community is experiencing a generational paradigm shift. This shift will take place over the coming years and it will be turbulent hybrid and for some members of the SAP community very successful. A text published on this subject by the research and advisory firm Gartner is worth noting. According to Gartner in order to drive sustainable growth in turbulent and uncertain economic times CIOs and IT leaders should leverage digital investments that deliver financial and performance results in an efficient and responsible manner. This is what Gartner calls IT for sustainable growth.

During opening remarks at this year’s Gartner IT Symposium Gartner analysts said CIOs can leverage IT for sustainable growth by focusing on three strategies: revolutionizing work responsible investment and robust cybersecurity. CIOs and IT leaders should revolutionize work by technologically empowering the workforce to deliver sustainable performance.

All that remains is to add: do good things and talk about them. Gartner’s recommended steps should also be made known within the SAP community. The online e3zine platform is available for exactly this purpose."

The Subang Airport Regeneration Plan announced by Malaysia transport minister Anthony Loke on 6 February focuses on three areas: a “complete aerospace ecosystem” general and business aviation operations as well as building a city airport with regional commercial flight operations.

At present Subang airport handles turboprop operations from Malaysia Airlines associate Firefly as well as Lion Air-linked operator Batik Air Malaysia. Both carriers operate ATR 72s from Subang with Firefly utilising the type on international flights to Singapore.

The airport was the main gateway into Malaysia before the present Kuala Lumpur international airport (KLIA) – located further south of Kuala Lumpur in the town of Sepang – opened in 1998.

Loke says the plan envisages the introduction of narrowbody aircraft operations from Subang. These will include passenger and cargo operations the minister adds to allow the airport to target the premium and business traveller segment given that it is located nearer to the city than KLIA.

Loke adds that existing turboprop operations will remain at Subang “as market demand for such services…is projected to be healthy and positive”.

When redevelopment works are complete Subang airport is expected to be able to handle up to 8 million passengers a year a significant uptick from present passenger numbers.

The minister also downplays any concern that the new airport will impact existing operations at KLIA noting that the services “will be complemented” and allow KLIA to handle longer range flights.

“In addition this will give supply chain in the aerospace industry and air transport a strong boost in line with the government’s aspiration to make the leader in aerospace industry in Southeast Asia by 2030” says Loke.

Subang is a growing aerospace hub that is home to major players spanning the supply chain such as Airbus Helicopters and GE Aviation.",,,,,,,,,

That is until I discovered the goodness of Focus mode. I am now a lot more disciplined with my iPad during work hours. Focus mode is essentially a Do Not Disturb mode but with a whole bag of neat customizations and filters tagging along.

Focus starts from the first screen you see right after you unlock your iPad. Apple offers Focus presets like sleep and work by default but you can create your own custom focus easily for scenarios like gaming workout and more.

When you create a Focus you will get an option to set up your own home screen with only the apps that you need for those hours. This way you don’t see any other apps and get distracted when you unlock the iPad in scheduled hours.

Aside from customizing your Focus schedule based on a specific time window you can also set it to activate based on location or app activity. For example a custom Focus mode for gaming only activates when you reach your home. Alternatively the work Focus only goes live when you open an app like Slack letting your iPad know that it’s time to work.

Based on your Focus preference you can choose to allow notifications from only a select bunch of your contacts or apps. Plus you can further tweak things to your liking with Filters for apps and system-level settings.

For example you can choose to get notified from only a certain shared calendar get message notifications from a select contact group and even pick between light and dark modes for each Focus profile.

Apple goes a step further to give you those moments of zen by cross-device syncing. When you enable a certain Focus — like a sleep Focus on your iPad — it automatically applies across all your linked devices such as iPhone Mac and the Apple Watch.

Focus is one of the most underrated productivity tools on Apple devices but with proper customization it can really elevate your computing experience.

Deploy it as a companion screen

I work from my iPad quite often and there have been a few instances where I’ve been asked if it’s enough to get work done. The answer is both “yes” and “no” depending on the complexity of the tasks at hand. But I’ve come to realize that despite all of iPadOS’s shortcomings the iPad is a great companion screen for your Mac.

The features that enable this secondary screen convenience for the iPad are Handoff and Continuity. The best part? You don’t actually have to play with any deep settings to enable them.

Now one of the best Continuity perks is Sidecar which lets you set an iPad as a secondary screen for your Mac in landscape orientation. You just have to enable the Screen Mirroring option from Control Center and you’re good to go.

You get all your core macOS modifier controls like Command Option and Shift among others neatly arranged in a vertical bar on the side of your iPad’s screen. You also get access to your Mac’s dock and support for gestures such as a three-finger pinch for copy-paste and a three-finger swipe for undo/redo actions.

Apple even serves a Touch Bar on iPad with Sidecar even if your Mac doesn’t offer that convenience. Of course you can still use the Apple Pencil on your iPad even with Sidecar enabled.

Talking about accessories here Universal Control ensures that you can use the same keyboard and mouse connected to your Mac for controlling your iPad as well. Dragging windows across both screens is a breeze.

But the best part is that Sidecar’s screen mirroring session lives like an app on your iPad which means you can swipe up from the bottom dock on your iPad use an iPadOS app and then get back to the macOS view appearing in the Continuuity card.

When I am not mirroring the screen and need interrupted access to my iPad’s app I can still use my Mac’s keyboard and trackpad to control my iPad complete with multi-finger gesture support.

Even without screen mirroring I can get away from my iPad and continue where I left off on my Mac while using in-house apps like Notes and Safari. It’s one of those irresistible Apple ecosystem features that pushes you toward remaining loyal to the brand all because cross-device collaboration is so seamless.

Collaboration is a terrific system

iPadOS 16 supercharged a system called Collaboration that added a whole new universe of real-time teamwork possibilities for Apple’s own apps. Soon the convenience will start popping up for third-party apps as well.

All you need to do is tap on the Share icon while using in-house apps like Safari Note or Freeform and you will find your usual means of communication — like iMessage and FaceTime — ready to send a collaboration invite.

You no longer have to send copies of a project or go through the hassle of making web links and then using another app to share it with your contacts. Collaboration invites are created and shared directly within the app and so is the ability to grant viewing and editing privileges.

Apple even shows a cool preview of Collaboration invites right in iMessage and once the invited person starts working you will get notified. The app even lets you see all the changes via colorful highlights which is neat.

I had my colleague Prakhar terribly singing me a song in a small FaceTime window while we were working together remotely on an assignment in Apple’s Freeform app. The whole collaboration system is great and a glimpse of ever greater things to come for the iPad and its operating system.

Quick Note is incredibly convenient

Previous Next 1 of 3 Nadeem Sarwar/Digital Trends Nadeem Sarwar/Digital Trends Nadeem Sarwar/Digital Trends

Note-taking is a chore but iPadOS 15 introduced a new feature called Quick Note that turns the hassle into a breeze. Just swipe up from the bottom right corner of the screen and a small floating window of the Note app pops up. If you’re using Apple’s Magic Keyboard a Globe + Q key combo also gets the job done.

Whatever you type draw or paste here will be added to a dedicated Quick Note category in the Note app. But there are a few convenient tricks hidden in the Quick Note system. First it has its very own screengrab tool that automatically takes a screenshot and does the pasting job.

Second if you are browsing a webpage on Safari and add some element from it to a Quick Note the activity is logged. The next time you visit that webpage a small preview of the Quick Note will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen showing what you copied from that particular page when you originally visited it.

The Quick Note feature can be launched in any app and it can also be hidden with the same slide-over gesture as regular apps in multitasking mode. You can also use the tagging system in the app to find the desired documents quickly if you happen to be a prolific note-taker.

Touch gestures blended with shortcuts

iPadOS isn’t as gesture-intuitive as Android  but there are still a handful of gestures that make life easier. If an iPad is connected to your Mac via the Universal Control system a majority of your macOS trackpad gestures will also work on the iPad lying nearby.

However iPadOS has its own share of touch-based that is quite a rewarding experience in the first place. But first you need to enable them by following this path: Settings > General > Gestures.

Once you’ve enabled the multi-finger and corner gestures you can just swipe your way through core iPadOS controls. For example an inward swipe from the left corner instantly captures a screenshot and presents the editing tools while an inward swipe from the bottom right corner brings up Quick Notes.

Instead of playing with the dock bar at the bottom you can swipe sideways anywhere on the screen with four fingers to switch between apps. Pinch inwards with all five fingers to minimize the current app and land on the app screen. Pinch outward and you will arrive at the multitasking view with all the active apps appearing in the card preview format.

While running an app if you pull up the dock and drag an app out of it it will automatically open in split view. Also if you notice iPadOS now shows a three-dot icon at the top that lets you quickly switch between full or split-screen view for each app or push it to the slide-over for multi-tasking.

You can also create app pairs with a simple drag-and-drop gesture by dragging on the app’s preview card over another one in the preview view. But do keep in mind that not all apps support this functionality especially games and video-watching programs.

Then there are keyboard shortcuts especially with the Magic keyboard that really help speed things up. If you are using a third-party keyboard you can arrange the key modifiers by following this path: Settings > General > Keyboard > Hardware Keyboard > Modifier Keys.

In the meantime here are my favorites:

Globe (press and hold) View basic iPadOS shortcuts Globe + S Open Siri Command (press and hold) View shortcuts while running an app Globe + C Open Control Center Globe + H Jump to Home Screen Globe + N Open the notifications shade Globe + A Show the app dock Globe + Up Arrow Pull up the app switcher Globe + Shift + A Show the app library Globe + Down Arrow Pull up the multitasking view Globe + Q Open Quick Note window Globe + Control + Right Arrow Tile window to split view on right

Window management on iPadOS is still not as good as Samsung’s OneUI spin on Android . However Apple is slowly getting there. There is still plenty that Apple needs to fix but if you’re a part of Apple’s ecosystem the iPad’s computing prowess has plenty to offer if pushed the right way.

From dancers to great music the parade honored Asian culture and showed off their many traditions also celebrating the Lunar New Year.

Agnes Chau is president of Youth Enrichment and Senior Services (YESS) and helped organize the parade alongside Mills 50 and other organizations.

“With this year of the rabbit we’re going to set it out with prosperity health good fortune” Chau said. “We’re Asian Americans but we always want to be part of the community the bigger community including our culture.”

For Simon Choy the vice president and general manager of payroll company ADP the annual parade is personal for him. He was born and raised in Malaysia and said it means so much to see his culture celebrated and honored right here in Central Florida.

“This is very meaningful for me” Choy said. “We (ADP) are also the title sponsor. We just want to be part of this community and just giving back.”

Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer and other local elected leaders took part in Sunday’s celebrations including Orlando City Commissioner Patty Sheehan who covers part of the district where the parade happened.

“It’s so important now more than ever to realize that we are better together. We are stronger when we unite” Sheehan said. “It says that we are welcoming inclusive and decent people.”

The contaminated Kellogg’s Honey Smacks breakfast cereal caused 135 confirmed illnesses in 36 states.

According to a news release from the US Department of Justice (DOJ) the company has agreed to pay a criminal fine and forfeiture amount totaling $19228000.

The plea agreement has not yet been accepted by the court.

According to the DOJ’s news release if the agreement is accepted “…the $19.228 million fine and forfeiture will constitute the largest-ever criminal penalty following a criminal conviction in a food safety case.”

The company shut down operations at its Gridley Illinois facility in December 2018 due to a drop in demand for the products manufactured at that location.

In October 2022 Ravi Kumar Chermala Kerry’s former Quality Assurance Director pled guilty to three misdemeanor counts of introducing adulterated food into Interstate Commerce.

Kerry Inc. released a statement on February 3 2023 in which the company regretted “…the unacceptable practices and failures that occurred at Gridley.”

On the Q-T

The FDA’s investigation into this Salmonella outbreak–and the subsequent actions taken against the manufacturer–have been surrounded by a veil of silence from the beginning.

Honey Smacks cereal was manufactured by Kerry Inc. under a third-party contract with the Kellogg Company. At the time of the initial investigation the FDA declined to reveal the name of the manufacturer it believed to be responsible for the Salmonella outbreak.

It was only after the CDC had declared the outbreak to be over that the FDA revealed the name of the manufacturer.

The FDA also declined to identify the Salmonella serotype it had discovered during the inspection of Kerry’s manufacturing facility and declined to reveal whether the strain it found was a genetic match to the strain recovered from outbreak victims.

In July 2018 Kerry initiated a recall of 82 tons of Soy Honey Cluster. Two days later General Mills recalled six production batches of Cheerios Protein Oats and Honey cereal. In both cases the potential for Salmonella contamination was given as the reason for the recall. Yet no public notice was posted on the FDA website in either case.

What next?

The next step in this process will be for the Court to decide whether or not to accept the plea agreement.

The case has been assigned to U.S. District Court Judge James E. Shadid and Magistrate Judge Jonathan E. Hawley in Peoria Illinois and a sentencing date of March 14 2023 has been set.

Information regarding upcoming court hearings or other significant developments in the case will be posted on the DOJ’s Information for Victims in Large Cases website.

The trio make a big splash ahead of Super Bowl 57 in first teaser,"General Motors is back for another Super Bowl Sunday in 2023 building on the 2021 campaign that starred Will Ferrell and focused on the car brand’s electric vehicles (EVs).

That 60-second ad titled “No Way Norway” had a successful stretch during the Super Bowl commercial surge in ’21 placing sixth in the Ad Meter Ratings while enjoying a post-SB week that included a Replay Ratings nod for Best Comedy ad plus tons of internet and social media conversations—including one from Norway.

This year one more passenger is helping guide the creative vehicle in one of the more notable initiatives that truly highlights the common cinematic theme of “life imitating art.”

Enter Netflix.

“Entertainment has a huge impact on culture. We want to make EVs famous on streaming small and silver screens to build an EV culture through storytelling that incorporates the experiences of driving and owning an EV” GM’s Global Chief Marketing Officer Deborah Wahl explained in a statement. “Netflix is a great partner because of the company’s compelling storytelling commitment to sustainability and track record of sparking conversations that shape cultural trends. We are united in creating a better more sustainable future for our world as we bring everybody in on EVs.”

Netflix’s Chief Marketing Officer Marian Lee echoed that thinking: “At Netflix we create shows and films that can influence culture and spark meaningful conversations” said Lee. “From the TikTok dance trends inspired by “Wednesday” to thoughtful discussions about climate change with “Don’t Look Up” we know that entertainment can drive fandom and inspire connections. GM is a cultural leader in the auto industry and we are proud to partner with them in their efforts by amplifying the presence of electric vehicles in our shows and films.”

General Motors. Netflix. Will Ferrell.

It’s hard to imagine such a combo but that’s the quintessential formula for the big game ads—you never know!—and it also uncovers the worldwide demographic that will tune in on February 12…to watch the commercials.

Let’s just hope Ferrell finds a more helpful Zombie to get him back on “the 15” before then.

General Motors (GM) has announced that it will partner with Netflix to have its EV offerings displayed in shows on the streaming platform but they are far from the only automaker looking to show off its upcoming EVs.

GM is no stranger to marketing its EVs in fun and strange ways. Since its Superbowl ad about EVs in Norway stole the show back in 2021 the company has been dedicated to making marketing partnerships and creative ads that it hopes will bring new demand. Now the auto giant has doubled down partnering with Netflix to show off its new EVs.

“EVs on Screen” was created to “give EVs the stage they deserve” says the GM press release. This will include appearances on the “Love is Blind” “Queer Eye” and “Unstable” Netflix series that have each garnered significant attention. Vehicles like the Cadillac Lyriq the Chevy Bolt and the GMC Hummer EV are all expected to make appearances “where appropriate” says Netflix.

While no financial details about the Netflix deal were made public there is no doubt that GM made a big bet on putting its vehicles in front of the eyes of consumers. Yet with similar focuses on EV marketing coming from around the industry the deal certainly isn’t without precedent.

Other automakers are making similar moves in advertising EVs even vehicles that have yet to hit the road. Mid last year BMW unveiled its EV commercial series featuring Arnold Schwarzenegger whereby the famed bodybuilder dressed as the Greek god Zeus showing off the German brand’s newest electric models.

Nissan whose ads have often focused on the automaker’s participation in Formula E has also recently launched its EV ad series “EVs that Electrify.” While more subdued than the offerings from BMW and the General it still shows a dedication to guiding consumers to the future of mobility.

This leads to the question why such a focus on EV marketing? Particularly when the marketing focuses on vehicles that are not yet available? For GM the answer was simple; it’s a chance for exposure and to build the public’s understanding of EVs. “Entertainment has a huge impact on culture. We want to make EVs famous on streaming small and silver screens to build an EV culture through storytelling that incorporates the experiences of driving and owning an EV” said GM Global Chief Marketing Officer Deborah Wahl.

In complete opposition Tesla has remained starkly outside of the traditional marketing sphere instead opting for what supporters call a higher dedication to vehicle engineering or what critics call a higher dedication to Elon Musk’s Twitter account. Though Tesla’s success particularly in the North American market does seem to speak for itself.

It’s unclear if this new EV marketing push will garner the attention that legacy brands are searching for but at the very least the hunger for electric vehicles does seem to be building. But with an increasing number of competitive electric vehicles entering the market this year there is no doubt that the effect of these ads will become obvious fairly quickly.

Until 2019  pregnant women i n South Africa were excluded from receiving the treatment due to a lack of evidence on its effectiveness.

Pregnant women are at a higher risk of HIV infection due to hormonal changes and unprotected sex among other things.

The University of KwaZulu-Natal's (UKZN) Professor Dhayendre Moodley has led an international study that confirms the safe use of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in pregnant HIV negative women.



Until 2019 pregnant and lactating women in South Africa did not receive the PrEP roll-out due to a lack of safety data on its use in pregnancy.

Unprotected sex and hormonal changes among other factors expose pregnant women to a higher risk of HIV infection.

This was despite a 2018 study which found that women in two prevention studies were nearly three times more likely to become infected with HIV during pregnancy and four times as likely six months post-partum compared with the risk of HIV infection at other times the SA Medical Research Council (SAMRC) said.

The recent study – funded by various institutions including Gilead Sciences and the SAMRC as well as scientists from the universities of KwaZulu-Natal Stellenbosch Witwatersrand and Southampton in the United Kingdom – examined the impact of the treatment on pregnant women.

The researchers said:

Our findings suggest that initiation of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine PrEP in pregnancy does not increase the occurrence of preterm birth small for gestational age or any adverse pregnancy outcome.

""Moreover this study is likely to be the last clinical trial comparing PrEP with no PrEP and provides a valuable benchmark for adverse pregnancy outcomes for future planned studies of novel PrEP strategies.""

""HIV and AIDS remain a significant problem in South Africa where women continue to bear a disproportionate burden of HIV. We need to double down on interventions that can work. PrEP in pregnancy is the first step in preventing HIV in women and critical in our battle to eradicate HIV in children"" said SAMRC president and CEO Professor Glenda Gray who was one of the experts involved in the study.

For the last 67 years “Ferozsons has always been guided by our philosophy to put patients first and focus on critical unmet medical needs to save lives. We continue to bring most-needed medicines to Pakistanis at an accessible cost” Osman Khalid Waheed CEO of Ferozsons Laboratories Limited said in an exclusive interview with Gulf News.

Waheed’s great-grandfather Maulvi Ferozuddin Khan laid the foundations of the business group in 1894 with a vision to make a meaningful contribution to education and health. Ferozsons established its pharmaceuticals plant in 1956 to meet the health needs of the newly independent Pakistan.

The founder’s vision was “to focus on commercially sustainable work that had a direct impact on human development.” His philosophy is embraced by the company to this day. “We try never to forget that medicine is for the people” and the profits follow says Waheed who holds a bachelor’s degree in Economics from Harvard University and serves on the boards of the Lahore University of Management Sciences and several companies.

Focus areas

In the last six decades Ferozsons Labs has emerged as one of the leading Pakistani pharmaceutical manufacturing companies dedicated to providing advanced and affordable treatments for the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) diabetes cancer and heart diseases through its diverse range of more than 100 life-saving products (medications and devices). A major focus for the company is diabetes which is a leading cause of death in Pakistan with 33 million adults suffering from it the third highest number in the world after China and India.

Reducing the burden of Hepatitis C

Ferozsons has long been focused on treating hepatitis C a virus spread by contact that infects the liver. Pakistan has the world’s largest population of hepatitis patients with around 12 million infected by hepatitis B or C according to the World Health Organization (WHO) mainly due to the re-use of syringes and unhygienic health services. Hepatitis C is curable but the treatment was previously difficult and painful involving shots of interferon with flu-like side effects.

In 2014 US biotech company Gilead Sciences introduced a cure in the form of tablets called Sovaldi (Sofosbuvir) for treating hepatitis C. Ferozsons immediately signed a special access agreement with Gilead to make this revolutionary drug available to Pakistanis.

The drug which cost $84000 for a 12-week course in the US was made available in Pakistan for less than 2% of its US price to ensure its accessibility for the local population. In the first year the affordable and effective drug with a 95% cure helped treat over 70000 patients and has so far improved the lives of a total of 250000 patients in Pakistan.

Osman Khalid Waheed

The 12-week hepatitis C treatment in Pakistan now costs below Rs15000 (US$54) which is the lowest in the world. Ferozsons ensured direct-to-home delivery so that the drug reached patients who needed it rather than being misused for financial gain.

Describing it as one of the achievements of the Pakistani health industry Waheed said: “The impact of the Gilead partnership has been significant” as it transformed the treatment of hepatitis C. “From a very painful and not-so-effective treatment we went to a guaranteed cure almost free from any side effects”.

Pakistan’s first biotech plant

Ferozsons is the pioneer in setting up Pakistan’s first biotech manufacturing facility in Lahore through a joint venture with Argentina’s Bagó Group in 2008. The plant was established in response to the high cost of importing biological drugs such as treatments for kidney dialysis cancer and hepatitis C more sustainably and at a lower cost. The joint venture led to direct investment in Pakistan and “increased manufacturing capability in an area where we had zero capacity.”

Biomanufacturing is the production of biological medicines from living organisms. The powerful biologic drugs such as for cancer treatment are different from small molecule drugs such as aspirin due to their highly complex production process. The Pakistani firm is also the distribution partner of Boston Scientific a leading American producer of medical devices for treating heart disease and other therapeutic areas.

First Pakistani company to produce COVID-19 drug

In May 2020 during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic Ferozsons in Pakistan became one of five South Asian manufacturers authorised to produce and distribute the antiviral drug Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 in 127 countries. This was the first time a Pakistani manufacturer was selected for an international supply chain under technology transfer from Gilead.

Osman Khalid Waheed “It took us about 12 weeks from signing the licence to producing the first batch. It was all done at lightning speed” Waheed shared.

They started supplying Remdesivir to Pakistan in June 2020 and began exporting globally in September 2020 to countries such as Ukraine Indonesia the Philippines Costa Rica and African countries. This achievement was seen as an important step forward for Pakistan on both the health and economic fronts improving access to coronavirus treatment for citizens and providing export opportunities.

Expansion and exports

While the pandemic severely impacted lives and economies globally it also offered research and investment possibilities. Ferozsons invested in a large advanced highly-automated manufacturing plant to expand its manufacturing capacity and be ready to “produce specialty therapeutics and vaccines” in the future. The plant expected to be completed by mid-2023 “will produce specialty injections and treatments including insulins as well as select vaccines for hepatitis B and possibly for COVID-19 and influenza later.” This plant will have the ability to produce the most sensitive drugs that were imported before. The raw materials will still need to be imported as Pakistan’s pharmaceutical industry lacks the necessary ingredients. Ferozsons currently exports to 24 countries in Eastern Europe Africa Asia and South America.

Industry issues in Pakistan

While discussing ambitious plans the CEO of Ferozsons Labs said that companies could only become exporters if they are sustainable at home and lamented that Pakistan’s pharma industry has “never been financially viable due to the arbitrary price fixation mechanism imposed by the government” that is at odds with rising production costs. Despite its growth and reach “the industry faces issues around irrational drug pricing limited intellectual property rights protection lack of timely regulatory approvals and low investments for research and technological advancements” according to Qazi Mansoor Dilawar chairman of Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers’ Association (PPMA). One key challenge Osman Waheed cited was the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) controlling both quality and prices with “the focus being on fixing prices rather than raising the bar for quality control.” The result is that Pakistan currently has no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved labs according to experts.

Role of pharma in economy

On the contribution of healthcare to the world economy Waheed mentioned the growth of healthcare in India and Bangladesh. He recalls that Pakistan was the first in the region in 1992 to deregulate the pharma sector but reversed the mechanism within three months. India now exports pharmaceutical products worth $24 billion whereas Pakistan only earns under $300 million from pharma exports. Bangladesh is also an emerging giant in pharma with multiple FDA-approved facilities.

Waheed suggests moving away from price fixation to deregulation and oversight by an independent board to improve competitiveness in the industry. Price fixing in Pakistan is not only hurting the industry but the patients as well resulting in repeated shortages and the rise of smuggled and counterfeit drugs that fill the vacuum created in the absence of life-saving medicines. At the moment the health sector is besieged by shortages of multiple drugs needed to treat cancer diabetes tuberculosis and heart disease because of financial losses to the industry and import restrictions amid the economic crisis. The foreign currency shortage has disrupted the supply chain for both domestic production and exports.

Industry experts say revisions of laws and policies are critical for this sector to survive. “Pharma industry is facing an existential threat and is headed towards a shutdown if the government does not take quick action” Waheed warned. Drug pricing has always been treated as a political issue in Pakistan. “An industry that gets zero subsidies no support from the government is hostage to prices fixed by the government. It is completely irrational and creates a situation where everybody loses - the patient who is exposed to smuggled and counterfeit medicine; the government which directly bears the blame for shortages and the rise of counterfeit drugs; and the industry which is being driven to bankruptcy because of this failure of governance” says Waheed.

But there is still time and hope. This same industry given the space can be a reliable partner for meeting the country’s public health challenges and also be a meaningful contributor to diversifying the country’s export base.",,,,,,

But Talenthouse which boasts clients including Netflix Sony Coca-Cola and the United Nations has been accused of exploiting artists and failing to pay them in some cases leaving them thousands of pounds out of pocket.

The company based in London shares briefs from its clients and invites artists to create work that matches the brand’s demands – from designing a poster for a Hollywood film to an illustration for a drink brand’s social media campaign.



If their submission is picked the artist is paid a fee and the potential career benefits are huge: their work could be used in marketing materials and seen by millions of people around the world.

Since 2009 Talenthouse claims its service has helped level the playing field for artists internationally. On its corporate page it implores companies to partner with it because “purpose-driven brands do better”. “Up your integrity. Virtue signalling is not enough. Take action with Talenthouse today and democratise creativity” it adds.

However Talenthouse contributors say the company is failing to deliver on its promises. The Observer has spoken to 12 creatives including visual artists a photographer and a scriptwriter who say they have not been paid money they are owed by Talenthouse after completing briefs for companies including DreamWorks Nationwide and Snap.

The group includes creatives in the UK US Poland India and the Philippines. The problems are believed to be more widespread with others describing similar experiences on social media.

One artist Sarah Sumeray 37 from Crouch End London said she has been waiting six months to be paid for a Talenthouse project from March 2022 creating a poster for the animated DreamWorks film The Bad Guys. Sumeray spent three days creating a unique design which she later learned had been selected by DreamWorks. According to Talenthouse’s terms she should have been paid $2000 (£1600) within 90 days.

But the payment window came and went and despite emails showing she repeatedly chased the company she says she has still not been paid. “At this point I’ve given up on getting the money. But it’s so disrespectful to treat hardworking artists like this” she said. “It was quite a big deal to be selected for something like that and it’s quite a chunk of money. It’s just not fair.”

Another UK artist Helen Clamp 39 from Fishponds Bristol responded to a brief posted in August on behalf of Nationwide asking for artists to submit illustrations for use in a social media “money mindfulness” campaign.

Clamp’s design was chosen in October and should have earned her £500 from Talenthouse within 90 days. But she was not paid either. After raising the issue with Nationwide Clamp and others who were selected for the campaign received the money directly from the building society.

While she says Nationwide dealt with her case “really well” she is sharing her story because she believes there is a “bigger problem” with Talenthouse’s payment practices. “I don’t want them to just get away with treating people like this” she said.

Others understood to have been affected by the payment issues include an artist from Poland who is owed €600 which she says is “six months late” an illustrator from Florida who is owed $2000 for a project completed in October 2022 and a script writer from Los Angeles who is owed $2500 for a project completed via Talenthouse which he was supposed to be paid for three months ago. All provided documentary evidence such as emails and contracts to support their claims.

In the Philippines Robert Acle 47 said he is owed $3720 after completing four projects via Talenthouse between April and August 2022 but only receiving payment for two. “The excuses are always the same. They are having some issues with client payments so they’re behind” he said. “We felt exploited and discriminated against and we have no legal means readily available to demand for our right to be paid.”



In emails to creatives Talenthouse has admitted experiencing problems paying artists and has apologised. In one email sent to a creative a company representative said they were “so sorry” the fee had not been paid and that the company had “experienced delays with funding coming in which has in turn put a delay on outgoings”.

But artists have questioned why the company continues to advertise new briefs on its platform. This weekend several projects were live and actively inviting submissions.

In financial statements posted online for investors Talenthouse has claimed to be enjoying strong growth. According to its latest report from November 2022 revenue grew by 29% and gross profit by 64% in the third quarter of 2022 compared with the same period in 2021 driven by a recent acquisition.

The company which is listed on the Six Swiss stock exchange also began new deals which added to its revenue streams including “signing exciting projects with Trivago Razorfish (World Cup video campaign) and several others”. “The number of customers generating over $1m in annual revenue for the company grew considerably in the last two years” the report added.

Zita Holbourne joint chair of the Artists’ Union England said it was “totally unacceptable” that Talenthouse contributors had not been paid. “Artists can’t live off thin air. The work is very precarious as it is and you really need to be paid promptly and on time” she said.

She said the payment problems raised wider ethical concerns about the business models of companies like Talenthouse which rely on artists submitting work speculatively. Those whose work is not selected are not paid. Artists are routinely asked to grant permission for their work to be used at the point when they submit it.

Roman Scharf the co-founder of Talenthouse and chairman of the board said: “We are extremely sorry for this unacceptable delay in payments and any inconvenience and upset it has caused. We take this matter extremely seriously and are working on a long-term robust solution that will benefit all Talenthouse creatives. This solution is well advanced and we plan to announce it soon.”

Nationwide said it had commissioned Talenthouse to help with content for its Instagram feed and that it had “paid upfront for the work”. When it found out artists had not been paid within 90 days as they should have it “took the decision to pay the 11 artists directly … so as not to inconvenience them further”.

A spokesperson for the building society said that working with Talenthouse had enabled it to access artists it might not have found otherwise. It has one outstanding brief with the company and said it would ensure the selected artists were paid on time. “We have no plans to commission any further work with them” they added.

DreamWorks Animation said it was addressing the allegations with Talenthouse. Snap said it was looking into the matter.

There is no suggestion that artists who responded to briefs for other Talenthouse clients have suffered payment problems.

Clamp said she had little sympathy for Talenthouse’s claims about cashflow problems. “An ethical company should be ringfencing the part of their income that is due to go to artists who need to be paid” she said. “From the outside it looks like a legitimate business. But its claim to democratise creativity is a sham.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidWh0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jaWFsaXQubmV0L2Jsb2cvcGF5bWVudHMvd2lsbC1kb2dlY29pbi1iZWNvbWUtdHdpdHRlcnMtb2ZmaWNpYWwtcGF5bWVudC1uZXR3b3JrLXByb2plY3RpbmctcG9zc2liaWxpdGllc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Will Dogecoin Become Twitter's Official Payment Network?

Today Microsoft Overstock Tesla and Starbucks are among the many companies currently accepting Bitcoin for payment of goods and services. Alternatively crypto holders can also use them for shopping purposes purchasing gifts and may even convert them to fiat currencies at a crypto ATM.

Popular social media platform- Twitter is the latest company flirting around cryptocurrencies. It is rumored to be considering adopting the popular meme coin- Dogecoin to receive payments for its services. Surprisingly this is not the first time the technology company is linked with cryptocurrencies as Jack Dorsey its former CEO once contemplated adopting Bitcoin for payment. However the new rumors may be close to the truth as the company's new owner- Elon Musk is a firm admirer of Dogecoin.

However before we continue it is crucial to understand Dogecoin Elon Musk's relationship with the meme coin and why Twitter may likely adopt it for payments.

Understanding Dogecoin: What Is Dogecoin?

Created in 2013 by Jackson Palmer and Billy Markus Dogecoin is a peer-to-peer open-source cryptocurrency and the first meme coin in the world. Like many meme coins it was created to mock the hype surrounding cryptocurrencies in 2013 on social media and uses the image of the Shiba Inu dog as its trademark logo. As a meme coin its price is also low and its supply is unlimited with https://bitcoin-loophole.io giving proper details of these values.

Its blockchain relies on the underlying technology of Litecoin with many believing it is a replica of the cryptocurrency. Alternatively like Litecoin it also utilizes the proof-of-work consensus mechanism. Dogecoin is also an inflationary coin different from deflationary cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Fortunately the crypto bull run of 2017 did not exempt Dogecoin as it gained massively in price value. This fortune led to increased interest in the digital asset growing its popularity on social media. However the massive interest lasted only a short time as the meme coin fell with many other cryptocurrencies in the bear run of 2018.

Meme coins are typically backed by a strong community of supporters who utilize and trade them. This is why today Dogecoin remains the strongest currency of its holders who mostly use it for payment and tipping purposes on social media platforms like Reddit. In addition in October 2021 AMC Entertainment announced to its customers that it would start accepting the utility meme coin as payment for its digital gift cards.

Currently Dogecoin is available for purchase in many crypto platforms including Binance Crypto Engine Coinbase and Kraken. It is also the 8th-ranked coin in the crypto market with a market capitalization above $13 billion.

Twitter And Cryptocurrency

Former Twitter CEO- Jack Dorsey is a Bitcoin evangelist and a foremost cryptocurrency investor. Jack Dorsey has never hidden his admiration for cryptocurrencies especially Bitcoin as he continues to discuss and promote its adoption globally. The investor and Block CEO has also contributed to and funded many causes seeking to increase crypto adoption in Africa and Asia. To create more advocacy for cryptocurrency the entrepreneur co-founded ""The Bitcoin Academy"" with iconic rapper Jay Z. The Bitcoin Academy is a resident program that raises awareness about cryptocurrencies via online and in-person classes.

In October 2020 Jack via his payment company Square (now renamed Block Inc) purchased 4709 Bitcoins to lead a new trend of institutional adoption of the cryptocurrency. At the end of the year the digital payment company also committed about $170 million to Bitcoin buying another 3318 coins. This investment made Jack and his company Square one of Bitcoin's foremost and leading institutional investors.

However in 2020 with Jack Dorsey at the helm of affairs there were rumors that Twitter was on the verge of adopting Bitcoin for payments. At the time Crypto analysts believed it was the right move considering that Dorsey the ""spiritual leader of Bitcoin"" was at the helm of affairs. Unfortunately that move did not materialize due to several publicly unknown factors. Today Jack has since moved on from the company he started with Dogecoin's foremost investor- Elon Musk taking over the social media enterprise.

Twitter New CEO Elon Musk And His Ordeal With Dogecoin

Twitter CEO and SpaceX founder- Elon Musk is a firm admirer of cryptocurrencies and does not shy from showing his admiration of digital assets. However Musk's admiration of Dogecoin is the loudest as he continues to influence the fortunes of the meme coin partly. Alternatively the businessman does not also shy away from Bitcoin an asset he and his company committed funds to in 2021.

In January 2021 Elon Musk tweeted about DOGE stating that he was part of a team working to see the cryptocurrency improve its transaction efficiency. Fortunately that tweet saw the price of the coin rise by more than 300% reaching a new all-time high. On the same day the Tesla CEO tweeted ""One word: DOGE and the meme coin witnessed a record-breaking amount of trading volumes in four hours.

Earlier this year Elon Musk in a tweet admitted to his followers that he would eat a happy meal on TV if McDonald's would accept Dogecoin as payment. That tweet positively improved the fortunes of Dogecoin as the cryptocurrency gained 9% within 24 hours. In May 2022 the Twitter CEO in a tweet also announced that Tesla customers can now pay for goods and services with Dogecoin. He also informed the public that SpaceX was also working on incorporating Dogecoin into its payment particularly for selling their merch. Like his earlier tweets that announcement spiked the price of Dogecoin as its fortunes increased within hours after the tweet.

https ://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1596718851097755648

Unfortunately in June 2022 famous Dogecoin investor Keith Johnson filed a $258 billion lawsuit against Musk claiming that the Tesla CEO was allegedly running a deceptive pyramid scheme to support the digital asset. According to Johnson Musk intentionally drove up the price of Dogecoin by more than 36000% in two years before letting it crash. Johnson is asking the court to order Musk to pay him $86 billion in damages and $172 billion in capital losses all of which he had incurred trading Dogecoin since 2019. Surprisingly after Musk received the lawsuit he declared that nothing would stop him from supporting Dogecoin.

Elon Musk And Bitcoin

Musk remains a firm believer in Dogecoin admitting to his followers that he has some of it in his crypto wallet. He believes the cryptocurrency is one of the cheapest to invest in and continues to promote it like his own business. He has also mentioned that it is his best crypto asset and would never stop promoting the meme coin.

However the Twitter CEO is also an admirer of Bitcoin a digital asset he committed $1.5 billion from Tesla's fund into in February 2021. At the time Musk admitted that the digital asset was the future and that Tesla was considering adopting it for payment. Unfortunately the price of the digital assets had since fallen from the highs it was when Musk bought it with Tesla admitting that it has sold more than 75% of its investment.

Musk has also remained controversial around Bitcoin as his tweets have either spiked the digital asset price or contributed to its fall.

Will Dogecoin Become Twitter's Official Payment Network?

Earlier in April Elon Musk touted the idea of buying Twitter and completed the takeover of the social media company on October 27 2022 for a whopping $44 billion. That takeover instantly made the business manager the company's CEO and Owner and some other changes. Musk also proceeded to fire many top executives and core staff of the company including CEO Parag Agrawal. Alternatively hundreds of employees also resigned willingly with many citing that Musk's demands to commit to extra hard work were inhumane.

As an innovation Musk has also introduced a payment service- Twitter Blue to the social media platform. Twitter Blue is a premium subscription service set to elevate the quality of conversations on Twitter. It is an opt-in monthly subscription service that adds a verified blue checkmark to the user account and offers early access to new features like tweet editing. Unfortunately the service subscription has been temporarily suspended due to technical issues.

Surprisingly Musk's takeover of Twitter has also led to speculation that Dogecoin will become the official currency of Twitter as Musk has constantly reiterated that he prefers the meme coin over Bitcoin. Earlier this year in an interview with Times Magazine Musk was quoted saying that Bitcoin is not a flexible transactional currency and that the total transaction per day one can execute with Dogecoin has a higher potential than the digital asset.

Also in a recent tweet shared by Musk before the launch of the now-suspended Twitter Blue service he shared a slide of a company discussion around Twitter 2.0. Twitter 2.0 officially branded as The Everything App is a new version that promises users new and exciting features like long-form tweets encrypted direct messaging and the relaunching of Twitter Blue. However despite being an optional upgrade this value-added service will not come for free.

Surprisingly there have been many rumors concerning the payment method it will adopt as many on social media believe it will be Dogecoin. These rumors are not far from Musk who tweeted in April that should he complete the Twitter takeover Dogecoin will likely become an option for payment for the social media new subscription service. Earlier in the year Musk also promised that should he successfully integrate Dogecoin into Twitter users who pay with the cryptocurrency would get mouthwatering discounts.

Twitter And Dogecoin: Reactions So Far And What The Future Holds

As of today there is no official statement or guarantee that Twitter will adopt Dogecoin as it is all speculation. However there has been excitement in the Dogecoin community especially on social media since Musk took over Twitter. The community expects the Dogecoin advocate to promote the meme coin as they believe it will improve its fortunes in the struggling crypto market.

After Musk's takeover of Twitter Dogecoin rose by over 6% in price value. Alternatively its value has soared by more than 35% since rumors have been flying that it could be the first payment option of Twitter 2.0. If that eventually happens crypto analysts predict that Dogecoin's value will skyrocket and the cryptocurrency will reach new all-time highs overtaking many altcoins. Furthermore if and when Twitter adopts Dogecoin the cryptocurrency will also gain an astronomical amount of users becoming an altcoin that investors can no longer ignore.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmV1cmFjdGl2LmNvbS9zZWN0aW9uL2dsb2JhbC1ldXJvcGUvbmV3cy9lcmRvZ2FuLXNheXMtd2VzdGVybi1lbWJhc3NpZXMtd2lsbC1wYXktZm9yLXRlbXBvcmFyeS1jbG9zdXJlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Erdogan says Western embassies will 'pay' for temporary closures,"Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said Western missions would “pay” for issuing security warnings and temporarily closing consulates in Turkey last week while police said there was no serious threat to foreigners after detaining 15 Islamic State suspects on Sunday (5 February).

Over the last two weeks far-right activists burned copies of the Muslim holy book the Koran in Sweden Denmark and the Netherlands acts that prompted Turkey to halt negotiations meant to lift its objections to Sweden and Finland joining NATO.

The European countries have denounced the incidents but some say they cannot prevent them because of free speech rules.

Over the last week France Germany Italy and the United States were among those issuing warnings to their citizens of an increased risk of attacks in Turkey particularly against diplomatic missions and non-Muslim places of worship. Germany France and the Netherlands were among countries that temporarily closed diplomatic missions in Turkey for security reasons this week. Some cited central Istanbul areas of high concern but did not provide the source of the information.

The envoys of Belgium France Germany Italy the Netherlands Switzerland and Britain were also summoned according to foreign ministry sources in Ankara.

Ankara summoned the ambassadors of nine countries on Thursday to criticise their decisions to temporarily shut diplomatic missions and issue security alerts. Turkish officials said the following day that Western nations including the United States and Germany had not shared information to back up their claims of a security threat.

“The other day our foreign ministry summoned all of them and gave the necessary ultimatum told them ‘You will pay for this heavily if you keep this up'” Erdoğan said during a meeting with youth that was pre-recorded and broadcast on Sunday.

Alongside the closures several Western states warned citizens of a heightened risk of attacks to diplomatic missions and non-Muslim places of worship in Turkey following a series of far-right protests in Europe in recent weeks that included several incidents of burning copies of the Muslim holy book the Koran.

Turkey suspended negotiations for Sweden and Finland’s NATO accession last month following a protest in Stockholm during which a copy of the Koran was burned.

Protests in Stockholm including Koran-burning draw condemnation from Turkey Protests in Stockholm on 21 January against Turkey and NATO including the burning of a copy of the Koran heightened tensions with Turkey at a time when the Nordic country needs Ankara’s backing to gain entry to the military alliance.

Erdoğan said that the Western states were “playing for (more) time” and that the “necessary decisions” would be taken during Monday’s cabinet meeting without elaborating.

‘No concrete threats’

Earlier on Sunday police said they had not found evidence of any concrete threat to foreigners in the detentions of 15 Islamic State suspects accused of targeting consulates and non-Muslim houses of worship state media reported.

Anadolu Agency cited an Istanbul police statement saying the suspects had “received instructions for acts targeting consulates of Sweden and the Netherlands as well as Christian and Jewish places of worship”.

While the suspects’ ties to the jihadist group were confirmed no concrete threats toward foreigners were found the statement said.

Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu repeated on Saturday Turkey’s frustration with what it says is Sweden’s inaction toward entities that Ankara accuses of terrorist activity. All 30 NATO members must ratify newcomers.

Turkey Sweden and Finland signed an agreement in June aimed at overcoming Ankara’s objections to their NATO bids with the Nordic states pledging to take a harder line primarily against local members of the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) which took up arms against the Turkish state in 1984.

(Photo courtesy of GoFrogs.com)

TCU baseball hasn’t made it to Omaha Nebraska home of the College World Series since 2017. Reaching the grandest stage of college baseball is the goal of every program and it’s incredibly hard to accomplish even with an abundance of elite prospects.

The Frogs made four straight College World Series appearances from 2014 to 2017 establishing themselves as a blue-blood program. After two subpar years in 2018 and 2019 and following a season cut short due to COVID-19 in 2020 the Horned Frogs dominated the Big 12 Conference winning back-to-back Big 12 Regular Season Championships.

Although the Frogs found recent success in the Big 12 Conference they failed to make it past the regional stage of the NCAA Baseball Championship.

On the opening day of Spring practice second-year head coach Kirk Saarloos the 2022 Big 12 Coach of the Year looked over towards the College World Series banners hanging on the left field fence of Lupton Stadium.

“[The banners] stare at us every day” Saarloos said. “It’s time to get back there.”

High expectations and ambitious goals

The Frogs were eliminated from the College Station Regional in 2022 by Texas A&M and former head coach Jim Schlossnagle who led the Aggies to the semi-final of the College World Series. Seven months later the Frogs are set to begin the 2023 campaign and expectations are high.

Although talented players such as shortstop Tommy Sacco and starting pitcher Riley Cornelio left for the MLB draft the Frogs reloaded and brought in D1Baseball’s No. 8 transfer class and No. 6 Freshman class. The Frogs also have an experienced group of veterans including centerfielder Elijah Nunez a 2023 Big 12 Preseason First Team member and third baseman Brayden Taylor the 2023 Preseason Big 12 Player of the Year.

The preseason rankings reflected the offseason success as the Horned Frogs are ranked No. 1 in the Big 12 Preseason poll and No. 15 in D1Baseball’s Preseason top 25. Taylor entering his junior season said “rankings are just numbers” adding that every team needs to prove its worth on the field.

“I mean you can be ranked number one and you can finish last” Taylor said. “You can be ranked last and finish number one.”

Taylor a Preseason All-American First Team member was straightforward with his goals for the season.

“Win a national championship” said Taylor. “That simple. It’s the goal of the team. I think we have the stuff to do it.”

Righthanded pitcher Luke Savage also on the Preseason All-Big 12 First Team shared the same sentiment with Taylor saying the team “doesn’t listen to the outside noise” and is playing to win championships.

“I mean our goal is obviously to win the Big 12 but that’s just a stepping stone in what we want to do” Savage said. “We want to go to Omaha and we want to win a national championship.”

A grueling non-conference schedule

To be the best you have to beat the best especially considering how facing quality opponents affects RPI a metric that ranks teams based on record and strength of schedule. Saarloos ensured the Frogs would face elite programs booking games against No. 10 Vanderbilt No. 8 Arkansas and Missouri at Globe Life Field to start the season.

“Yeah sometimes I question myself in terms of the scheduling” Saarloos said. “But I think there’s two schools of thought: do you get ready for a tough conference by playing games that you feel like you should win? Or do you get ready for your tough conference by playing really good opponents? And I think the best way to do that is … to play good opponents.”

Saarloos said the team will find out what they are capable of “real quick” and that achieving long-term goals will come down to taking “care of what’s in front of you today.” He mentioned wanting to take on a challenge rather than playing games the team is expected to win without an issue.

“I think ultimately it comes down to being ready for [the Big 12 Conference]” Saarloos said. “You know it’s gonna be another good year in terms of the teams in our conference.”

Before Big 12 Conference play TCU will have weekend series against Florida State a three-seed in the 2022 Austin Regional and San Diego a three-seed in the 2022 Corvallis Regional. The Frogs will also head to Minute Maid Park in Houston to face Michigan Louisville and Rice.

Taylor said he’s “very excited” to face challenging out-of-conference opponents throughout the season.

“Every team we’re going to be playing they’re going to throw their best at us” said Taylor. “And so we have to be on every game we play. So it’s going to be fun.”

The path to Omaha: What has to happen?

Even with the talent needed to reach the College World Series making it there is far easier said than done. What needs to happen for the Frogs to reach their hefty goals?

“Score more runs than the other team” Saarloos joked. “No … [we’ve] got to worry about ourselves.”

Saarloos shared a metaphor representing the team’s mentality saying you can use a telescope to see long-term goals and a microscope to focus on the present. To attempt to build a championship-caliber team the Frogs will use a microscope to improve on all aspects of the game on a day-to-day basis.

“[We’ve] got to think about today and then the next day” Saarloos said. “And then just keep stacking those good days on top of good days.”

The Horned Frogs’ season starts on Feb. 17 at 3 p.m. in a top-15 matchup against No. 10 Vanderbilt at Globe Life Field in Arlington Texas. Right out of the gates the Frogs will test their ability to compete with top teams and fight to build a strong resume for the NCAA Championship Tournament.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNpLmNvbS9tbGIvcmFuZ2Vycy9uZXdzL3RleGFzLXJhbmdlcnMtdHJhdmVsLWJlbmVmaXQtbWFqb3ItbGVhZ3VlLWJhc2ViYWxsLTIwMjMtc2NoZWR1bGXSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Texas Rangers Benefit from Major League Baseball's New Schedule,"The Texas Rangers will visit more ballparks in 2023 than in 2022 and that also comes with a travel benefit.

The new 2023 Major League Schedule will take a little getting used to for the Texas Rangers the rest of MLB and its fans.

But it has an upside for the Rangers — at least this year.

This year the Rangers will play every team in baseball for the first time thanks to a new schedule alignment that reduces the number of divisional games and expands the number of games against National League teams.

The Rangers will play 56 games against the American League West which is down from 76 last year (13 against each team). The Rangers will play 64 games against the other 10 AL teams and then 46 Interleague games.

In all the Rangers will visit 22 ballparks in 2023 which is actually up from last year’s 18.

But there’s an unexpected by-product for the Rangers — a little less travel.

The Athletic did the math on each team’s travel for 2023 comparing it to last season. While the Giants will actually end up traveling more than 11000 air miles this season compared to last the Rangers see the second-largest decrease in air miles in 2023.

Last year the Rangers traveled 38945 miles. This year the Rangers will travel 34373 miles a drop of 4572 miles. Only the Detroit Tigers get a bigger break from last year seeing its travel drop by more than 7000 miles.

The Rangers are coming off their sixth straight losing season. Every little bit helps if they want to be a contender.

By the way pitchers and catchers report for Spring Training to the team’s facility in Surprise Ariz. on Feb. 15 with position players to follow by Feb. 20.

The Spring Training game schedule starts on Feb. 24 with a game against Kansas City at the Surprise complex shared with the Royals.

The Rangers wrap up their exhibition season with a pair of games at Globe Life Field against the Royals on March 27 and 28. The Rangers open up the regular season at home against Philadelphia on March 30.

Does he deserve a second chance?,"While both teenagers ended up in state prison with life sentences Watt may someday have a life outside prison gates for one simple reason: he was 10 days shy of his 18th birthday when the killing occurred. Mattis eight months older than his codefendant will never have that chance — not unless the state’s highest court gives him one.

Sheldon Mattis was 18 years old on a September day in 2011 when 16-year-old Jaivon Blake was shot to death on Geneva Avenue. Mattis was convicted of first-degree murder while a codefendant Nyasani Watt was convicted of firing the shots that actually killed Blake.

The Supreme Judicial Court will hear arguments Monday in two cases aimed at ending sentences of life without the possibility of parole for “late adolescents” — those 18 19 and 20 years old. The companion case involves Jason Robinson who was 19 when police say he was involved in an armed robbery in which a Brighton business owner was shot and killed. Lawyers for Mattis and Robinson will argue that such sentences for young offenders violate the state’s constitutional guarantees against cruel and unusual punishment.

The Massachusetts legal system has been moving slowly but steadily down a path that recognizes what most parents know first-hand — that the still-developing brains of teens make them more prone to high-risk impulsive behavior. Taking that into consideration the US Supreme Court banned automatic life terms for those under the age of 18 in 2012. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court followed suit in 2013 banning life without parole sentences for juveniles; about two dozen other states have also banned the sentences.

But neuroscientists argue there’s nothing magical about one’s 18th birthday. In fact there’s a growing body of scientific evidence that “personality behavior and the brain itself all continue to change and grow markedly through late adolescence” according to an amicus brief filed by a group of neurologists and psychologists in the two cases now before the SJC.

“The evidence further indicates that most late adolescents [defined as 18 to 20 years old] will naturally grow out of this phase and fundamentally change their behavior including through neurological growth that enhances their capacity for reasoned decision-making under stress and future-looking orientation and are uniquely amendable to rehabilitation” the group argues in its brief.

If the court agrees with that premise then locking an 18-year-old away for life would indeed be cruel and unusual punishment.

A group of 23 retired judges including several former SJC justices former federal court judges and the Boston and Massachusetts Bar Associations agreed. In the group’s filing with the court contributors noted that based on their experience “on the bench and in practice late adolescents are emotionally physically cognitively and behaviorally indistinguishable from juveniles” and therefore “warrant the same protection against a sentence of life without parole as their under-18 counterparts.”

Some 203 current inmates in state prison among them Mattis and Robinson would be affected if the court agrees. No the cell doors would not automatically swing open but they would become parole eligible after serving 15 years of their sentences. And as the amicus brief filed by the Boston University Center for Anti-Racist Research (and others) points out Black people are serving life without parole sentences for offenses committed between the ages of 18 and 20 at 16 times the rate of white people.

Going forward the high court if it agrees with the premise could go one of two ways — it could simply extend the ban on life without parole sentences for those ages 18-20. Or it could require a second-round sentencing hearing to determine if indeed the offender is “permanently incorrigible” a route the group including retired judges argues would “lead to disparate and arbitrary sentencing.” And as the statistics show there’s been enough of that already.

This year as in years past legislation has been filed to change the state’s sentencing system to allow most prisoners serving life without parole to become parole eligible after serving 25 years. Other proposals are aimed at providing parole opportunities for aging inmates in this case for those over age 55.

Another good approach would be to raise the age limit for juvenile offenders to 20 as considered by a special legislative task force in 2020. But that idea has yet to find widespread support on Beacon Hill.

While California has passed bill after bill to broaden parole eligibility for young and aging offenders the Massachusetts Legislature remains stuck in neutral.

Which explains how the Supreme Judicial Court has become the last best option for fixing a criminal justice system that cries out to have the law at long last follow the science when it comes to justly dealing with young offenders.

David Solomon 61 started DJing in 2015 and founded his own record label in 2018 - the same year Goldman named him chief executive.

He and the bank insist there is no conflict of interest but on Sunday the paper analyzed his winning the coveted prize of remixing Whitney Houston's hit 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody' with the track released this summer.

Unlike cover versions remixes can only be legally done with permission from the publisher.

Solomon was granted permission by Larry Mestel whose music company Primary Wave is a client of the bank.

David Solomon CEO of Goldman Sachs took up DJing in 2015 as a hobby which he says relaxes him

Solomon was granted permission to remix Whitney Houston's 1987 smash hit 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody'

Mestel then convinced Pat Houston sister-in-law of the late singer and executor of her estate to agree.

Sony Music Entertainment which owns the original recording of the 1987 smash hit also approved it.

'There's a kind of prima facie appearance of: 'you scratch my back I scratch yours' said Yaron Nili an associate professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School who specializes in corporate and securities law.

Mestel defended the agreement.

'Our business is in part to get artists to cover sample and or remix our legendary song catalog' he told The New York Times in an emailed statement.

Larry Mestel whose music company Primary Wave is a client of the bank helped Solomon secure the deal

Tony Fratto a spokesman for the bank said that Solomon's lawyer dealt with Sony.

Fratto insisted there was no conflict of interest.

'The reporting is trying to assert that there is overlap or intermingling of David's music activities and his role as C.E.O. of Goldman Sachs' he said.

'It's clear that both David and Goldman Sachs have been scrupulous in keeping the relationship separate.'

Solomon who has not commented on the Houston deal has previously emphasized that all his DJing proceeds are given to charity.

Guillermo Page the assistant director of the music business and entertainment industries program at the University of Miami Frost School of Music told the paper Solomon's securing of the sought-after Houston song caused shock waves.

'When you're dealing with someone of the stature of Whitney Houston it's very likely that they have some restrictions as to who can use the sound recording' said Page.

'Just because you want to do your own remix or you want to make your own creation doesn't automatically mean you're going to be approved.'

Serona Elton the director of music industry program at the Frost School of Music noted that Solomon's remix had likely helped him gain his current 600000 monthly listeners on Spotify.

'It's a very high number for a relatively unknown artist' she said.

She said 'a really crazy hot track' like the Whitney Houston remix 'can cut through clutter and get attention.'

Solomon is seen DJing. He founded his own label in 2018

The financier earned $25 million in 2022 - a pay cut from 2021 when he earned $35 million

Mestel is seen with Pat Houston sister-in-law of Whitney Houston and executor of her estate

The paper further reported that a member of Solomon's staff was asked to liaise with the record label he founded to ensure there was no interference with his work schedule and DJing.

Brandon Launerts a former Goldman employee who worked in the bank's marketing department as a social media manager spoke to people working for Payback Records.

Two people said the calls were arranged to discuss strategies for promoting new music releases and appearances by Solomon and making sure his D.J.ing activities did not interfere with his Goldman commitments.

Fratto called the communications 'normal' because they involved coordinating on scheduling matters and to consider 'any potential risks' for Goldman.

He added that the calls are infrequent given Solomon's limited DJ engagements.

Solomon's DJing has previously caused headaches for the bank.

In the summer of 2020 at the height of the pandemic Solomon played at a concert in the Hamptons headlined by The Chainsmokers which violated numerous social distancing rules.

The organizers were fined $20000.

Andrew Cuomo the then-governor of New York announced the promoters were fined $20000

Solomon posted this flyer prompting the music festival on his Instagram page. His name circled in red is listed among 140 other acts

Solomon in July last year hit the headlines for playing a set at the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago appearing alongside Dua Lipa and Doja Cat.

In a podcast interview in 2021 he said making music helped him relax - and despite some telling him it posed a risk for his banking career he didn't see a need to stop performing.

'I thought about it and I said 'I enjoy this I'm not doing anything wrong I'm not breaking any laws I'm having fun'' he said.

'Why should I stop doing something I'm really enjoying?'",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIzLTAyLTA2L2dvbGRtYW4tcy1pbmZyYXN0cnVjdHVyZS1hcm0tbWFrZXMtYS0xLWJpbGxpb24tYmlvbWV0aGFuZS1iZXTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Goldman Sachs Makes €1 Billion Biomethane Bet in Europe,"Why did this happen?

Edwin Franqui 26 appeared in Hartford Superior Court with his attorney and turned down an offer from the state attorney to serve 25 years behind bars for the charge of accessory to murder.

Franqui is currently charged with murder accessory to murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree assault in addition to illegal possession of a weapon and four counts of violating his probation court records show. The state’s offer parred those charges down to one charge of accessory to murder Judge David P. Gold said Friday.

Franqui and his older brother — also named Edwin Franqui — are both charged in connection to the shooting of 19-year-old Junny Lara-Velazquez of Hartford who was shot while he was in a car on Capitol Avenue that crashed into a Subway restaurant just across the West Hartford town line on July 6 2020.

Police say Franqui shot into a car hitting and killing Lara-Velazquez and injuring a 17-year-old girl. Another passenger a 16-year-old girl suffered minor injuries in the crash.

Franqui was arrested on July 17 2020 and was released from custody on a more than $1 million bond.

If convicted of the charges Franqui faces a prison sentence that could be equivalent to life in prison Judge Gold told him on Friday.

The murder charge he faces alone carries a minimum sentence of 25 years behind bars Gold said and a maximum sentence of 60 years.

Franqui who is currently out on bond told Judge Gold that he understood that the plea deal he rejected Friday may not still be on the table if he changes his mind later on.

Gold told Franqui that there is “no guarantee” he would be offered a plea deal later on and that he should expect his case to go before a jury in the near future.

“You need to understand that it’s going to start sometime soon” said Gold.

The judge said his case has been added to the trial list and he expects it to take place relatively soon though a definite date has not yet been set.

Franqui’s older brother was arrested on July 23 2020. He was also released from custody on bond and his case is on the trial list but has yet to be scheduled. The elder Franqui faces charges of murder conspiracy to commit murder first-degree assault carrying a pistol without a permit and criminal use of a weapon court records show.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9tYXJjdXMtcm9nZXJzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTQwOTA0OTk30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Marcus Rogers Obituary (2023) - Unionville CT - Hartford Courant,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/hartfordcourant/name/marcus-rogers-obituary?id=40904997 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9oYXJ0Zm9yZGNvdXJhbnQvbmFtZS9tYXJjdXMtcm9nZXJzLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTQwOTA0OTk30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcnRmb3Jkd29sZnBhY2suY29tL25ld3MvZGV0YWlsL3JhbmdlcnMtcmVjYWxsLWZvcndhcmRzLXNhbW15LWJsYWlzLWFuZC13aWxsLWN1eWxsZS1mcm9tLXdvbGYtcGFja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,RANGERS RECALL FORWARDS SAMMY BLAIS AND WILL CUYLLE FROM WOLF PACK,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcnRmb3Jkd29sZnBhY2suY29tL25ld3MvZGV0YWlsL3JhbmdlcnMtcmVjYWxsLWZvcndhcmRzLXNhbW15LWJsYWlzLWFuZC13aWxsLWN1eWxsZS1mcm9tLXdvbGYtcGFja9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002562F424850>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

By Ronni Newton

The teens meeting at the Faxon Library are in various grades don’t all attend the same school and may not speak the same primary language but what they do have in common is the goal of supporting each other and those who have moved to West Hartford from other countries.

West Hartford Immigrant Teens is a new group of volunteers created through a collaboration between the West Hartford Libraries the West Hartford Mayors Youth Council and Golden Door Hartford. Open to West Hartford Public School students in grades 8-12 it’s self-described as a “peer to peer group for immigrant teens in West Hartford” with a focus on socializing community service and advocacy.

“The group began meeting last summer” said Kari Karp West Hartford’s Teen Services librarian. She said many of the teens are recent immigrants but a few are also allies.

The teens meet every other week for an hour at Faxon Library where they can socialize share experiences practice their English and plan and organize activities involving community service and support.

“The group started as an offshoot of the Mayor’s Youth Council. One of their platforms was celebrating diversity” Karp said.

A significant portion of the Feb. 1 meeting was focused on the first event in the “Art & Chat” series which is being held in the Faxon Library’s community room on Saturday Feb. 4. Artist Adeebah Alnemar now a West Hartford resident who is an immigrant from Syria will be teaching charcoal drawing to those who attend the free event. It’s as much a chance to practice English conversation in a fun and relaxed casual environment as it is a chance to acquire a new skill.

Erica Bloch originally from South Africa will lead a workshop on collage on March 4 at the Faxon Library from 10 a.m. until noon. Amal Zubeidy (from Iraq & The Netherlands) will lead the final event of the series on LED embroidery on April 1 from 10 a.m. until noon at Studio 20 South at the Noah Webster Library.

There are roughly 20 teens who belong to the WHIT group but not all can attend every meeting. On Wednesday the 11 present represented nine different countries – Pakistan Nepal China Vietnam Ukraine Russia Somalia Bolivia and The Netherlands.

Vitalina who chairs the group as well as Taya one of the members said the Art & Chat event is intended as a way to expand skills in art as well as to allow for conversation. The event was offered free of charge to people of all ages and supported through a “Celebrate All of Us” grant from the Thomas F. Kilfoil Memorial Bequest of the West Hartford Library Foundation.

“I think it’s a combination with the purpose to serve the community” said Donna another of the member teens. She said she enjoys being a part of the group for the opportunity to make new friends and share what is going on at each other’s schools.

Cindy who moved to the U.S. from The Netherlands about 10 months ago joined the group before the school year began. “I met a lot of people and that helped me when I went to high school” she said.

Ellen Saltzman-Fiske president and founder of Golden Door: A Center for Immigrants is one of the coordinators of the West Hartford Immigrant Teens group. She said that one of the additional purposes of the group is to provide advice to the Board of Education about how immigrant teens can better be served.

“We’re also looking to do outreach to the elementary schools to teach them about the cultures represented in this group” said Kris a native of Nepal who is a member of the group.

At the Feb. 1 meeting following the finalization of plans for the upcoming Art & Chat the group worked on a display for Norfeldt’s International Night which is scheduled for Feb. 9.

In the Star Wars Original Trilogy capper Return of the Jedi the heroes venture to the forest moon of Endor to disable the Empire's shield generator and help to obliterate the second Death Star.

The Rebel Alliance dispatches a team to Endor consisting of Luke Leia and the other main characters as well as a squad of ground troops. And among those soldiers is an older man with a distinctive white beard.

Then several decades later Captain Rex cropped up on the animated series Star Wars Rebels sporting facial hair that made him look quite similar to that specific Endor trooper. This of course led fans to speculate and theorize that these two men were one and the same. But are they? Perhaps not according to newly-revealed merchandise.

Hasbro Black Series Figure Possibly Disproves Fan Theory

Hasbro

A new 6-inch scale Star Wars figure from Hasbro's much-loved Black Series line was recently unveiled. The character in question: An Endor trooper. This figure includes swappable face plates so it can represent more than one squad member in case collectors want to build out an army.

Hasbro

One of the faces is indeed meant to be representative of that white-bearded man seen on the planet in Return of the Jedi. What's more notable is that he does not bear the likeness of Temuera Morrison who plays all of the clones in live-action.

Hasbro

All this means that the theory that die-hard fans have held so dear probably isn’t true. But even then Star Wars mastermind Dave Filoni has previously stoked the fires of this character from Jedi actually being Rex mentioning that he “really [does] think” they’re one and the same (Via Slashfilm):

”The one thing that I have toyed with and we’ll see how I feel about this this is probably a spoiler Carrie Beck but I gotta give them something. I’ve said absolutely nothing today. And my wife’s like yeah it’s just like being home. But I think the one thing I have really thought about is I really do think that Rex is that guy on Endor. I really do. Why else is there a bearded old guy on Endor Tano? Why? It makes no sense. If you don’t want that to happen do you know what that means? I’m gonna make that happen. I’m getting like Palpatine I’m getting power crazy.“

However later Filoni gave a far more ambiguous response (via IGN) noting that if fans think that Nik Sant is Rex then they’re perfectly welcome to do so even if it doesn’t exactly align with canon.

Lucasfilm

Captain Rex or Nik Sant?

It’s extremely important to note that if one looks up the bearded Endor trooper on Wookieepedia the go-to knowledge base for Star Wars he’s listed as Nik Sant firmly setting the record straight that he isn’t Rex.

Still as Dave Filoni himself said if audiences still wish to imagine that he’s Rex called into action for the decisive battle of the Galactic Civil War then that is absolutely their prerogative.

Because at the end of the day Star Wars is meant to be fun. Fan theories are what give momentum to this vast franchise and without them things would be a lot more boring.

At any rate the aforementioned Endor Trooper Black Series action figure has not been put up for pre-order yet but will cost around 25 dollars and be sold at most major retailers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vaW5zaWRldGhlbWFnaWMubmV0LzIwMjMvMDIvc3Rhci13YXJzLWZhbnMtZGV2YXN0YXRlZC1hZnRlci1sdWNhc2ZpbG0taWdub3Jlcy1lYXN5LXJldHVybi1vZi10aGUtamVkaS1jaGFuZ2Uta2IxL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Star Wars' Fans Devastated After Lucasfilm Ignores Easy 'Return of the Jedi' Change - Inside the Magic,"Star Wars has made many great changes but ignoring this simple change might hurt how fans view Star Wars: Episode VI — Return of the Jedi (1983).

The final film of the Original Trilogy is just about 40 years old. Not only did Return of the Jedi bring fans Ewoks a new Death Star Emperor Palpatine and a great final battle but it proved that heroes and villains could be redeemed. Darth Vader found his purpose again as Anakin and saved his son. Luke Skywalker showed love and mercy to his father instead of giving in to his hatred.

The Galactic Empire lost on Endor as new allies helped them destroy the Death Star II. Now fans celebrate the movie’s anniversary and remember what they love about the movie. Certain details like Vader’s face being seen by Luke Skywalker are more meaningful after decades of storytelling. One connection seemed to allude that a certain character from Star Wars: The Clone Wars made it into the movie.

Han Solo and Leia Organa ambushed the Imperial Bunker with an escort of rebel commandos one being an old man with a bushy white beard. Fans immediately saw this character after Star Wars: Rebels and couldn’t believe the similarities between the rebel commando and Captain Rex.

Dave Filoni had altered Rex’s character design to resemble the rebel commando and fans noticed. While the beloved creator never confirmed the news he teased the connection leaving fans to believe that Rex was actually on Endor helping Anakin’s children take down the Empire.

A new Hasbro toy from the beloved Star Wars Black Series line is one of the new figures created to celebrate the 40th anniversary. The figure shows off the bearded commando and doesn’t confirm that Rex is indeed the commando. Instead Star Wars intentionally labeled it as a rebel trooper. Fans have noticed when you look up who the Rebel commando might be the character is called Nik Sant.

Here are some pictures of the figure:

Filoni clarified that fans could believe that Nik Sant is just Rex but Star Wars doesn’t seem interested in confirming this popular fan theory. With Return of the Jedi’s 40th anniversary right around the corner it would have been the perfect time to confirm that Rex is the trooper but fans will have to deal with the fact that after Star Wars: Rebels we don’t know what happens to the iconic trooper.

He could appear in The Mandalorian or Ahsoka but Clones have accelerated aging so it won’t be too long before the character can’t appear in a series set after Return of the Jedi due to the clone’s old age. Rex is an old friend of Ahsoka Tano and Temuera Morrison is the right age to play the role so Star Wars should bring the fan-favorite character into live-action soon before it’s too late.

Do you think Star Wars should change Return of the Jedi to include Captain Rex?

Hershey Bears forward Ethen Frank can absolutely fly in a pair of skates.

That was on full display in Sunday’s 2023 AHL All-Star Skills Competition. The 25-year-old winger set a new league record in the fastest skater event.

Frank finished with a ridiculous time of 12.915 seconds to come out victorious. The next fastest skater on the day was Michael Carcone of the Tucson Roadrunners who finished his lap in 13.282 seconds.

The Bears forward’s time is even more impressive when you take into consideration that the fastest time in this event at the NHL’s version of this year’s skill competition did not come even close to Frank’s. Andrei Svechnikov of the Carolina Hurricanes won it with a best time of 13.699 seconds.

Here he is receiving his award.

This was Frank’s first AHL All-Star selection as he is amid a very successful rookie season in the league. He also combined with Riley Nash and Alex Belzile for some sweet tic-tac-toe goals in the Pass & Score event.

Before the break for all-star festivities Frank was named the AHL Rookie of the Month for January.

His 21 goals this season rank tied for first among rookies and he has tallied 37 points in 38 total games. During January he put up 13 points in 10 games during the month including seven goals and one game-winner.

The Bears signed Frank to an AHL contract over the offseason out of Western Michigan University. He led the NCAA in goal-scoring with 26 in his final year.

That's because buying it in the first place was his worst. He was in his 20s and fresh off a breakup when he saw the sleek model in a used car lot near his home in Arlington Virginia. He had a third party ensure the car and the deal were legitimate then paid $20000 for it taking out a loan to cover part of the cost.

""It nearly broke me"" Nassetta 60 tells CNBC Make It. ""I spent all my money on that stupid car.""

In retrospect it was a bad decision from the start Nassetta says: He was only making $17000 per year at the time. Almost immediately he had to spend an additional $2000 on a new steering rack — and the car's problems only got worse from there.

The Porsche was ""riddled with problems I couldn't afford"" Nassetta says.

Today a Porsche 944 can be worth upwards of $30000 depending on the year and condition according to car valuation site Kelley Blue Book. But Nassetta sold his car just 18 months after buying it and maintains it was his worst spending mistake — and the last sports car he'll ever own.

Sports cars are both a popular purchase and a common regret. Ex-NBA star Dwyane Wade for example told Men's Health in 2020 that the best financial advice he'd ever received was ""to get rid of about 16 cars.""

One of those cars was a $6000 per month Maybach that Wade said he rarely if ever drove. He eventually sold the entire collection he added keeping one Audi Q8.

Since 2007 Nassetta has driven something more practical: a four-door Lexus sedan he bought just after landing the top role at Hilton. The well-loved family car was new when Nassetta purchased it and has stood the test of time: In the 16 years he's owned the car he's put 115000 miles on it he estimates.

He also owns another car a 1969 Ford Bronco. The make and model's average cost is roughly $50000 according to automotive lifestyle company Hagerty — but for Nassetta the SUV's value is more sentimental.

Nassetta's family owns a ranch in Montana and Nassetta had once told a nearby auto mechanic that a Bronco was his dream car. In 2020 the mechanic called Nassetta to say he'd found someone nearby with the vehicle — but it was barely running.

Together Nassetta and the mechanic spent two years repairing the car completing the project last May.

""We repaired every little piece of it"" Nassetta says. ""What I've learned being at Hilton is I like building and I like projects. So doing that gave me great joy.""

It needs proper execution,"“Do you wish to see the future of energy?” asks Hardeep Singh Puri Union Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas during an interaction with Business Today. “Well it’s right there!” As the afternoon sun clears up the leftover January fog a row of solar panels gleam on the roof of his sprawling bungalow in New Delhi’s Lutyens zone. “India’s energy transition in some respects is a sui generis case. The country has to ensure the transition to green and sustainable energy without affecting energy availability and affordability” he emphasises.

The panels on the roof of Puri’s official residence serve as an apt metaphor for India’s ambitious target of achieving net zero emissions by 2070. The country is looking at getting there by meeting 50 per cent of its electricity requirements through renewable energy which is the highest among G20 economies.

India has made significant progress in this direction. By November 2021 it had successfully installed 156.83 gigawatt (GW) of green energy or over 40 per cent of the target capacity (390.8 GW) of 2030—a full nine years ahead of schedule. A confident Raj Kumar Singh Union Minister of Power New & Renewable Energy claims that India is now all set to breach the revised projection for 2030. “I will tell you right now that 65 per cent is an understatement as our established capacity today is 170-odd GW of non-fossil. We have about another 80 GW under construction. That makes it 250 GW!”

“Combating the ongoing climate crisis needs strong global cooperation to accelerate the transition to cleaner energy resources” says Anil Chaudhry Zone President and CEO & MD of Schneider Electric India. Referring to India’s current presidency of the G20 he believes that it will provide significant opportunities for the country to accelerate and demonstrate the actions being taken to meet its clean energy commitments. “India is exhibiting one of the fastest transitions to renewable energy” says Chaudhry. Adds Praveer Sinha CEO & MD of Tata Power: “From launching the International Solar Alliance in 2015 to setting a target of reaching net zero emissions by 2070 India is on the path of transformation. The 2030 goals that may seem very daunting and difficult are achievable with support and commitment from all stakeholders.”

Over the next few years Sinha expects to see movement on newer technologies including battery storage green hydrogen and small modular nuclear plants leading the growth of clean energy in the country.

Energy Security

Amid reports of India already having overtaken China in population both Puri and Singh would be mindful of the actions being taken by their ministries today laying a firm foundation in ensuring the country’s energy security. This is required to meet the prerequisite of rapid urbanisation expansion of transportation infrastructure increase in industrial production and a growth in electricity consumption in the decades to come. India the world’s fifth-largest economy imports nearly 85 per cent of its oil and 45 per cent of its gas requirements every year. And ever since the start of the Russian military action in Ukraine a year ago Puri is often found aggressively defending India’s purchase of Russian oil at several international forums. “If you have friends who are willing to sell us oil at a lesser rate we will buy from them” he tells BT in a lighter vein. In FY22 the country witnessed a 100 per cent increase in its oil import bill to $119 billion on the back of a recovery in global demand and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

With an aim to reduce its oil import dependence the central government intends to increase the country’s exploration acreage to 0.5 million sq. km by 2025 and 1 million sq. km by 2030. The 99 per cent reduction in no-go areas or places where exploration activity was prohibited earlier has resulted in freeing up 0.91 million sq. km area for hydrocarbon exploration. “If you are 85 per cent import-dependent you have to increase your exploration and production dramatically. We are setting up a National Data Repository (NDR) so that large companies can come and participate in energy exploration in the country’s sedimentary basins” says Puri. Not just that work is also underway on creating a cloud-based and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-powered NDR 2.0.

The government is also looking at augmenting blending of ethanol made from sugarcane and other agri commodities in petrol. Plans are afoot to increase ethanol blending to 20 per cent by 2030 from the current level of 10.17 per cent. Besides the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas has asked oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corporation Hindustan Petroleum Corporation and Bharat Petroleum Corporation to start preparations for a switchover to green hydrogen from grey hydrogen for hydrodesulphurisation (a process by which sulphur is separated from fuels). Puri refers to a 2017 meeting he had with then-acting US energy secretary Grace Bochenek after being newly inducted into the Union Cabinet. “She made an unusual request of ‘one for one for one’. When I asked her to elaborate she said 1 kg of green hydrogen for $1 for 10 years; that made me reach out to our oil companies. I asked them how capable were they of bringing down the price to $1?”

Ashish Gaikwad MD of Honeywell Automation India a leading integrated automation and software solutions provider believes that all such new initiatives under sustainability are not only helping in the cause of making the country energy sufficient but will also strengthen the economy. “What could be better than [that] for a country like ours which is dependent on supplies from outside for a large portion of its crude oil requirements? Other than being a tricky situation for our energy security it also takes a toll on our foreign exchange. If we reduce our import bill on that account it is going to benefit the economy and make the rupee stronger as our trade balance improves” he says.

The country’s ambitious renewable energy targets are already acting as a catalyst for the transformation of its power sector according to International Energy Agency (IEA) data. Going forward it will be equally critical to put the industrial sector on the same path through more widespread electrification material and energy efficiency technologies such as carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) and a gradual shift to lower-carbon fuels recommends IEA. However it’s not going to be easy. Tata Power’s Sinha warns that challenges such as the over-dependency of the solar supply chain on foreign counterparts financially ailing distribution companies lack of transmission and distribution infrastructure continued reliance on traditional fuels in some pockets of the country and lack of reliable electricity supply for rural consumers continue to impact the sector’s transformation.

The government has been trying to address these issues through a wide policy framework. A production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme has been announced for GW-scale manufacturing of high-efficiency photovoltaic cells and a 40 per cent anti-dumping duty has been levied on Chinese imports. In August 2022 the country’s power systems operator the Power System Operation Corporation (POSOCO) barred 27 power distributors from buying electricity from power exchanges to meet their short-term requirements over non-payment of dues to generators. Simultaneously the Electricity (Amendment) Bill 2022 that seeks to bring about comprehensive reform is currently under review by a parliamentary committee. More than 93.4 million LPG connections had been released till July 2022 for below poverty line (BPL) households under the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY) for cooking.

The country has also been trying to bring down the cost of storage of renewable energy. “You can’t have energy transition unless you crack the storage problem. Storage has to become viable. All these developed countries that have been talking about the need for climate action and energy transition have done nothing. The largest quantum of storage set up by them is 450 MW!” says Power Minister Singh. He says the disruption caused to global supply chains in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic was a lesson for the world and every effort must be made to expand them by moving away from lithium-ion to other battery chemistries. In April 2022 the Solar Energy Corporation of India a public sector enterprise under the Ministry of New & Renewable Energy came out with a tender for an aggregate storage capacity of 1000 MWh the largest such bid globally.

Honeywell’s Gaikwad is confident of India’s potential to deliver. “You will now see the announcement of giga factories… Giga factories for making solar panels fuel cells electrolysers and batteries; all of these components are essential for energy transition. These will be probably the world’s biggest such factories [in India] and will come about in a span of the next two to three years” he declares.

Hydrogen Hub

On January 4 India announced the National Green Hydrogen Mission. Power Minister Singh forecasts India’s emergence as the commodity’s leading supplier. “The [production] capacity for green hydrogen will go up from 5 million metric tonnes (MMT) to at least 10 MMT [by 2030] because we had started putting in place policies such as free transmission open access and non-applicability of cross-subsidy surcharges on renewable energy required for making green hydrogen much in advance.” He is quick to add that India can supply green hydrogen and green ammonia at prices that are less than what other countries can offer.

In the first phase of the mission the country is going to replace grey hydrogen used in oil refining and grey ammonia used in fertiliser manufacturing for domestic use. India’s current consumption of grey hydrogen and grey ammonia stands at 18 MMT according to government data. Referring to potential export markets for the commodity Singh says “Other countries need green hydrogen and green ammonia but don’t have the sun or land to produce renewable energy. But we have a competitive advantage; we have the sun land and a thriving green energy industry.” The government would also be announcing a PLI scheme for electrolyser manufacturing. An electrolyser is used to separate hydrogen and oxygen molecules in water to produce green hydrogen.

Upbeat with India’s initiatives Ahmad Chatila Promoter of the US-based venture capital firm Fenice Investment Group and former CEO of Sun Edison says that with green hydrogen the country has the potential to become a global energy supplier like Saudi Arabia. “In energy transition technologies you need three things—human capital; land and natural resources like sunlight and wind speed; and capital. India has the first two in abundance. So India can do 1 to 2 terawatts (TW or 1000 GW) of wind and hydrogen. No questions there.” Already the EU member states Japan and South Korea have evinced interest in sourcing green hydrogen and green ammonia supplies from India. Green hydrogen and other low-carbon technologies can potentially create an $80-billion market in India by 2030 says IEA.

But it’s not going to be easy. The country will need on average $160 billion per year in investments across its energy economy between now and 2030 to meet its zero-emission goals projects IEA. Another study by Standard Chartered puts this at $17.77 trillion by 2070. Therefore arranging access to low-cost long-term capital will be important. Yet despite the challenges India’s success will pave the way for other developing economies to also aspire for a low carbon robust economic growth. Or as Honeywell’s Gaikwad puts it it will establish India as the global leader in “the energy transition from molecules (fossil fuels) to electrons (renewables)”.

Bethesda Maryland-based Host Hotels & Resorts ended 2023 with $2.9 billion of available liquidity an amount that President and CEO Jim Risoleo said gives the REIT an advantage in negotiating acquisitions once attractive hotels and resorts hit the market.

""Frankly there just aren't a lot of properties that are currently listed for sale certainly not assets that would interest Host but that's really not slowing us down at all"" Risoleo said. ""We are talking to our competitors in the industry our friends in the industry and others to try to kick deals loose that are Host-type assets.

""We are leaning on our relationships. We're leaning on our reputation on our ability to close deals all-cash and that really gives us a very meaningful competitive advantage. And we believe this is the year to to get the balance sheet to work.""

Ideally the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon announce the first of several interest rate cuts Risoleo said and that will bring sellers out of hibernation.

""It's going to also spark competition for those assets"" that will come to market he said. ""Our point of view is we have the balance sheet; we can do it all. We want to get out there and we want to get ahead of the pack. And I hope over the course of the next several months that we're going to be able to tell you that we've been a net acquirer early in 2024.""

Asked about the wave of commercial mortgage-backed securities maturing this year and next and whether that will drive hotel sales Risoleo said the wall of distress hasn't materialized.

""This year there's about $26 billion of full-service loans that will be maturing and I know that earlier in the pandemic there was a lot of talk of distress"" Risoleo said. ""Frankly we haven't seen it materialize certainly not on assets or markets that would interest us. But we'll continue to track it.

""There may be pressure as we get later into the year because one of the things that other hotel owners are going to have to deal with sooner or later is reinvesting in their portfolio.""

Host is interested in acquiring large hotels and resorts with diverse demand drivers in the group business transient and leisure segments. Risoleo added ""bigger is better for us"" and that acquiring hotels in urban markets might be on the table again.

What's Next for Maui

Host's resorts on Maui — the Hyatt Regency Maui Resort and Spa the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani — continue to skew the performance of the REIT's portfolio as leisure demand decreased following the wildfires in August. Yet Host's Maui properties have benefited from a steady source of group demand.

Sourav Ghosh Host's executive vice president and chief financial officer said 2023 was ""the year of group and convention hotel recovery"" adding that group room revenue increased 21% year over year and the volume of group room nights sold recovered to 95% of 2019 levels.

""It is worth noting that our group results were positively skewed by disaster and recovery bookings in Maui"" he said. ""Group room revenue exceeded 2022 by 13% in the fourth quarter driven by an increase in both rate and room nights and we estimate roughly half of that growth can be attributed to recovery and relief groups on Maui.""

Efforts to rebuild Lahaina are ongoing and Risoleo said the west side of Maui will take more time to recover.

""In the interim we have been working with relief agencies in particular the Red Cross. We have contracted with the Red Cross for 350 rooms at the Hyatt Regency Maui through the end of May and we're hopeful that that will be extended while the recovery moves forward"" Risoleo said.

Host is also awaiting a resolution to Hawaii Gov. Josh Green's threat to ban short-term rentals if they aren't opened up as housing for displaced residents. In December Green said the state needed approximately 3000 short-term rental units set aside for Maui residents.

""March 1 is a pivotal date in our mind"" Risoleo said. ""The governor of the state of Hawaii has stated that if the owners of short-term rentals on Maui don't come to terms with allowing their units to be utilized by the displaced residents then he is considering a ban on short-term rentals. ... On the island of Maui in total there's about 30000 short-term rentals. It's quite significant and we're tracking it very closely.""

Risoleo added he hopes leisure travelers will return sooner to Host's two resorts in the Wailea area: the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort and the Fairmont Kea Lani. Host concluded 2023 by wrapping up a renovation of the Fairmont Kea Lani's lobby and guestrooms in December.

""We're confident that over time as the consumer begins to understand the differentiation between Wailea which is a completely different submarket than the west side and Ka'anapali that will lead the cadence of business pickup"" he said.

Full-Year Outlook and Earnings Highlights

In its 2024 outlook Host Hotels & Resorts forecasts hotel revenue per available room to grow between 2.5% and 5.5% over 2023.

For full-year 2023 Host's revenue was $5.3 billion up 8.2% over 2022 according to the REIT's earnings release.

Host's full-year net income was $752 million — which was up 17% year over year — and adjusted EBITDAre was $1.6 billion up 8.7% from 2022.

The company's portfolio achieved full-year revenue per available room of $211.71 which was up 8.1% year over year. Average daily rate was $300.66 which was 1.8% above full-year 2022. Hotel occupancy was 70.4% up 6.2% from 2022.

As of publication time Host's stock was trading at $20.48 per share up 5.2% year to date. The Nasdaq Composite Index was up 7% for the same period.

Its EVs are cool practical and ready to move off the beaten path without much hassle. But should you be ok with the company's decision to artificially limit the power output of its vehicles? Let's dig in.

Both standard and enhanced maintain R1T’s 11000 lb. towing capacity. pic.twitter.com/qovrKGQHey — Rivian (@Rivian) December 20 2022

Last year Rivian was in a bit of a pickle. It figured out that parts were getting more expensive with each new acquisition and the cost of churning out the quad-motor R1T and R1S units was not letting much room for sustainable profit margins. So it decided to hike prices for everyone including pre-order holders. That understandably angered many who believed they were going to drive all-electric pickup trucks or SUVs coming from Normal Illinois.With no bells and whistles on the R1T used to cost $67500 and the R1S $70000. These were deemed as incredible price points for what both Rivian units were capable of. They have impressed nearly everyone lately apart from some unlucky customers who went through some problems with charging or software issues.But Rivian quickly came to its senses after the backlash apologized for the rash decision and even allowed those who canceled their pre-orders to reinstate them at the original price. However the shenanigans weren't about to stop there. A couple of months later the automaker announced everybody that something had to change.So Rivian decided to cut the entry-level Explore Package altogether in August 2022. And it did so for everybody - even the early backers. R1T and R1S pre-order holders had to go back online and reconfigure their vehicles. They had to pick the better-equipped Adventure Package which added a minimum of $5500 to their vehicle’s price.At the time of writing the cheapest R1T (Adventure Pack Dual Motor and Standard Battery) costs $73000 while the R1S is $78000. So you can even get the EV tax credit for the automaker’s vehicles which makes the idea of buying one today pretty enticing. Most of those who got their hands on Rivian's products are not disappointed. That alone is enough to convince prospective buyers of the startup's seriousness.But before jumping on the criticism bandwagon you shouldn’t forget that Rivian was struggling with everything related to production (and the last two years were a true struggle!) while some lucky early owners were flipping their R1Ts for over $135000. Some asked for even more than that. So you can see why the young automaker was dealing with a frustrating issue.Still the company had $17 billion to burn in 2022 so things weren't that gloomy. They weren’t about to go bankrupt. For investors and the future of the company however the decision to hike prices was the right one to make.But pricing wasn’t the only issue. Rivian also announced that it won't deliver the R1T with the mega-cool camp kitchen cleverly hidden in the pickup truck's gear tunnel. It's going to be available eventually but nobody knows exactly when. Besides that according to customer reports from last year some of those who gave up on the nifty add-on managed to scoop up a unit faster. This came as a disappointment because themaker already gave up on including the tank-turn capability something that's left for the new EQG to debut next year.Then the power tonneau cover issue appeared. Those installed from the factory broke down for thousands of owners so Rivian decided to stop offering them and announced it's preparing a redesign. To this day a replacement has not been offered.On top of all this Rivian decided to change its plans and hurried up the cheaper dual-motor units that were initially scheduled to debut in 2024. To add salt to the wound it removed the option to buy the quad-motor versions of its vehicles together with the biggest battery pack. If customers want the longest range they must now pick the Dual-Motorvariant.But now the carmaker decided to pull a Tesla- or Mercedes-like move and added a middle option for the drivetrain.Today you can either pick an all-electric Dual-Motor R1T/R1S or a Quad-Motor pickup truck or. For both vehicles the upgrade from two motors for each axle to four motors with one for each wheel costs $8000. The Irvine-based manufacturer thought this wasn’t enough.So it debuted the Enhanced Dual-Motor option which sits between the Dual-Motor and the Quad-Motor Rivian vehicles. It’s only a software change and per the company it should go live this month.Right now the situation regarding the drivetrain options is as follows:Keep in mind that this is data submitted by the manufacturer. Actual figures might vary depending on the spec of the vehicle the tires and the state of charge.In an email sent to a couple of existing and prospective customers Rivian said that the upcoming enhanced dual-motor all-wheel drive option is just a software upgrade. Besides changing the horsepower and torque figures nothing else is different. "" Off-road driving dynamics including front-to-rear torque vectoring and independent brake actuation at each wheel are identical between Dual-Motor and Enhanced Dual-Motor options” added the company in that message.So customers will be able to pick the middle drivetrain option straight from the factory or pay for it separately since it just adjusts the settings via a software change that can be done over the air. Right now pricing has not been disclosed. We will soon learn how much Rivian will charge for giving its customers the right to use their cars' drivetrain to the maximum.Now should Rivian be left off the hook with this new change? Well I would dare to say yes. A pickup truck or an SUV with 600 hp is great for almost everything you might want to do. Nobody needs that one second shaved off of the naught to 60 mph time in real life. If what you are after is zero-tailpipe emission and offroad capability then the quad-motor is the best drivetrain option for the R1T or R1S Finally if a dual-motor customer may want to unlock their vehicle’s maximum potential for whatever reason they can pay for it. Arguably this can still be a little upsetting. Knowing that you can’t make use of your car’s entire power output unless you spend some more might nag some people. But let’s hope this feature won’t be locked away under a yearly subscription for those who didn’t pick the Enhanced version from the factory. In such a scenario my opinion would do a 180.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWxjYW1lcmF3b3JsZC5jb20vcmV2aWV3cy9ocC1zcGVjdHJlLXgzNjAtMTYtb2xlZC1yZXZpZXfSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,HP Spectre x360 16 OLED laptop review,"We think the HP Spectre x360 16 OLED is going to appeal to a broad range of people: those who want a versatile form factor those who want an OLED screen those who want some reasonable gaming performance those who work with digital art and more besides.

HP is one of the most experienced laptop makers out there and the HP Spectre x360 16 OLED is the latest in a long line of models with a 360-degree screen that folds right over – which might be one of the main reasons that you're thinking about picking this up.

The best 2-in-1 laptops and convertibles offer the convenience of a tablet but the power of a laptop and often comes with added bonuses like a stylus that makes it easier to draw on the screen mark up documents and edit photos.

As is common for HP laptops and indeed laptops in general this laptop is available with a selection of different specs to pick from. While the style ease of use and build quality is the same for each model you should pick an internal spec that works for your needs. Check the specs box on this page for the details of the review unit we were sent (it's the 16-f0057na model if you're shopping around online).

The HP Spectre fits into the premium range of HP laptops starting at around $1500/£1400. You can find guides to the best prices for the HP Spectre x360 16 laptops that can currently be found from online retailers below.

HP Spectre x360 16 OLED Key features

You'll see from that specs list that the HP Spectre x360 16 OLED has a well-rounded set of specs: not the absolute best on the market but powerful enough for most people. You can easily do day-to-day tasks on it you can do some gaming – albeit at lower resolutions and frame rates than on the best rigs – and you can do some heavy-duty photo and video editing too.

Unless you do all of your computing inside a web browser (think emailing social media essay writing and so on) you don't want to go less than 16GB of RAM these days and perhaps power users will be looking for a bit more in that department. However the size and sleekness of the laptop have to be taken into consideration and you can't of course get desktop-level specs inside this form factor.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 with 4GB of video memory is a welcome inclusion: serious gamers have now moved on to the RTX 4000 series but the RTX 3050 can still do a job with the best games of the moment and will also be able to lend a big hand when it comes to working with photos and videos on larger scales and at higher resolutions.

HP has been making these 360 laptops for several years where the screen folds right over back against the bottom of the device. It means you can use it as a makeshift and rather chunky tablet should you need to. You can also prop it up in a 'tent' mode for watching movies and making video calls – we're not sure that there's all that much demand for these alternative configurations but you may think differently.

If you definitely will utilize the 2-in-1 form factor however then this is one of the best in the business currently out there. The other standout feature is the razor-sharp 16-inch 4K+ OLED screen which offers fantastic contrast and blacks that are so black you almost get sucked into them as well as up to 400 nits of brightness and 100 percent coverage of the DCI-P3 color space. It's a great panel with a 16:10 aspect ratio that's perfect for work and websites (and less so for watching movies).

The screen and the 360-degree design are two of the main reasons to choose the HP Spectre x360 16 OLED but there's also an included stylus that charges via USB-C. If you need a device for digital artwork as well as for more conventional computing you're covered. Unfortunately there's no integrated slot for the stylus but it will attach magnetically to the side of the laptop display.

HP Spectre x360 16 OLED Build and handling

(Image credit: Future)

The HP Spectre x360 looks great in our opinion: attractively finished curved in all the right places nicely accented and with a superb screen. Pick it up and it feels like a really well-put-together machine which of course you would expect from HP after all of these years of the company making laptops. With a sandblasted anodized black aluminum finish you're likely to attract one or two admiring glances in the local coffee shop if you're pulling this laptop out of your bag.

There's a relatively large but tasteful silver HP logo on the back of the lid and even the audio and cooling fan grilles are well done. The only slight awkwardness we noticed was the cutouts for the HDMI and USB-A ports on the left and the latter even has a small covering on the bottom that needs moving to use the port.

Typing and using the trackpad is mostly a pleasure with a good amount of give on the keyboard and a smooth premium-feeling finish to the individual keys. The trackpad is fast and responsive although registering taps can take a little more force than we'd ideally like. There's also a subtle lighting effect on the keyboard that we really like (though you can switch it off if you prefer).

HP Spectre x360 16 OLED Performance

The combination of an Intel i7 processor and an Nvidia RTX 3050 GPU means you're going to get above-average performance from the HP Spectre x360 16 OLED. It has no issues at all for example managing dozens of browser tabs at once editing high-resolution images or encoding 4K video. This is a more than adequate portable creative station though nowhere near the fastest laptops on the market right now (which will cost you significantly more of course).

The standard PCMark 10 test returned a very respectable score of 4755 on this laptop (with scores of 6446 on Essentials 8342 on Productivity and 5429 on Digital Content Creation). We also played a bit of GTA V at decent graphics settings and a frame rate of 50-60 fps – it's an older game of course but it shows you what this laptop is capable of. When running demanding tasks it certainly gets warm underneath of the chassis but you're not going to burn yourself.

(Image credit: Future)

Battery life drops around 10 percent an hour when watching video at the maximum brightness and a low volume while in more general use you'll get 6-7 hours of use out of this. That's not up there with the longest-lasting laptops but you'll just about get a whole working day away from your desk – and remember the battery has that bright OLED panel to keep powering.

The quad-speaker system designed in partnership with Bang & Olufsen is fine as far as laptop speakers go but this isn't a laptop you're going to buy for the fidelity of its audio output. We should also mention the 5MP webcam and integrated fingerprint sensor that give you more convenient ways of logging into Windows.

HP Spectre x360 16 OLED Verdict

(Image credit: Future)

How much you love or loathe the Acer Predator Helios 300 is really going to depend on what you want from your laptop. Obviously the aesthetics of this laptop are designed to appeal to gamers down to the highlighted WASD keys on the keyboard – if you're not a gamer then you're not going to want this laptop.

If you are a gamer and you want a high-spec rig that's going to excel at other demanding tasks – like say video editing – then this may well fit the bill. It certainly impresses in terms of its performance its build quality and its size as well as the typing and trackpad experience. With so many similarly priced and similarly specced laptops around though we think it's going to be the looks of this model or perhaps some brand loyalty to Acer that will tip the balance in favor of the Predator Helios 300.

Then there are of course the best Macbooks to consider as well – not for gamers but great for high-end creative work. That's a lot of competition for this laptop but we reckon that it manages to hold its own as long as it's not going to be unplugged very often and you spend a considerable amount of time gaming.

HP Spectre x360 16 OLED Competitors

For creatives looking for a 16-inch laptop the latest 16-inch MacBook Pro is of course the obvious choice. It's just been refreshed with blazing-fast M2 Pro and M2 Max chips and while you don't get an OLED screen you do get significantly better performance – at a significantly higher price of course. If you've got the budget it's a very appealing laptop package even if you prefer Windows as a desktop operating system.

If you're after something that actually looks like a gaming laptop consider the Acer Predator Helios 300 – though it's worth noting that the GPU capabilities are about on par with the HP laptop we've reviewed here. The screen size gets upped to 17 inches though you don't get the OLED quality. It's perhaps worth considering if you want more configuration options and the ability to customize the lighting of your laptop.

The Himachal Pradesh transport department on Friday said it has become the first in the country to switch its entire fleet of petrol and diesel official vehicles to electric. Congratulating the department after flagging off electrical vehicles here Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu said the state has taken the lead in switching over to electrical vehicles and notifying its policy.As many as 300 e-buses will be added to the fleet of the Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC) for which an outlay of Rs 400 crore has been sanctioned he said.A target has been set to add 60 per cent e-buses to the fleet of HRTC in the next two years Sukhu added.""We are working in the direction of making Himachal India's first 'green energy state' by 2025"" the chief minister said in a statement issued here.He said the motive behind switching to e-vehicles was to curtail the unnecessary expenditure on petroleum products besides preserving the environment.""All government departments will be equipped with electrical vehicles within a year"" Sukhu said added that the Electric Vehicle Policy  2022 has also been notified.""We will completely transform the existing diesel buses into e-buses in a phased manner"" the chief minister added.The local bus depot of Shimla will soon have a full fleet of e-buses and an electric bus depot will also be opened in Nadaun he added.Electrical vehicle charging stations will be set up in a phased manner for which around 110 places have been identified. Besides 700 government buildings have been selected to set up charging stations the chief minister said.Deputy Chief Minister Mukesh Agnihotri who also heads the transport department said it was in record time that the department has pushed itself into green mobility.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvdHVuZWQtZzgyLWJtdy1tNC1zb3VuZHMtbGlrZS1hLXJpb3QtYmVsdHMtb3V0LTYwNy1ocC0yMDk3ODguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tuned G82 BMW M4 Sounds Like a Riot Belts Out 607 HP,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1dG9ldm9sdXRpb24uY29tL25ld3MvdHVuZWQtZzgyLWJtdy1tNC1zb3VuZHMtbGlrZS1hLXJpb3QtYmVsdHMtb3V0LTYwNy1ocC0yMDk3ODguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025622E63CA0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The Toronto athletes who joined forces in late October in a quest for a medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics lost 21-18 21-19 in quarterfinal play at the Aspire Park sports complex.

They finished the week with a 3-2 record topping Andressa Cavalcanti and Vitoria Rodrigues in their first of two matches on Thursday before a three-set defeat to recently crowned Beach Pro Tour champions Kelly Cheng and Sara Hughes of the United States.

""Winning our first match was like a bonus"" Wilkerson explained. ""We just stuck to what we were practising and feeling. There was a lot of confidence coming from our side just from preparation.""

A 2-0 victory over Nina Brunner and Tanja Huberli of Switzerland in their lone Friday match set up a round of 12 contest Saturday against the Czech Republic's Barbora Hermannova and Marie-Sara Stochlova who bowed 21-10 21-18.

Next up was Stam and Schoon the current European champions who went 3-0 in pool play with opposing tandems boasting world titles.

Stam 24 and Schoon 21 were in dominant form and are one win away from their fourth consecutive medal in international events.

""We're still feeling each other out"" Wilkerson said ""but as long as we do what we need and want to do the results are going to show.""

There were hints of a potential Wilkerson/Humana-Paredes future partnership on Sept. 4 when the 30-year-olds advanced to the Sept. 4 final of the AVP Pro Tour's Chicago Open in their professional beach volleyball debut. They lost two sets to one to rising American stars Kristen Nuss and Taryn Kloth.

Coy about future partnership

At the time Wilkerson's regular playing partner Bukovec was recovering from a sprained right hand.

A few weeks later Wilkerson was coy about possibly partnering full-time with Humana-Paredes telling CBC Sports: ""She can play AVP [tourneys] and Sophie can't so maybe people will see us play more."" Volleyball Canada then made sure of that by announcing the partnership.

""I feel like we've been working really hard for the last few months but haven't had a lot of competition"" said Humana-Paredes. ""I've been so excited to play with Brandie and now I got the chance to do it so it's like a dream.""

Two-time Olympian Sarah Pavan has now teamed with world silver medallist Sophie Bukovec Wilkerson's partner on the sand until late September. They went 1-3 in Doha dropping a three-set decision to Ana Patricia Ramos and Eduarda Santos Lisboa of Brazil in Saturday's round of 12.

The Doha tournament is the first at the international level in which teams can add points to their Olympic rankings that will determine the duos qualified for Paris.

Countries can send only two teams per gender to the Summer Games. The Olympic ranking qualifying window opened Jan. 1 and runs through June 9 2024 with the best 12 events per team counting toward ranking.

The winner of the 2023 world championships scheduled for Oct. 6-15 in the three Mexican cities of Tlaxcala Huamantla and Apizaco earns an automatic Olympic berth.

HBAN,Huntington Bancshares,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDIvMDQvYWZmaW5pdHktcGx1cy1jcmVkaXQtdW5pb24tc3QtcGF1bC1taWR3YXktdW5pdmVyc2l0eS1oYW1saW5lL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Affinity Plus Credit Union sees niche in St. Paul's Midway serving unbanked neighbors,"During the dog days of the pandemic as state employees began logging into work remotely Affinity Plus Federal Credit Union shuttered its Rice Street branch near the State Capitol but for a drive-through automatic teller. The full-service branch which has since relocated farther west will host its official opening Monday just off Hamline and University avenues in St. Paul’s Midway.

Its arrival nine years after the debut of the light rail finally fills out a block of long-awaited retail some of it almost equally fresh on the ground level of the Hamline Station apartments across from the Green Line stop of the same name. In addition to a new Affinity Plus branch the block is now home to the new Black Garnet Books a Boost Mobile shop a Jackson Hewitt Tax Service the Ding Tea boba tea shop a Pearle Vision location and the Master Noodle pulled Chinese noodle restaurant.

The opening of the Midway’s first and only credit union location also signals a bit of resurgence for the St. Paul-based financial institution which last opened a new branch five years ago in New Hope and relocated a branch last year in Mahnomen just outside the White Earth Tribal Reservation in northern Minnesota.

Following the worst of the pandemic “we’re back to normal operations if you will” said Amber Shanley director of branch services for Affinity Plus. “We’re trying to push ahead.”

The Mahnomen branch previously located within the Shooting Star Casino joined Affinity Plus during its acquisition last year of the White Earth Federal Credit Union which maintained no more than the single location and previously did no home lending of its own.

If the White Earth Reservation and St. Paul’s Midway areas have something in common it’s that both are home to high numbers of the unbanked or residents who don’t maintain traditional bank accounts because of poor credit lack of financial acumen or distrust of financial institutions. Rather than gloss over them Affinity Plus a member-owned credit union that surpassed $4 billion in assets this past December has embraced a growth strategy that courts rather than shuns low-to-moderate income residents.

In the Twin Cities metro some 65% of Affinity Plus members fall into that income category earning the credit union special designation from the National Credit Union Administration. Among its services members who qualify for “courtesy pay” can overdraw their accounts up to $100 without overdraft or insufficient funds fees. After that financial penalties as of last July were $15 per overdraft down from $35 previously.

Better lending rates smaller footprint

Designated NCUA low-income credit unions receive exceptions from a statutory cap on business lending they’re eligible for grants and low-interest loans from a Community Development Revolving Loan Fund and they can seek supplemental capital. In short they have extra leeway to offer unique services to the unbanked and the under-banked — members who might not otherwise be able to obtain loans or even bank accounts through other means.

Their structure has also allowed Affinity Plus to offer better rates than some much larger institutions for savings and home lending even if other assets are far smaller including their physical footprint. Affinity maintains its headquarters off U.S. 52 on St. Paul’s West Side at 175 W. Lafayette Frontage Road as well as a branch location on University Avenue and Huron Boulevard in Minneapolis by the University of Minnesota campus. Otherwise it’s less visible than many for-profit banks.

Other banks and lenders in the Midway — including Bank of America Huntington Bank and the UnBank Check Cashing and Loans on Lexington Parkway — are “philosophically a little different” said Shanley hours before the Midway location’s soft opening on Friday.

“We don’t have stockholders” she said. “As a not-for-profit we are beholden to make decisions that are best for our members — not for our profits. As a member you are an owner.”

The Midway branch stands out in other ways. Four of the five branch clerks are bilingual in Spanish and English and the fifth speaks Tagalog the language of the Philippines. “That happened by chance” said Shanley who filled out the employee roster with four internal transfers and one new hire. “At this location every employee is bilingual.”

In 2021 Affinity Plus teamed with the city of St. Paul to begin offering interest-free loans of up to $2000 to assist St. Paul residents seeking U.S. citizenship.

Affinity now maintains 30 branches all of them in Minnesota and some 560 employees. Unlike larger banks which have made a habit of laying off employees in their real estate division when the housing market cools Affinity has managed to retain employees in its home lending division even as home sales have decreased mostly by reallocating them to a “Solutions” division that functions like collections.

Affinity Plus is also a founding partner of Dora Financial an all-digital cooperative-owned credit union alternative targeted to unbanked members who might not otherwise qualify for credit-based accounts at traditional financial institutions.",,,,,,,,,,,,

MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined by a former top economic adviser under the Trump administration Gary Cohn who is now the vice chairman of IBM. Good morning. Good to have you back here.

GARY COHN: Thanks for having me.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So 517000 new jobs but a lot of companies particularly in tech are announcing layoffs. So exactly where's the economy headed?

MARGARET BRENNAN: So so it's interesting. We did see the 500000 plus new jobs which was quite surprising I think to many of us. But I think what we're actually seeing here is a renormalization of the new economy. A lot of the jobs that we saw were jobs in the service industry the service the industries coming back very strong because we're starting to see the economy go back to what we historically think of the economy. For the first time we've seen occupancy rates in offices in major cities over 50%. When you see occupancy rates go up you need the service sector to work. Think about people going back into the office. They need parking attendants. They need people to work in the buildings. They need security. They need people to clean the buildings. People stop for coffee when they go into the buildings. They go out to lunch. They go to bars. For the- for that to happen you need the service sectors to come back to work. So the 120000 service sector employees that came back to work that 100% correlates with people going back to what is the new normal. It may not be five days a week in the office but it's enough days in the week in the office where you need the service sector to come back to work. The interesting thing about last month's unemployment numbers is we brought people back to work but we did not have to entice them with pay. So the monthly the month over month number in wage gains was 30 basis points. The prior month was 40 basis points. So we're seeing we're getting people back into the labor force for a lower wage than we were prior to this.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And that's a little bit hopeful for you on the inflation front.

GARY COHN: Yeah and I think this is natural. I think what we've seen is after all the stimulus that was put in the system over the last three months people are running out of the stimulus money. We saw that in the fourth quarter of last year. We saw consumer spending slow down. We saw debit balances on credit cards go up. We started to see delinquencies go up. And you know what happened? People actually did the right thing and they went back to work. They're engaged and they reenter the workforce. And I think we saw a lot of that in the January numbers.

MARGARET BRENNAN: So these more positive signs have led Bank of America for example to say recession still in the cards but not until after March. I wonder what your thoughts are on that. And as CEOs warned about borrowing costs going up as a result of the Fed hiking. They are tightening belts. So how far off is this recession?

GARY COHN: Well we've got a couple of phenomena going on. Interest rates have been going up so borrowing costs have been going up for companies. On the flip side the dollar has been weakening. So the multinational corporations in the United States who repatriate earnings from offshore those repatriated earnings have become more valuable. I think the people that have been really worried about a recession in the first and second quarter of this year I think after what we've seen this week with both Chairman Powell's announcements and the data in unemployment I think that recession is off the table for Q and one in Q2 of this year. You know we're going to get another employment report before the next Fed meeting and we'll see where the economy's going. But it does feel like we're in relatively good shape here. The question is going to be how does the Federal Reserve handle what's going on in the economy? Are we going to continue to have to increase wages to draw people back in the labor force or are people coming back in the labor force because they need to? And we're not going to have wage inflation if that happens. The Federal Reserve is actually in a very good place.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Let me ask you about something the Fed chair said this week. He said Congress has to lift this debt ceiling. I'm throwing one of the things that could screw up your- your rosy prediction at you. He said no one should assume that the Fed can protect the economy from the consequences of failing to act in a timely manner. He's warning he's not making plans for a default. You're on your own if it happens.

GARY COHN: Yes.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Should there be a plan for the Fed to step in? I mean I know legally it's in question here but I talk to people on Capitol Hill who say Wall Street is not taking this seriously enough. The politics are really bad around the debt ceiling.

GARY COHN: The politics are very bad. You know the one thing is every American every American is holding the US government to raise the debt ceiling. The full faith and credit of the US dollar and the US dollar being the reserve currency is imperative to our economic well-being as a country. We ultimately have to get the debt ceiling raised. That said what's going on here is not something out of the ordinary. If you look at debt ceiling raises over the last 40 or 50 years no matter which party is in the minority about 50% of the time debt ceiling raises come with some amendments attached- attached to them from the other party. So this is quite an. Normal the process that we're going through.

MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't sound overly concerned.

GARY COHN: Like I'm always concerned when we're dealing with debt ceiling but I have a feeling that we will get there in the end when we have no other choice. You had this- you had the speaker here last week and he felt confident that we would get there when we had no other choice. The speaker met with the president of the United States this week. The two of them came out of the meeting relatively confident. I feel they both understand there is no choice. In the end of the day we have to raise the debt ceiling. The question is can the Republicans get something in the legislation attach the debt ceiling legislation that they want that they feel like is a win and the Democrats are willing to give it to? Historically that is what's happened numerous times.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. And the risk there is real. I want to ask you as well about China. Mark Warner was here with us last week and he said technology competition with China is the biggest issue of our time. He's worried about things that- like your company does IBM in terms of quantum computing. Is enough being done to keep America competitive on that front?

GARY COHN: Well we're starting you know if you look at where we've been this year you know we passed the CHIPS Act in the United States which you know is- is- is something that's not a normal motion for us in the United States for the federal government to pick and choose--

MARGARET BRENNAN: To subsidize.

GARY COHN: --an industry and and to subsidize. It really is not a normal action- is an action that you know historically I probably not would have been have supportive. I was extremely supportive of the CHIPS Act we at IBM was extremely supportive of the CHIPS Act. If we learned nothing else from the pandemic we learned that there are certain goods that are necessity goods for this country to have and we are overly reliant on places like China. And if we don't find ways to change the manufacturing system in the supply chain and move it back to the United States where we can take care of ourselves we have made a catastrophic miscalculation. Chips are one of those areas where we cannot depend on the rest of the world and run our manufacturing business and continue to grow our economy. Pharmaceuticals is another area where we really have to move that industry and that manufacturing back to the United States. So I think we really have to evaluate what are the most crucial and sensitive businesses or industries that we cannot live within the United States. And we're going to have to make real investments in those here in this country.

MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll keep talking about it with legislators. Have to figure out how to pass some of those laws. We're going to take a quick break. And when we come back we'll be talking with four members of the freshman class and the 118th Congress.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vY3VycmVudGFmZmFpcnMuYWRkYTI0Ny5jb20vbmFzYS1hbmQtaWJtLXBhcnRuZXJzLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWFpLWZvdW5kYXRpb24tbW9kZWxzLXRvLWFkdmFuY2UtY2xpbWF0ZS1zY2llbmNlL9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vY3VycmVudGFmZmFpcnMuYWRkYTI0Ny5jb20vbmFzYS1hbmQtaWJtLXBhcnRuZXJzLXRvLWJ1aWxkLWFpLWZvdW5kYXRpb24tbW9kZWxzLXRvLWFkdmFuY2UtY2xpbWF0ZS1zY2llbmNlL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NASA and IBM Partners to Build AI Foundation Models to Advance Climate Science,"IBM has partnered with NASA to gain new findings on Earth’s climate through the power of AI technology.

Definition and Examples,"Quantum Computing which utilizes the strange properties of quantum mechanics is a new type of computer technology. With quantum computing we can perform complicated calculations significantly faster than with our current computers.

The computers you and I use today use binary bits to store data as either a 0 or a 1. Quantum computers use qubits i.e. quantum bits which can exist in different states simultaneously.

According to IBM one of the world’s leading technology corporations:

“Quantum computing is a rapidly-emerging technology that harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers.”

Quantum computers – speed

By using qubits quantum computers can process a large number of solutions to a problem at the same time. They are especially well suited for physicists mathematicians astronomy and other number crunchers for whom computers today are too slow.

Quantum computers are ideal for for example optimization cryptography and simulating the behavior of quantum systems.

Manipulating qubits

Superposition

Quantum computers use superposition and other techniques to manipulate qubits. Superposition allows qubits to exist in many different states simultaneously.

Entanglement

These futuristic computers also use entanglement where one qubit’s state correlates with that of another.

Thanks to superposition and entanglement quantum computers can perform certain types of calculations at incredible speed.

Where are not there yet

To be able to use quantum computing technology on a large scale we still need to overcome some challenges. For example the qubits’ delicate quantum state is easily disrupted by temperature and noise which makes it extremely difficult to build a large-scale quantum computer.

Experts say that they have made significant progress in recent years and hope to have usable quantum computers on the market in the not-so-distant future.

These amazing machines could one day revolutionize how we solve complex problems. They could also bring an explosion of new scientific breakthroughs.

Early days

Quantum computing is still in its early developmental stage. The technology has not reached the point of widespread commercial adoption. When it becomes mainstream which is expected to occur in the near future it will transform the world of business education healthcare finance telecommunications transportation energy cybersecurity artificial intelligence material science and science as we know it.

Some innovative ideas in drug discovery complex logistics biochemistry and cryptography will only be possible when we have computers that are much more powerful and faster than our current ones. Quantum computers will make that possible. Artificial intelligence will become unimaginably more sophisticated.

But such wonders of science exist today. And while much work lies ahead they’ve been preventing cancer and saving lives for more than four decades.

“If you took a poll and asked people ‘Do we have a vaccine against cancer?’ people would say no” Karen Knudsen CEO of the American Cancer Society tells Fortune.

“They really don’t know that we do.”

Pharma giants BioNTech and Moderna recently made headlines for exploring the potential of mRNA vaccines first employed with COVID to treat cancer. Such vaccines use lab-created messengers of sorts that teach the body how to mount an immune response.

But clinical trials have long been underway using more traditional vaccine technologies—and participants are already receiving cancer vaccines many personalized. A handful of vaccines have already received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. And cancer-preventing vaccines have been around since the 1980s.

If this is news to you you’re not alone. Doctors don’t always offer cancer-preventing or cancer-treating vaccines to patients—due to lack of knowledge or bias against certain racial gender or age groups.

“Patients need to advocate for themselves” says Dr. Nina Bhardwaj director of immunotherapy at the Vaccine and Cell Therapy Laboratory and co-director of the Cancer Immunology Program at The Tisch Cancer Institute at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.

We tend to think “the doctor is absolutely right” she says. “But that’s not always the case by any means.”

What is a cancer vaccine?

Cancer vaccines are not much different from vaccines for infectious diseases like the flu measles mumps and COVID Dr. Keith Knutson a professor of immunology at the Mayo Clinic who researches and develops cancer vaccines tells Fortune.

Vaccines stimulate the immune system to fight a target—usually a virus. In this case however the target is cancer.

Right now the bulk of cancer vaccines are therapeutic—used to treat patients who already have advanced cancer often in concert with other interventions like chemotherapy surgery or radiation. Two are currently approved by the FDA according to the Cancer Research Institute: one for early-stage bladder cancer and another for prostate cancer.

But there are also vaccines for cancer survivors. They’re given to those in remission with a high risk of relapse Knutson says. He’s heading up a Defense Department-funded study testing vaccines intended to prevent the recurrence of triple-negative breast cancer.

Then there are the vaccines that can prevent cancer altogether. There are four that are FDA approved: three for HPV or human papillomavirus and one for Hepatitis B. All work to prevent infections that can lead to cancer down the road. The HPV vaccine is recommended for males and females around age 11 or 12 but can be given as early as 9 and as old as 26. The Hep B vaccine is recommended for everyone age 59 and younger and adults 60 and older who are at risk for infection.

While approved cancer-preventing vaccines are few in number they’re having an outsize impact. The HPV vaccine drove a 65% decline in cervical cancer for women in their early 20s from 2012-2019 according to data released last month by the American Cancer Society. Such women would have been among the first to receive the vaccine approved by the FDA in 2006.

Similar reductions should eventually be seen in other cancers caused by HPV that usually occur later in life like head neck oral rectal and vulvar cancers according to Knudsen.

“It’s a major win for science” she says referencing the new data on the vaccine’s success. “We really can end cervical cancer as we know it for everyone if vaccination happens”—and the same should hold true for other HPV-related cancers.

Another target many researchers have their eyes on: breast cancer. Labs around the world including Knutson’s are particularly interested in developing vaccines that could prevent the most common cancer in the world—or at least prevent it from returning in survivors.

Knutson’s lab is working on a vaccine that targets six points of attack frequently found on breast cancer. Fortuitously many are also found in lung ovarian and pancreatic cancers.

“We may be generating immunity that targets breast cancer specifically but we think that immunity may also be protective against other cancers as well” he says.

How cancer vaccines work

At the moment vaccines that treat active cancer exist in trials with few exceptions. They’re not cures however—and receiving one is much more complicated than going to a pharmacy and getting a COVID or flu vaccine.

Personalized cancer vaccines are common within clinical trials. But developing them is a lengthy process. And as Dr. Phillip Febbo chief medical officer at biotechnology company Illumina says “Cancer doesn’t wait.”

Febbo calls personalized cancer vaccines “bespoke therapies.” For each patient a specialist must determine which tumors can be reached via a biopsy. Then the patient must undergo the biopsy and have their tumor cells genetically sequenced by a company like Illumina. The sequence is analyzed to determine what vaccine composition is likely to be most effective in the particular patient. Then the personalized vaccine must be produced and delivered to the patient.

Each step can take weeks if not months—usually about six months in all according to Knutson. Time is “something we’re struggling with on a daily basis” he says.

Illumina is providing genetic sequencing capabilities to Moderna for its melanoma-prevention vaccine given to those who’ve been diagnosed and had their tumors removed Febbo says.

Patients who took both their new vaccine and Merck’s Keytruda a monoclonal antibody therapy that helps immune cells kill cancer cells were 44% less likely to die or have their cancer return when compared to a group that took only Keytruda the companies announced in December. The drug is moving on to a Phase 3 trial the last before potential FDA approval.

Febbo’s company has reduced the time of whole genome sequencing to around one day instead of weeks he says—a move that facilitates quicker delivery of custom vaccines.

Knudsen Knutson and others are intrigued by the apparent success of Moderna’s cancer vaccine. They’re hopeful that mRNA technology is the key to speeding up the process of personalizing cancer vaccines—the side effects of which are much more bearable than that of chemo.

“We’re in a new era now having just seen mRNA vaccines” Knudsen says. “Is mRNA vaccine technology a new frontier for us? It’s still an open question.”

How to get a cancer vaccine

The future of cancer vaccines is bright experts say—but perhaps not equally bright for everyone.

All experts Fortune spoke to expressed worries that new medical technologies like cancer vaccines could disproportionately benefit the privileged—and remain out of reach for many members of marginalized populations.

It’s a trend seen in clinical trials in general and one that isn’t new to health care Bhardwaj says.

“The poor or underserved populations are less likely to be included” she says.

Biases unconscious and otherwise exist—often against non-white patients women and older individuals. Due to this doctors may not recommend clinical trials or some treatments and “patients need to advocate for themselves” she says.

Case in point: Black men are around twice as likely to die of prostate cancer than white men. “Some of that is because we don’t understand enough about the genetics of risk” she says. “But some of it is lack of access to care and clinical trials” which offer “the most advanced form of care.”

If patients are interested in vaccines that may exist for their cancer—approved or in clinical trial—they shouldn’t wait for their oncologist to bring up the possibility experts tell Fortune.

“Ask ‘Am I eligible? What would the benefits and concerns be? What are my treatment options?’” Knudsen advises. “Get a second opinion when you can.”

How close are we to widespread availability of cancer vaccines?

The bulk of current cancer vaccines are for those with advanced disease. It’s the “natural progression of medicine” to start with those most in need Febbo says. “We make progress and then we take that progress and march up earlier and earlier” in disease stage.

Knutson predicts a growing number of therapeutic cancer vaccines will be developed over the next decade. There are many ongoing Phase 2 and some Phase 3 clinical trials for such meaning more help should be on the way relatively soon he says—with an emphasis on “should.”

Sometimes the issue isn’t a lack of new successful treatments but a lack of funding to carry them through to the finish line.

“Part of the problem is and continues to be—in all realms whether cancer vaccine or some other kind of treatment—that somebody needs to pick up the (cost of the) higher level clinical studies” like Phase 3 trials he says.

“An academic like myself can probably get through Phase 1 or 2 and show promising results but the competitive landscape and what’s popular amongst investors and what’s not determines whether one goes to Phase 3 clinical trials.”

There’s “no question a lot of opportunities have been missed” throughout the years Knutson says. In a worst-case scenario his team develops a successful cancer vaccine but can’t secure the resources for a Phase 3 trial necessary for FDA approval.

In such a circumstance he finds it encouraging that future researchers will be able to build upon the progress his team made by reading their publishing findings.

“Although it may be disheartening that I may not see this particular vaccine or that particular vaccine move forward I’ll know that I’ve contributed to a scientific basis that guides the future” he says.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Brookfield a major infrastructure investor put up $2 billion in equity and borrowed $13 billion from a mix of foreign banks pension funds and sovereign wealth funds ­according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the details weren’t public. That model isn’t new to infrastructure assets just to semiconductors says Scott Peak Brookfield Infrastructure’s chief investment officer for North America.

For Intel bringing in a deep-pocketed investor to cover 49% of the plant’s cost helps to support finances stretched by an ­unprecedented expansion plan a tough competitive landscape and a steep industrywide downturn. (In late January the chipmaker gave one of its gloomiest forecasts ever sending shares tumbling.) When the deal was announced in August Intel described Brookfield’s rate of return as “somewhere between its cost of debt and equity” which it pegged between about 4% and 8.5%. Intel declined to provide more details.

How the investment plays out will demonstrate whether private equity firms and their growing infrastructure funds can be part of the plan to reassert US competitiveness in chip manufacturing. Governments in North America and Europe are trying to rebuild that strategic capability and reduce their reliance on plants in East Asia. Brookfield’s Peak estimates that $1 trillion of capital is required for what Brookfield considers “large-scale critical manu­facturing” in areas such as semiconductors aerospace auto and gigafactories data management and telecommunications.

“There are a lot of infrastructure categories that are well-­established that were not on an investor’s radar 5 or 10 years ago—think data centers towers and fiber” Peak says. “New asset classes evolve and with them come new models and contractual arrangements that attract the right investor base.”

The growing need for semiconductors and the high valuations of companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. have attracted interest from investors. Firms including KKR & Co. and Blackstone Inc. have raised war chests to invest in the space as the definition of infrastructure stretches beyond toll roads and ports to data centers cellphone towers and fiber networks. In December AT&T Corp. and a unit of BlackRock Inc. announced plans to form a joint venture that will provide internet service to US customers outside AT&T’s traditional 21-state local phone territory.

Intel which named the new funding model SCIP (sounds like “skip”) for semiconductor co-investment program is already being contacted by investors with access to pools of private capital looking to form partnerships on other fabrication plants known as fabs in Ohio and Germany according to people familiar with the matter. Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger said in January that the company expects to create a second SCIP this year.

“Given the multiyear horizon of our investments in capacity and product road map we are focused on creating multiple pools of capital to support our strategic investments and enhance our flexibility which is particularly important during short-term periods of business disruption” says Dave Zinsner Intel’s chief financial officer. SCIPs “provide the added benefit of better aligning our capital requirements with our cash-flow-generation timelines as new fabs typically require more than two years of investment before coming online and generating revenue.”

Building plants and making chips require expensive state-of-the art technology that can become obsolete in as little as five years. That makes it riskier than the projects infrastructure investors are accustomed to which remain in use for decades. So unlike a traditional joint venture in which profits and losses are shared according to each partner’s investment in this deal Intel provided Brookfield with some protection against losses. On the flip side if the plant proves more profitable most of the benefits will accrue to the chipmaker.

In the eyes of rating companies that downside protection negates one benefit of the deal: that Intel can keep about half of the cost off its balance sheet and preserve its credit rating. Instead the rating companies view Intel’s guarantee to Brookfield as debtlike. That may affect companies’ willingness to embrace similar deals says Jason Pompeii an analyst for Fitch Ratings. Financing multiple projects in the same way could weigh on Intel’s credit rating.

Intel could tweak the structure of future partnerships to make the deals less debtlike and it’s getting help from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. people familiar with the matter say. The company should also benefit from subsidies and other incentives in the US Chips and Science Act which is designed to boost domestic production of semi­conductors.

For Intel’s Gelsinger the Brookfield deal helps fund one of the first steps in his plan to remake the company and reclaim leadership in the $580 billion industry it once dominated. He’s introducing new technology at a faster rate than ever to make Intel’s plants the world’s best. The company is also building factories across the US and Europe to produce its products as well as to manufacture for other companies even rivals.

The rate on the Brookfield financing now looks attractive as inflation has sent the cost of borrowing up steeply. But in the high-stakes game of semiconductor manufacturing success will depend on whether Intel can keep those factories producing high-priced electronic components at maximum capacity. As one of the world’s few remaining large-scale manufacturers of semi­conductors it has an advantage. Work at existing plants in Arizona Oregon Ireland and Israel could be shifted to the new factories to make sure they’re performing at levels that will ensure the deal’s terms don’t become burdensome.

Deals beyond semiconductors could follow says John Buchanan a Lazard Ltd. banker who advised Intel. “It’s a chance for companies with big physical assets to raise money at an attractive relative rate” he says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob3Jvbml4LmNvbS9uZXdzL0ludGVsLURPSVQtRE9JVE0tRGV0YWlsc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A Detailed Explanation On Intel's DOIT Mode Possible Options For Linux's Handling,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.phoronix.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/Intel-DOIT-DOITM-Details (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025628FF59C0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBob3Jvbml4LmNvbS9uZXdzL0ludGVsLURPSVQtRE9JVE0tRGV0YWlsc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRvbXNoYXJkd2FyZS5jb20vbmV3cy9pbnRlbC1hcmMtcmdiLW1vdXNlcGFk0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel Selling RGB Arc Alchemist Mousepad to Celebrate its GPUs,"If you're a fan of Intel's Arc GPUs you'll love this new accessory. Intel is selling a new Arc-inspired RGB mousepad (via its Intel store) that can fit under both your keyboard and mouse. The mousepad measures 36.5 x 15.5' (930 x 400mm) and is made of a soft fabric designed for all mice sensitivities and optics. A USB-C port powers the RGB lighting.

The mousepad's color theme is the same as Intel's Arc GPUs featuring a pink and blue color combination. Its graphics feature two very bright RGB halos one complete and one not complete. The right one is a complete ring representing where your mouse should be located while the other is just for show being a much larger halo that protrudes beyond the edges of the mousepad so only a part of the ring is visible.

These pink and blue halos are the same halos you'll find across all of Intel's Arc GPU advertisements and presentations.

Unlike more traditional RGB mousepads that use a hard surface along with bright RGB perimeter lighting Intel's mousepad is the opposite utilizing a softer diffused RGB lighting solution along with the use of softer fabric material. The dimmer light gives the mousepad a more mature look and can be less distracting when gaming while the soft fabric material allows you to fold the mousepad for much easier transportability if you need to take it with you on vacation or on a business trip.

For now the super wide 930 x 400mm form factor is the only size Intel carries. We don't know if Intel will expand its portfolio of sizes but we hope to see a normal-sized version at the very least for those of us who only use mousepads for the mouse alone.

Unfortunately Intel's mousepad does not come cheap being priced at $64.77. Similar mousepads with cloth material and RGB illumination can be found for under half that price. But if you want to show your love for Intel's discrete GPUs some of which are now among the best graphics cards this mousepad provides a great way to do so.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9pbnRlbC1wcmVwYXJpbmctY29yZS1pNS0xMzQ5MGYtY3B1LXdpdGgtaW5jcmVhc2VkLWNsb2Nrcy1hbmQtbW9yZS1jYWNoZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel preparing Core i5-13490F CPU with increased clocks and more cache,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='videocardz.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /newz/intel-preparing-core-i5-13490f-cpu-with-increased-clocks-and-more-cache (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025628FF7A00>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9pbnRlbC1wcmVwYXJpbmctY29yZS1pNS0xMzQ5MGYtY3B1LXdpdGgtaW5jcmVhc2VkLWNsb2Nrcy1hbmQtbW9yZS1jYWNoZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9ob3ctdG8tb3ZlcmNsb2NrLWludGVsLWFyYy1ncHVzL9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9ob3ctdG8tb3ZlcmNsb2NrLWludGVsLWFyYy1ncHVzLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to overclock Intel’s Arc GPUs for better performance,"Intel’s Arc GPUs are here and (assuming you can find one) they’re reasonably priced and we’re impressed with their capabilities even when paired with a Ryzen processor.

Difficulty Moderate Duration 1 hour What You Need Intel Arc GPU for desktop

As with CPUs overclocking options on GPUs raise the frequency at which the card operates increasing your performance – while also raising the operating temperature and potentially power demands. Here’s how to overclock your Intel Arc GPU to balance performance with thermals.

How to overclock Intel Arc GPUs

These steps assume that you are using a desktop Arc GPU. Mobile Arc models are not designed to be overclocked and won’t work the same way.

Step 1: Enter the game that you want to use as a measure for performance improvements. Ideally it would be a game with a very high threshold for frames per second and similar measurements as well as one you play frequently and can notice improvements or problems with more quickly. Some games will simply show clearer results than others.

Step 2: If you didn't download the Arc Control center when installing your GPU you can download it with the latest Intel Arc Graphics Windows DCH Driver -- it's available here. Reboot your system when the driver has finished downloading.

Step 3: Open the Arc Control center by pressing Alt + I on your keyboard and head to the Performance tab.

Step 4: Bring up Telemetry and grab some benchmark readings from the current state of the GPU so you know how it’s currently running. Note measurements like memory utilization clock speed power increases and temperature. These aren't the only indicators of GPU performance but they are a good way to see how the GPU is currently functioning and when it may be pushing its limits.

Step 5: You should also record the current frames per second (fps) -- if you're unsure here's our guide on how to record your fps -- as well as other performance indicators that you care about. You may even want to take a couple of screenshots. This gives you a valuable baseline to judge how much things can improve with overclocking.

Step 6: In the Performance tab find the section that says Performance tuning and select the Configure button.

Step 7: Now an array of options will open with sliders to adjust specific settings. We suggest starting with the GPU power limit and GPU temperature level sections. These create parameters that other settings must follow so they’re a good place to begin.

Step 8: Arc Control has some built-in safeguards here but it’s important to proceed carefully to avoid damage or unexpected problems. You may not want to max these sliders out right away but you should at least push them toward their upper limits to give the GPU the freedom it needs to overclock. By default they should be fairly high already so don't be afraid to give them a push.

Step 9: Now take a look at the section called GPU performance boost. GPU performance boost is where you’ll be telling the system how much to overclock within the parameters that you have set. Try a third of the slider to start – or less if you want to go slower.

Step 10: Voltage offset meanwhile is a measurement for how much additional voltage the GPU is allowed to use. Typically you want this as low as possible without crashing or experiencing performance problems so you should only start raising this once you hit stability problems with standard overclocking and if you really want to push your card hard.

Step 11: Fan speed can be left at Automatic for now. You can tinker with setting manual fan speeds later if temperature control becomes an issue.

Step 12: Make sure the Apply setting on system boot toggle at the top is turned Off for now but once you have a stable overclock you're happy with set it to On.

Step 13: Now you are ready to select Apply and update your settings. But there's still a lot left to do. Read below to see how to proceed.

Adjusting your GPU settings

Now is the time to head into your game play around and see how performance has been affected. Bring up an in-game view of your fps and use the ALT + O keyboard shortcut to get an overlay of the Arc Control Telemetry. Now you're ready to experiment.

Step 1: Put your game through some graphically demanding scenes and see what happens. This is an involved process of making tweaks checking back on performance and fixing any issues that may crop up due to overheating as you slowly find out what levels your GPU can be overclocked to. The more you experiment with different settings the more you’ll learn how far you can push. Look for good signs like increased fps in more graphically demanding areas. Signs like graphical artifacts or crashing means that you’ve pushed too far in the wrong direction. Monitoring GPU temperature will also help you find out how its dealing with the latest changes you made.

Step 2: Again be careful with the GPU voltage offset setting which is the primary slider that can really harm or break your graphics card if it’s pushed recklessly high. Only go with tiny increments here and revert changes if your temperature spikes beyond set parameters - you don't want to see it going above 90 degrees Celsius too regularly. But overall don’t be too worried about crashing as you’re making adjustments as it’s a process.

Step 3: If you aren’t getting many results we suggest switching to a different game to see if there’s some noticeable improvement there from the last time you played. Again different games can react in different ways. Best of luck and don’t forget you can reset to default settings at any time to start over!

Having never been on skates before is a primary reason. That didn't stop Mugica a Spanish exchange student spending his senior year of high school at Portsmouth from wanting to be the team as a goalie.

The closest thing to ice hockey Mugica had experienced in his native country was roller skating.

""(Mugica) came to the first meeting and said he had played roller hockey in Spain and that he wanted to give goalie a try"" Portsmouth head coach Joel Brown said. ""He was just hoping to make the team and practice with us. And since he had never been on skates before ever I told him let's see how you can skate. If he could skate then we could have him practice with us but he was never get to play. I pretty much told him he wasn't playing.""

And Mugica's response?

""He said as long as he's able to practice and be part of the team then he (would be) fine with that"" Brown said.

""The first day I remember saying to coach 'I know I'm not going to play because there were two other goalies better than me and I had never played hockey before'"" Mugica said. ""And they told me 'You're not going to play obviously but you can go to practice.' That was my goal — to practice.""

Brown recalled Mugica's first practice in goal.

""From day one (Mugica) didn't know how to play net the equipment was brand new to him he had never skated before but he took shots"" Brown said. ""He went right to the net immediately on day one and people were firing shots at him and he was trying to save them.""

Soon those practice shots turned into game shots.

First game first win

Due to injuries to Portsmouth's top two goalies Mugica was the last man standing and it was time for him to make his varsity and ice hockey debut late in January against Goffstown.

""I was so nervous"" Mugica said. ""They told me (Goffstown) wasn't as good as other teams that we faced so I knew I had a chance to win that game. I started thinking about my glove motions and and my glove motions were good.""

Mugica said the first period went so well that when the second period rolled around he wasn't nervous at all.

Portsmouth entered the game on a six-game losing streak allowing roughly six goals a game. Goffstown entered the game with a record of 4-2-2 and averaged just under four goals a game.

Though it was Mugica's first time playing goal those numbers flipped as Mugica helped the ClipperMules snap their losing streak and skate off with a 2-1 win.

It was the fewest amount of goals allowed in the season up to that point for the ClipperMules and was the fewest amount of goals scored in a game for Goffstown.

""The entire team played very well but Nico was the star of the show"" Portsmouth junior forward Johnny Forrest said. ""He had multiple huge saves that kept us in the game. It was a low-scoring game so props go to (Nico).""

Ecstatic with his performance Mugica picked up the phone that night and called home.

""When we won I was so happy it was so good"" Mugica said. ""All the people from the school were there that was so nice. My host family was there. It was good for the team and good for me. I was also the MVP for my team. I called my parents to tell them that.""

Mugica added ""(My parents) were obviously happy and so proud of me. The next day all of my family like my uncles and aunts called me.""

""It was amazing"" Brown said of Mugica's performance. ""He made a lot of good saves. He was just so excited to be part of the team and to be in the net. The kids played well in front of him and that was part of it. They really wanted to do well for him and stop as many shots as they could.""

Locker room presence

As much of a treasure Mugica's presence has been on the ice Brown Forrest and the rest of the ClipperMules enjoy Mugica the person just as much.

""(Mugica) handles every situation with a smile and a laugh and he's just a really great personality ... he's always positive"" Brown said.

Forrest said Mugica just has a good vibe about him and is always happy and in the locker room Mugica will sometimes play the pregame music.

""He plays a lot of Spanish music and he's always dancing to the Spanish music and it gets us pumped up before a big period"" Forrest said. ""Everyone just loves to be with him he just has that certain type of energy.""

""I like it so much"" he said. ""The group is pretty good we have a pretty good team. And since the first day I've felt that I was part of the team and that's felt pretty good. And now that I am actually playing I can feel the experience of the rink.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvdXMvd2FsbC1zdC13ZWVrLWFoZWFkLXNpZ25zLW1hcmtldC1zdHJlbmd0aC1jaGVlci11cy1zdG9ja3MtYnVsbHMtMjAyMy0wMi0wNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Wall St Week Ahead Signs of market strength cheer U.S. stocks bulls,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 401 Client Error: HTTP Forbidden for url: https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/wall-st-week-ahead-signs-market-strength-cheer-us-stocks-bulls-2023-02-04/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldXRlcnMuY29tL21hcmtldHMvdXMvd2FsbC1zdC13ZWVrLWFoZWFkLXNpZ25zLW1hcmtldC1zdHJlbmd0aC1jaGVlci11cy1zdG9ja3MtYnVsbHMtMjAyMy0wMi0wNC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZW1pbHl3YXNoYnVybi8yMDIzLzAyLzAzL3doYXRzLWFuLWFjdGl2aXN0LWludmVzdG9yYW5kLWhvdy1kby10aGV5LWV4ZXJjaXNlLXNvLW11Y2gtY29udHJvbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's An Activist Investor–And How Do They Exercise So Much Control?,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Max restarts limit reached for url: https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywashburn/2023/02/03/whats-an-activist-investorand-how-do-they-exercise-so-much-control/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvZW1pbHl3YXNoYnVybi8yMDIzLzAyLzAzL3doYXRzLWFuLWFjdGl2aXN0LWludmVzdG9yYW5kLWhvdy1kby10aGV5LWV4ZXJjaXNlLXNvLW11Y2gtY29udHJvbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld21hcmtldHRvZGF5LmNhL2xvY2FsLXNwb3J0cy9jZW50cmFsLXlvcmstcGFudGhlcnMtaG9zdC1zaWx2ZXItc3RpY2staW4tYXVyb3JhLW5ld21hcmtldC02NDg2MzUy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Central York Panthers host Silver Stick in Aurora Newmarket,1 / 1 Central York Panthers U9 and U11 players exchange pins with the Montgomery Ice Devils at the kickoff of the 34th annual International Silver Stick tournament this weekend at local rinks in Newmarket and Aurora.

Jordan Name Healthy Hip Hop As The Winner Of Legacy Classic Startup ...,"After deliberating among the pitch competition’s four finalists the significance and timeliness of Healthy Hip Hop’s mission ultimately led it to receive this year’s crown.

“There were a lot of things the group liked about Healthy Hip Hop. First of all some of the VC participants have kids and so a culture-driven product for kids that is both entertaining and educational was something we’d want to use as consumers” Michael Palank General Partner at MaC Venture Capital shared exclusively with AfroTech. “2023 will also mark the 50th anniversary of Hip-Hop so we felt this was a good time for a company called Healthy Hip Hop to start to scale. At the end of the day building any kind of product for kids [and by association their parents] is hard. You have to create a safe environment with kid-friendly content. There are all kinds of necessary barriers to selling advertising on products that are made for kids and most kids aged 5-10 do not have their own phones so you first have to sell to their parents. Growth can be hard.”

“But Healthy Hip Hop is already being used by schools and parents alike” he continued. “Roy Scott the Founder and CEO is a Hip-Hop artist who wanted to positively influence his kids. When he realized that his own rap lyrics that his own kids were quoting were about violence drugs and disrespecting other people he knew he needed to find another path. We love his story and think his DNA as a Hip-Hop artist will serve the company well.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kYWlseW1haWwuY28udWsvdHZzaG93Yml6L2FydGljbGUtMTE3MTQ1MzkvTWljaGFlbC1CLUpvcmRhbi1zaXRzLWNvdXJ0c2lkZS0ybmQtSW52ZXNjby1RUVEtTGVnYWN5LUNsYXNzaWMtYmFza2V0YmFsbC1ldmVudC5odG1s0gGPAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5bWFpbC5jby51ay90dnNob3diaXovYXJ0aWNsZS0xMTcxNDUzOS9hbXAvTWljaGFlbC1CLUpvcmRhbi1zaXRzLWNvdXJ0c2lkZS0ybmQtSW52ZXNjby1RUVEtTGVnYWN5LUNsYXNzaWMtYmFza2V0YmFsbC1ldmVudC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Michael B.

Surrounded by tall and leafy beech trees and with views stretching over the rooftops of Cardiff and beyond life seems peaceful and serene here. But don't be fooled by this apparent tranquillity or the firmness of the ground.

For beneath your feet is perhaps Cardiff's best-kept secret: one of the biggest underground cave systems of any city in the UK. Within those caves are even more secrets some of which have occasionally been dragged to the surface like the murdered body of a woman or the calcified skeletons of cats. Others like a blacksmith's workshop still intact with all its tools in place and drowned by a subterranean lake will never see the light of day again.

There are clues if you know where to look. From the rust-stained nodules half-buried in the woodland debris to the now-disused ivy-clad quarry buildings scattered round the secrets of Cardiff’s hollow mountain are hiding in plain sight. They are the tiniest hints of what lies below: a labyrinth of uncharted tunnels hidden chasms bottomless pits subterranean lakes and collapsed roofs left over from years of mining.

Nature was the original miner in this network underneath the Garth mountain on the city's outskirts. But it was soon overpowered by the activity of man. The mountain is just one part of a soft and porous band of carboniferous limestone hills that marks the southern edge of the coalfield and Cardiff’s northern limits.

Over time the mountain has been ravaged by those keen to exploit the mineral riches beneath their feet. From Neolithic cave dwellers to the Iron Age Celts early Romans and fifth-century Welsh metal workers and right through to the 16th-century iron industry pioneers and the 19th-century Pentyrch Ironworks the mountain has been plundered for all its worth.

Even today the giant Mexican cement producer Cemex continues to work the Lesser Garth with the quarry works in Morganstown.

(Image: industrialgwent.co.uk) (Image: industrialgwent.co.uk) (Image: Peter Anning)

The steady march of modern-day quarrying has wrecked much of the Lesser Garth’s complex cave system. Yet the iron-working caverns in the Lesser Garth first opened up in 1565 and saved from destruction by a local campaign in the 1980s have survived with their own grisly tales to tell.

On November 2 1963 a group of boys exploring the iron workings mine ""looking for fossils"" made a gruesome discovery when they came across the body of a young woman at the base of a shaft alongside one of the upper caverns.

She had been strangled her body dumped into the shaft from some 200ft above. Identified as Cardiff Bay sex worker Patricia Simpson the case became one of the oldest unsolved murders for South Wales Police at the time.

Despite an extensive hunt her killer was never found and the case went cold until fresh evidence led detectives to Israel in the 1990s. A man by now in his 80s had spent 15 years languishing in an Israeli jail for a separate manslaughter before confessing to the murder in Wales.

Despite calls for him to be extradited to Britain for questioning he was never brought back to the UK after he was released a spokeswoman for South Wales Police told WalesOnline.

One of those who helped police search the caverns was film director Christopher Monger who grew up in Taff's Well and was familiar with the area.

Mr Monger thrust the Garth Mountain of his homeland into the global spotlight after directing the 1995 film The Englishman who Went up a Hill but Came down a Mountain adapted from a book written by his parents.

Now living in the United States Mr Monger can still recall just how vast the caves are: ""It really is hard to comprehend how enormous these caverns were. And at the next level down there were enormous lakes.

""The caves looked golden because the yellow ochre dust covered everything. It was astonishing. We loved going there until a murdered woman was dumped there. That stopped the good feeling.""

(Image: industrialgwent.co.uk) (Image: Christopher Monger)

People have always been entranced by the caverns even when it was a hive of activity with men and boys labouring in the dark. In the late 1800s it was not uncommon for visitors to take day trips to the pits by then owned by a TW Booker to watch them at work.

Giving a talk to the Cardiff Naturalist Society in 1872 a Mr FG Evans spoke of ""curious subterranean caverns"" at the site.

He said: ""The floor is usually coated with iron ore ochre of very good quality. The walls are lined with beautiful crystals from a speck to an inch in diameter.

""The mines amply repay the trouble of inspection. Visitors are conveyed through the tunnel in a covered carriage kept for that purpose and carry a lamp to enable them to examine the sides of the rock as they go.""

During his descent to the bottom of the mine Mr Evans noticed a blacksmith shop that looked as if it was ""suspended in mid-air"". Far below were the twinkling lights of the candles as the miners blasted the rocks.

Cave divers today say that very same blacksmith shop is still there intact with all its tools in place deep inside the now-flooded caverns. It's as if someone has pressed pause on this bygone era a silent snapshot of toil and industry left suspended in perpetuity.

While it is the jaw-dropping scale of the iron-working caverns which capture the attention the series of caves beyond have long attracted cavers to the area.

The Lesser Garth Cave hidden above the Tŷ Nant pub car park in Morganstown is home to the extremely rare white cave spider Porrhomma Rosenhaueri. Also known as Ogof Tynant it opens out into gigantic chambers and evidence suggests it has been used by humans for millennia.

The cave joins up to another Ogof Ffynnon Taf which is almost 400m in length and the largest cave system in the area. When it was first discovered by quarrymen in 1986 they found the skeleton remains of cats. Two were very old and one was ""cemented"" to the rock by natural calcification. The mystery of how and why cats found their way deep underground remains to this day.

The dripping water in these caves has created fascinating patterns over time. There are clusters of small fan-like curtains in the entrance and splendid stalactite pillars more than 20ft long. There are also crystal pools deeper within.

Standing amid the 114-acre beech woodland it's difficult to imagine just how much history is contained within one small mountain. Today the sound of hammers chipping away at rock below ground has been replaced by the low and constant hum of the M4 above ground.

The Italian clinched the men's 60m at his first meet of the year the Orlen Cup in Lodz Poland on Saturday (4 February) crossing the line in 6.57 seconds.

Jacobs who is the European record holder with a time of 6.41 had easily won his semi-final in 6.61 seconds before going faster in the final.

He was 0.03 seconds ahead of Poland's Dominik Kopec in the final with Trinidad and Tobago's Jerod Elcock (6.63) completing the top three.

Jacobs' next expected meet will the the Italian national indoor championships in two weeks with his sights set on the European Indoors in Istanbul Türkiye in March.

Meanwhile the Philippines' Ernest John Obiena won the men's pole vault ahead of a strong field which included two-time world outdoor champion and 2016 Olympic medallist Sam Kendricks.

Obiena was the only man to clear at 5.77m while Kendricks home favourite Piotr Lisek and Italy's Claudio Stecchi all passed at the height before missing three attempts at 5.82m.

Josh Jacobs joked that he felt unencumbered by the usual restraints of the standard NFL contract because he could be a free agent in a month.

Whether that was the case or he was just ready to get something off his chest he decided to go scorched earth on the league’s new Pro Bowl Games format Saturday.

“This (expletive) is stupid” he said during what was in theory a practice for Sunday’s flag football exhibition which will also feature a competition in which kickers play tic-tac-toe blindfolded long snappers try to launch grapes into the open mouth of the holder and linemen compete in a race to pull a weighted wall 10 yards.

Only one of those things is made up by the way. The other two are happening. You can figure that out for yourself.

Jacobs is one of the most honest and genuine professional athletes when it comes to expressing how he is feeling and he didn’t sugarcoat anything Saturday. He said while the event is billed as a rewarding getaway for excellence at their craft the players’ daily obligations make it anything but a vacation.

He’s not wrong. This whole thing is silly. But it is important to note that it was done in response at least in part to the continuous mockery of the old Pro Bowl format when players would often exert minimal effort with good reason. There’s no benefit to putting their bodies through the extra wear and tear of a full-contact football game during a week that is supposed to be a reward for a great season.

The new format is a work in progress.

“They need to figure out a way to make this make sense because I don’t enjoy this” Jacobs said. “We’re just kind of here. It’s not even really organized. They need to figure it out.”

There’s not an easy answer. While cynics and curmudgeons have complained about the Pro Bowl from the press box and through their columns for years fans watch it. So while Jacobs suggested the league simply reward players who make the Pro Bowl with a weeklong paid vacation the NFL isn’t going to give up a weekend of programming.

At least league officials are trying something and maybe players can take their frustrations this year and help craft a better experience for themselves and the fans in the future.

Maxx Crosby hopes so. The Raiders star is perhaps most responsible for the old format going away because he was so dominant last year by playing at half-speed when everyone else was stuck in neutral.

Crosby doesn’t figure to have near as much impact in a flag football game.

“I don’t even know if I can play in this game” he said. “Honestly I’ll just be hanging out. I think we have like tug of war or something for the big guys. I’ve been trying to convince (AFC coach Peyton Manning) to put me at tight end or something. We’ll see what happens next year. I hope we can play some football.”

Crosby competed in dodgeball Thursday though he was eliminated by Jacobs. He’s hoping to see different events implemented.

“I want to compete at something I’m a little better at because dodgeball is not my main sport so it was kind of a struggle” Crosby said. “But being around a bunch of players in the league and competing together is a lot of fun.”

That’s the bottom line. It’s supposed to be fun. And if you don’t like it there’s plenty of other viewing options.

The players do need to have a bigger voice though. This should be as much of a reward as possible not a chore.

Ref show

Once again the officials became the story in a major NFL event.

No this is not about the controversial conference championship games last weekend. This is about the dodgeball event Thursday.

New Orleans linebacker Demario Davis thought he had won a round for the NFC defense by eliminating Saquon Barkley only to have his celebration cut short. Barkley lobbied to any official who would listen that he was struck in the head with the ball which is illegal.

After discussion and a look at the replay his protest was granted and Barkley was declared the winner.

For what it’s worth the ultimate ruling was correct. But that’s never stopped anyone from complaining about NFL refs before so why start now?

The old-time image of an anarchist that has long been fixed in popular imagination is of a guy with wild hair and a deranged smile holding a circular bomb with a lit fuse. Alexander Berkman and Emma Goldman looked nothing like that. Photographs of them from more than a century ago show them to be quite proper and well dressed; they could have been any elegant couple decked out for a stroll along Fifth Avenue.

But Berkman and the better-known Goldman onetime lovers born in the Russian Empire were indeed anarchists believing in a society without leaders one rooted in an egalitarian spirit free of the top-down organization that has defined governance for oh only forever. Sure many anarchists were unruly: In their heyday roughly from 1880 to 1920 they went around blowing things up employing the dynamite invented by a Swedish gent Alfred Nobel whose name now graces the world’s most coveted peace prize.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMimAFodHRwczovL3d0b3AuY29tL2xvY2FsLXNwb3J0cy8yMDI0LzA1L2luY3JlZGlibHktc3BlY2lhbC1yYXJlLTE5MjAtamVyc2V5LXdvcm4tYnktd2FsdGVyLWpvaG5zb24td2hlbi10aGUtc2VuYXRvcnMtYmVhdC1iYWJlLXJ1dGgtaXMtbm93LXVwLWZvci1hdWN0aW9uL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘Incredibly special’: Rare 1920 jersey worn by Walter Johnson when the Senators beat Babe Ruth is now up for auction,"A piece of D.C. baseball history is up for sale and for sports memorabilia collectors its rarity is bringing up…

A piece of D.C. baseball history is up for sale and for sports memorabilia collectors its rarity is bringing up its value.

A game-worn jersey that belonged to Washington Senators pitcher and Baseball Hall of Famer Walter Johnson is currently at auction. Heritage House which is hosting the auction says the unique uniform is over a century old and valued at $3 million.

Production Manager Mike Provenzale told WTOP in the 20 years he’s worked for Heritage House Johnson’s jersey ranks at the top of all the items they’ve ever sold.

“It’s one of the most impressive items we’ve ever offered” he said calling the right-hander “one of the greatest sportsmen of all time.”

Using photo-matching the auction house traced the jersey back to April 29 1920 when the Washington Senators defeated the New York Yankees 2-1 at the Polo Grounds. It was the first time Johnson faced legendary hitter Babe Ruth. According to Provenzale Johnson earned his 299th career win while Ruth was only able to get a an RBI off a sacrifice fly.

“Through that photo-matching you’re able to identify the exact moment he was wearing it and when you can do that and it’s an important game with a lot of significant notes like that that just really piques the interest of high level collectors” he said.

This jersey was gifted by Johnson to teammate Eric “Swat” Erickson as a retirement gift after the 1920 season. Provenzale said Erickson brought a ranch in New York and had a barn where he kept all his sports collectibles including Johnson’s jersey.

“Decades later his granddaughter discovered it in the barn” Provenzale said adding that she was the one who initially sold it to a private seller.

Johnson’s legacy added an additional element that makes the jersey extremely valuable.

Known as “The Big Train” Johnson helped the Senators win its only World Series championship in 1924. He spent his entire 20-year playing career in Washington earning a record of 417-279 with a 2.17 ERA. For more than 50 years his 3509 strikeouts were the most thrown by a pitcher in the majors. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1936 prior to his death 10 years later.

“He was the most dominant pitcher. He holds numerous records. He has the most scoreless games the most consecutive years leading the league in strikeouts” Provenzale said. “Essentially it’s him and Cy Young who are considered … the greatest pitchers of all time.”

Unlike modern jerseys which teams and players hold on to due to their value at the time uniforms were not seen with much significance other than being work clothes. The fact that Johnson’s gift survived is “a miracle” Provenzale said.

“Jerseys in that era were considered disposable” he said. “They were worn and worn and repaired until they could no longer be repaired.”

There is only one other known jersey worn by Johnson that exists and it is sitting in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown New York. Combined with the disposable nature of uniforms in the past it is unlikely that another game-worn Johnson jersey will surface Provenzale said.

“So if you’re interested” he said. “This is the opportunity to get it”

Melody Felicano Johnson 40 pleaded guilty last month to two counts of poisoning food or drink for putting trace amounts of bleach into husband Roby Johnson’s coffee maker on July 11 and July 18 2023 Arizona’s 13 News reported.

Johnson was sentenced to a probation sentence that includes mandatory mental health treatment that goes into effect immediately and she is not allowed to have contact with her husband unless a legal team is present.

Roby Johnson said he believed his wife was trying to kill him to collect death benefits according to court documents.

She was initially arrested and charged with attempted first-degree murder aggravated assault and adding harmful substances to food drink or medicine but agreed to a plea deal instead.

The couple have a child together and were going through a divorce during the times she tried to poison her husband court documents show.

Roby began to notice his coffee tasted odd while he was drinking a cup in March 2023 when the family was stationed in Germany.

He drank the coffee for two or three weeks before purchasing pool testing strips to determine what was wrong with it.

First he tested the tap water which came back normal but after conducting the test on his coffee he discovered the drink contained high levels of chlorine.

He stated she knew that he would prep his coffee pot to be ready at night so that in the morning he just needed to turn it on to make his coffee.

Roby pretended to drink the coffee while stationed in Germany and waited until the family moved back to Tucson Arizona last summer to alert authorities because he did not want to report his findings in Europe the court documents state.

When the family returned to the US in late June Roby set up a camera inside their temporary housing near Davis Monthan Air Force Base to observe his wife’s behavior – and the camera allegedly captured Melody pouring bleach into his coffee.

On July 6 he filed a report with the Tucson Police Department but police did not follow up because the video did not clearly show what liquid his wife was pouring into his drink prompting Roby to set up a second camera disguised as a fire alarm.

Roby returned to the police department on July 18 to provide additional video evidence and the new footage allegedly showed his wife pouring bleach into the coffee machine before brewing. Johnson was then detained."

It is a small but busy place that is growing and has big ambitions. It is even used by members of the Royal Family when they visit the FA's HQ.

Dating back to 1941 flight enthusiasts and plane spotters are hugely passionate about the place - as are the people who work there. The airfield in Tatenhill has three runways all of which are paved but one is no longer operational and a second is used only occasionally. The main runway which runs from east to west is the longest.

At the helm of the airfield is the manager Anita Hall. Anita has been the manager for over two years. Before working at Tatenhill she used to work as a member of cabin crew for various airlines.

Anita who lives in Marchington Woodlands said that the main driver for the airfield is its flight school. The school started in the 1900 and allows people to learn how to fly light aircraft.

She said: ""We take all of our pilots through from right at the start to their private pilot's licence. We also have our private owners. People who can afford it have the luxury of their own aircraft stored here.

""We also to do our child's gift voucher flights where you get an hour or two up in an aircraft. We do a lot of thrill flights and taster sessions where you can take controls of aircraft.

""Our main challenge here is fixing any mechanical items that can go wrong. We have also had the issue of setting up the new cafe. We've done that completely from scratch but it has a wonderful view across the runway.""

She said that a lot of the people that come in are plane spotters as well as some celebrities and key public figures. She said the airfield also provides an essential service as the base for the Air Ambulance.

Anita added: ""We have lots of plane spotters who come down regularly. The Air Ambulance is based here too and people come from up and down to give donations and to look at the planes taking off. There's not much you can do for free nowadays but we are here anyone can come down and park up.

""That being said our flights are always full in fact we're fully booked up to May for our flights. We have regular customers and it sells itself really. We are a forever-growing business and it is a fantastic achievement for everyone.

""In our time we have had quite a few royals fly in. Prince William lands here when he goes to visit St George's Park just around the corner. Boris [Johnson] would always come into Tatenhill before he was de-throned. Not the footballers though they usually get coached up. When one of the Royals comes it all has to be kept very quiet. We're not allowed to tell anyone so it's nicer when they come and go although rumours sometimes get out.""

Given its location many have thought that the airfield may have to deal with challenges from both nearby East Midlands Airport (EMA) and next-door neighbours in its rural proximity. However Anita said that they have a good relationship with their neighbours and the major travel hub near Castle Donington is not a rival for them.

She added: ""EMA doesn't really pose a challenge. There are restrictions in place but there isn't really an effect. We're just outside their airspace so we are ok with where we are. It is quite busy in that direction but our pilots stay safe. We're yet to see a jet land here!

""It can be a tricky one when we take off for our neighbours but we don't fly on bank holidays to give our neighbours respect. We don't get too many complaints.

""Our future is to thrive and grow and to get bigger and bigger but at the same time we never have to look for customers. Everyone's friendly and we will always try to match the right customers to the right instructor. We take our time to give them the right match. I love coming to work.""

One of the pilots who use the airfield regularly is Matt Ball. Matt who works as a music producer said that he enjoys coming to Tatenhill. He said: ""I'm in and out of lots of different airfields. I like the vibe and accessibility this place poses. It's reasonably priced and is in a great location.

""There's an all-round nice atmosphere here. There are lots of people around and I love being here. I've done lots of work with celebrities and brought a guy from the Stereophonics here once. There are all sorts of people in and out all day. It's a lovely place to be.""

(Image: StaffordshireLive)

There are currently multiple projects going on at the airfield including the construction of a new building and flight deck. There is also restoration work going on an old World War Two bunker. The person at the helm of the bunker restoration is Andy Selby. He said: ""The bunker dates back to 1942 to 1944-ish. There was one long bench along the side with radio equipment in case of an air raid. Our aim is to recreate the bunker as it was.

""We have been working here for six months and there was a lot of rubbish and graffiti on the walls. We have filled the holes in and repainted it. We want to be somewhere we can take people down to show a bunker.""

Some of the other notable things on-site include a 1950 Buccaneer plane as well as an original Second World War aircraft hanger. Anita said: ""We have repainted the Buccaneer in desert colours. Our enthusiasts love it. It is a passion project for one of our team - Lee Parker. It won't fly but the engine runs.

(Image: StaffordshireLive)

""We are investing in our future. Our new building will have a new restaurant but at the moment we have now opened a new cafe. From February it will be open seven days a week.

""Every day is different. I love the vibes here and everybody is really nice. We love it here.""

פרסום ראשון - בצעד חריג נתניהו ביקש מרון דרמר מקורבו להיות זה שיקיים שיחות עם בתי ההשקעות וסוכנויות הדירוג בעניין הרפורמה המשפטית. בשגרה מי שמנהלים את השיחות הם אנשי האוצר ולא דרג פוליטי. — עמליה דואק (@AmalyaDuek) February 4 2023

“In an unusual move Netanyahu asked his associate Ron Dermer to be the one to hold talks with the investment houses and the rating agencies regarding the legal reform” Duek wrote adding that “Normally the people who manage [such] talks are Finance Ministry people and not the political echelon.”

On Friday American finance organization JPMorgan issued a report specifying the risk posed by investment in Israel in light of the judicial reform and increased geopolitical tension within the country.

What are the reports saying?

According to reports from the Kan public broadcaster Netanyahu personally contacted senior leaders within the firm in an effort to prevent the report’s release. Earlier in the week the PM had suggested that JPMorgan’s lack of concern regarding the judicial reforms was evidence that they would not tank Israel’s reputation among investors.

Per Kan’s report Netanyahu also spoke with several international credit ratings firms in order to downplay the expected negative impact that experts have stated the legal overhaul will have.

On Saturday former Bank of Israel chief and recent JPMorgan Chase International chairperson Jacob Frenkel criticized Netanyahu’s negligence in heeding the concerns of experts and economic leaders who have repeatedly expressed how damaging the judicial reforms could be to Israel’s economy particularly in relation to its reputation among foreign investors.

“I’m very surprised” he told Channel 12 news. “When JPMorgan makes a recommendation — take it very seriously… Countries that have weakened their judicial oversight are the countries where the citizens have suffered.”

“This is not the time for panic. This is the time to demand that the [warning] opinions be heeded. This is not how you carry out a reform” Frenkel added. “Netanyahu and I carried out a reform of Israel’s foreign currency market. It was done gradually with fieldwork transparency and a process. Not deep fast now! What is this?”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9jaGFybG90dGUvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzAyLzA0L2JhYy1jdXRzLW1veW5paGFuLXBheS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bank of America cuts CEO Brian Moynihan's pay - Charlotte Business Journal,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.bizjournals.com/charlotte/news/2023/02/04/bac-cuts-moynihan-pay.html on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJpempvdXJuYWxzLmNvbS9jaGFybG90dGUvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzAyLzA0L2JhYy1jdXRzLW1veW5paGFuLXBheS5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vdHJ1dGhvdXQub3JnL2FydGljbGVzL21hc3NpdmUtaW5lcXVhbGl0eS1pcy1hLWNvbmNlcnRlZC1lbGl0ZS1jbGFzcy1wcm9qZWN0LXNheXMtaGVhdGhlci1nYXV0bmV5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Massive Inequality Is a “Concerted Elite Class Project” Says Heather Gautney,"In 1956 the famed sociologist C. Wright Mills published The Power Elite a blistering critique of concentrated political economic and military power in the United States. The book influenced many protest movements of the 1960s and has inspired radical scholars and activists ever since.

Now in 2023 Heather Gautney is continuing Mills’s project of analyzing and mapping out elite power in the U.S. In her new book The New Power Elite she offers a wide-ranging and urgent analysis of entrenched corporate power in the U.S. today. From Wall Street to Big Tech from billionaires to celebrities Gautney maps out the composition of today’s power elite and its methods of exploiting poor and working people to extract evermore wealth and profit.

The New Power Elite is a must-read for anyone interested in understanding and challenging elite power today and creating a more just and democratic society that prioritizes human needs over corporate profits.

Gautney is a professor of sociology at Fordham University. She has published numerous books and articles on U.S. politics and social movements including Protest and Organization in the Alternative Globalization Era: NGOs Social Movements and Political Parties and Crashing the Party: From the Bernie Sanders Campaign to a Progressive Movement. She served as a senior policy adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders on his 2020 presidential campaign and in the U.S. Senate Budget Committee and she co-chaired the Biden-Sanders Taskforce on Education in 2020.

In this exclusive interview with Truthout Gautney discusses how both Democrats and Republicans allied with corporate elites to create today’s neoliberal order and its concerted project of elite class rule the dangers of ignoring the working class and how we might organize toward a more egalitarian order.

Derek Seidman: The Power Elite by C. Wright Mills was published in 1956. You write that your book is “a continuation of Mills’ program” to understand the nature of elite power. Why did you feel that it was important in our current moment to write this book?

Heather Gautney: First I was a graduate assistant of Stanley Aronowitz who was a Mills scholar. I had read The Power Elite and other works by Mills and I was always excited about him and interested in crafting language and critiques that would appeal beyond the ivory tower of academia. Stanley was that kind of public intellectual and he brought me up in that lineage.

The other thing was that for most of my “academic career” I was an activist in the global justice movement against free trade agreements and other aspects of neoliberal capitalism. I wrote my first book on that. I got to this point where I knew what I was against but I didn’t have a firm understanding of exactly who the people were that I was protesting. So that was a motivation to write this book — a desire to see the other side of it.

That also brought me to apply for a fellowship in Congress to try to situate myself in government where people are making these kinds of consequential decisions. I applied for a fellowship and I ended up working for Bernie Sanders. You really get a sense of the power structures when you work for him because he is contesting them like no one else is. That gave me a particular vantage point — to sort of be on the inside but not be of the inside.

In terms of why I wrote this book now Mills beckoned his readers to perform the same kind of analysis he performed in The Power Elite for their moment. The idea was that I and others would do this for our time. That’s a lineage that Mills left.

In your book you talk about the “concerted class program” of corporate elites and how it has shaped the rise of today’s political and economic order. Can you say a little bit about what you mean by this?

I wanted to emphasize this because a feature of neoliberalism is that it poses as ahistorical. It hides its tracks. It presents capitalism as the best possible system while degrading other systems. So for me it’s really important to show that the political and social inequalities that we have today are by design. They didn’t happen by accident.

For example there’s a lot of commentary about how the Koch brothers played the long game and how smart the right wing has been. But it leaves out the role of the Democrats in the neoliberal class project. The reality is that the Democratic Party at a particular time — really in the lead up to Bill Clinton — made a decision that they were going to sever ties with workers and build ties with corporations. They even had the Koch brothers on the Democratic Leadership Council’s executive council. That’s how flagrant it was.

That was a political decision to try to out-GOP the GOP but it was also a class decision to side with corporate interests and against workers’ interests. Clinton came out of the gate with the North American Free Trade Agreement. He pushed for welfare reform. He deregulated the financial industries and telecommunications — all of these things that we’re paying the price for now but which have been hugely profitable for Big Tech and Wall Street. This wasn’t an accident. And the class perspective — the idea that this was a concerted elite class project — has really been pushed aside.

We also tend to look at the billionaire class and make a distinction between say George Soros and the Koch brothers. But what I try to show in the book is that corporate elites and those who serve them do share common interests on many fundamental things.

In Jeffrey Winters’s book Oligarchy he talks about “wealth defense” — this confluence of interests among the very rich on particular policy issues like taxation or maintaining a low minimum wage. Bill Gates is supposed to be some wonderful progressive philanthropist but talk to him about trade unions or investment in the public sector and he starts to sound a heck of a lot like Charles Koch.

And it’s not just that the rich are rich. Another goal of my book was to emphasize the social relationships undergirding elite power — the ideas methodologies and technologies they’ve imposed on people to get rich and how destructive and horrific they are. There’s a fundamental class program at work in the making of the gross inequality we have today — and at its core is the social relationship of exploitation.

The rise of neoliberalism is a core theme of your book. You emphasize how the neoliberal order has atomized people and weakened social solidarity.

Neoliberals say that they are promoting a system that safeguards individual liberty. But in reality it’s a system that promotes the primacy of profit-making against the collective or public good. That’s why neoliberals call any public spending “collectivist” in a pejorative way.

We see this play out in the school system. In their view public schools are an impingement on human freedom because they require parents to pay into a system that they say forces them to enroll their children in supposedly subpar schools. Never mind that public schools perform the same or better than many private schools. So they promote “liberalizing” education so that parents have a “choice.” But what they really want to do is privatize education and turn it into a profitable industry. The whole charter school movement was about this. Everybody goes to school right? It’s a gigantic field for profiteering.

Also they seek to undermine public education because they know that public schools are spaces where people learn things like civic engagement tolerance and critique. They know that people can be empowered in these spaces.

Within this construct of “protecting individual liberty” the federal government — when acting as an agent of public spending and human and environment protection — becomes the bad guy because it’s imposing a supposedly collectivist way of life on people. It’s a view of freedom as deriving from individual sovereignty and competition as opposed to the idea of a common good — the idea that we can have an institutional system that we all share in and build together that’s not commodified or produced through relations of exploitation.

And obviously there’s a direct relationship between the corruption of the public school system and many Americans’ lack of ability to discern between truthful reporting and conspiracy theories and disinformation. If you have an uneducated public and an atomized population you have the ability to manipulate on a mass scale. I believe that was by design. Today a small number of people wield more control over the means of communication than any dictator has in history. Think about that.

The ultra-right lurch and pro-corporate agenda of Republicans is no secret to most but you really emphasize the central role the Democratic Party has played in consolidating and promoting the neoliberal corporate order. Can you explain more?

I try to show that the Republican and Democratic parties basically operate as a political establishment based on a general consensus around the neoliberal economic order — divesting from public institutions and privatizing them giving corporations the freest hand possible disabling working-class institutions like unions and so on. I try to demonstrate that Democrats have participated in creating and sustaining this order as much as the Republicans have.

Republicans obviously swing much further to the right and are not afraid to be autocratic. Democrats are more technocratic. It wasn’t that long ago that Joe Biden was on the Senate floor talking about how we have to reduce Social Security and Medicare because we can’t increase the deficit. Barack Obama tried to cut Social Security by manipulating Consumer Price Index calculations. He and other Democrats have used the federal budget and fiscal austerity as an excuse to disable social programs that working people rely on.

If you don’t have a political force that’s going to get in the way of the Republican Party then the political horizon is going to shift to the right. And that’s exactly what happened. When the Democrats decided to be the party of Walmart and Wall Street you didn’t have any progressive wing to anchor the kind of New Deal paradigm that had been shaping U.S. politics and the political economic structure.

That’s where I think Bernie was incredibly impactful. He came along in 2016 and demonstrated that a lot of people were open to the word “socialism.” He resurrected that New Deal wing. And I think he exposed the Democrats more than anyone.

This was the benefit of working in the Senate with him and working on his campaigns. You see this stuff up really close. You’re painfully aware of the fact that if you have a progressive viewpoint that because of the money and corporate interests in politics you are up against a Goliath.

I had an interesting experience during my first year working for Bernie in 2013. The Farm Bill was up and Bernie had submitted a handful of amendments. One of them was genetically modified organisms (GMO) labeling. Everybody — at least in Vermont — wants to know if there are genetically modified organisms in their food. Not one Democrat voted for it. No one. I went back and I looked at the campaign contributions for members of the Senate. All of them were getting money from Monsanto. So of course they weren’t going to vote for GMO labeling because that would have screwed over the company that was giving them a couple thousand dollars for their next campaign. It was so flagrant.

That was like a kind of a “come-to-Jesus” moment for me. It was like “Oh this is how it works. They don’t even want us to know what’s in our food.” The Democrats would rather side with this horrible corporation than with everyday people. We saw this with a host of other stuff — Democrats trying to block Bernie from lowering the cost of prescription drugs because they were all getting money from Big Pharma. It was and is an utter disgrace.

You have a whole chapter on Wall Street. What are some ways that Wall Street preserves elite class rule today and dominates poor and working people?

One criticism of Mills was that he didn’t adequately account for the rise of finance capital. That was in the 1950s. Now we can’t ignore it — it’s the fundamental matrix of the global economy.

I attacked the problem of Wall Street from a couple of different perspectives. The first was coming from the analysis in Randy Martin’s book The Financialization of Everyday Life. I looked at the ways in which debt is used as a mechanism of social control and extraction of value from everyday people — student debt credit card debt housing debt predatory lending with payday loans and car loans. It’s banks targeting poor people trying to extract wealth from people who don’t have anything.

Another piece of it was how Wall Street was able to game the housing market making risky bets and essentially treating the global economy like a casino. Time and time again Wall Street has been able to “externalize risk” onto everyday people abetted by politicians on their payroll who are all too happy to issue huge bank bailouts then impose budget cuts to make up for losses.

Then you have private equity firms buying up whole sectors like the rental housing market. They started doing it in the shadow of the housing market crash because people lost their homes and they were able to buy up cheap homes. Now they have these huge rental companies where they make incredible amounts of money renting to people price-gouging them.

They’ve done the same in health care. I wrote about this in the book because I was extremely alarmed by it — that private equity firms are buying up hospitals and “re-engineering” them. They’re closing hospitals even in rural areas which is frightening because rural communities rely on these hospitals. If your hospital closes down you might be two hours away from another one. If you have a heart attack and a private equity firm closes your local hospital because it’s not “profitable” you’re just going to die. They don’t care. It’s not about serving the health care needs of the country. It’s about what’s best for these private equity firms and their profit margins.

We should be turning on MSNBC and seeing reports on this every day because it’s absolutely consequential. But instead it’s Donald Trump and more Donald Trump.

You argue that celebrities are part of the new power elite in a way they weren’t when Mills wrote his book. Can you talk about this in the context of Trump?

In my book I talk about the role of entertainment in politics. If you look at some of the darkest periods in human history and the rise of dictatorships they were all very charismatic leaders. They used entertainment and music and all of these trappings of amusement to bring people in.

Trump really had that skill. He had a dimension of humor. He was very skillful at presenting himself as the “everyman” as well as the ideal man. To his followers he was the billionaire with a big airplane and beautiful wife the “American Dream” personified — but also one of you. These are the features that Theodor Adorno identified in his analysis of German fascism. I’m not equating the U.S. with that historical moment but the tactics were all there and remain there.

Much of this is possible not just because of political disaffection but because of the primacy of entertainment in our culture. Celebrities now have corporate cultural and political power. They have that power because publicity branding and advertising have become major means of public engagement in our society today all enabled by communications technologies and social media.

Trump is made possible by this confluence of political factors but also cultural factors. I’m not the only person to point out that “The Apprentice” was very popular. He’s painted as this big executive in the show and it rated very highly early on. Everyone got to know Trump. And it brought him a certain kind of publicity that translated into political power. We’re seeing more of that now. Look at Dr. Mehmet Oz and Herschel Walker. They didn’t ultimately win but they won their primaries. And the general elections were close especially in Georgia. The fact that Walker came that close to winning says something about celebrity in politics. That’s how we live with celebrity now. We don’t have that relationship with politicians and we don’t trust politicians in this country but we love and adore celebrities.

We don’t have a Democratic Party that is interested in representing the interests of working-class people. That’s how I think Trump is possible. And that’s how Ron DeSantis becomes possible.

Are there any cracks or fissures that you see in the class rule of the new power elite? And what should organizers do today to mount a stronger challenge to the current order?

I outlined a few areas at the end of the book that I think are fertile for progressive efforts to diffuse elite power and work toward a more egalitarian order. One of them is the media. Quite frankly I’m disgusted by the corporate media. I think it’s really important that we support and engage in all kinds of independent media. Truthout is an example — Truthout is great. Adolph Reed has this incredible online project called Nonsite. Without these outlets we’d be missing something really important. We have these centers of information and commentary and we need more of them.

We also have to center the concept of public goods in our political life. That’s been the primary frontier of the political establishment’s attack on working-class and poor people. I think that’s a really concrete policy-driven space that people from all kinds of political backgrounds can focus on. Even people who are manipulated by the right believe in the importance of Social Security and Medicare. I think Bernie was really good at this.

Finally I think as a movement we need to get out of our silos. There’s this fragmentation of movements. I really wanted my book to say to people: Elite power is so concentrated and so deep and so ruthless and violent that there’s no way that one movement over here or over there is going to be able to take on all of these forces. This kind of siloing has to stop. I really believe that people need to get out of their comfort zones and do what Jane McAlevey called “organizing” as opposed to just mobilizing. Labor unions are really good at this. They’re willing to go beyond the converted. We need more institutions like that.

Until we have a real understanding as movements of the fundamental relation of capitalism undergirding all of our struggles then I don’t think anything’s going to happen. In fact it will just get worse.

KVUE,Kenvue,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzAyLzA1LzItcmVhc29ucy10by1idXktam9obnNvbi1qb2huc29uLTItcmVhc29uLXRvLXNlbGwv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2 Reasons to Buy Johnson & Johnson and 2 Reasons to Sell,"If you're interested in a passive income stock it's among the most reliable.

There are plenty of reasons why many investors enjoy holding shares in Johnson & Johnson (JNJ 0.51%) one of the world's largest healthcare businesses. With the company's impressive track record of dividend payments and its pipeline's massive throughput of new medicines it's clear that this stock will be around for the foreseeable future.

But even if it's a stalwart for many portfolios it isn't perfect. Let's examine two major reasons that make the stock worth purchasing and two reasons that might make it better to sell or avoid.

1. Its business is remarkably resistant to inflation

Johnson & Johnson's product mix makes it worth buying in times like now when inflation is higher than average. Some of its core offerings are branded consumer health goods like Tylenol and Band-Aids for which there's well-established and highly durable demand. Even when the economy is showing signs of struggling mightily as during the fourth quarter of 2022 its consumer health segment still grew by 1% on a reported basis reaching more than $3.7 billion.

That means investors can have a measure of confidence in the business's ability to survive hard times. After all its products are in everyday use for huge swaths of the population and its brands are often so strong that they've been household names for decades. Brands serve as a competitive advantage as they help to protect market share against encroachment from competitors.

Johnson & Johnson will be spinning off its consumer health business into a new entity called Kenvue sometime this year. However investors who buy shares before the spinoff will get shares of the new company as well as the older entity that'll retain the J&J name. Even afterward its offerings of pharmaceutical medicines and medical devices should be fairly inflation-resistant as the new business can often hike prices to keep its margins static if input costs rise unexpectedly.

2. A long history of rewarding shareholders

Johnson & Johnson is a great stock for most investors because it has a strong history of rewarding shareholders for their contribution of capital.

It pays a dividend with a forward yield today of roughly 2.7% and it also does regular share buybacks; over the last 10 years the company repurchased an average of $1.4 billion worth of its shares per quarter. What's more the company just hiked its dividend for the 60th consecutive year and management expects to continue with those hikes even after J&J spins off its consumer health division.

Over long holding periods the constant drumbeat of dividend hikes and share repurchases can pay off big. In the last 20 years J&J's total return rose by 433% while its payout grew by 451%. That means if you're patient you can build a small income stream from your shares -- or use a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) to gradually build up a much larger position.

Now let's examine a pair of reasons to sell or avoid this stock.

1. The talc powder settlements are looming

One decent reason to sell Johnson & Johnson stock today is that its innovative plan to resolve paying out legal settlements has foundered likely leaving it on the hook for potentially billions of dollars in restitution payments. In case you're not familiar approximately 40000 lawsuits have been filed against the company alleging that its baby powder products cause cancer.

J&J sought to create a subsidiary that would accept the liability and then enter into bankruptcy. But on Feb. 1 the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals put a kibosh on that plan so now it looks like the legal battles will continue on for quite a bit longer which should be a concern for shareholders.

2. Slow growth

J&J's anticipated pace of slow growth is another decent reason to consider selling your shares. Even counting the impact of reinvesting dividends and benefiting from dividend hikes and share repurchases over the last 20 years the stock still didn't outperform the market which had a total return of nearly 580%.

There's little reason to expect J&J's growth rate to change dramatically though the spinoff should boost top-line expansion by a bit.

But the issue isn't that the company's growth strategy is sub-optimal. It's simply very difficult to continue growing a business when the top line starts to push $98 billion as management predicts it will in 2023. Reaching growth even in high single-digit percentages requires it to bring in billions and billions more each year.

Even with J&J's massive drug development pipeline churning out new medicines onto the market after getting regulatory approval it's hard to make enough money to expand at the same pace as a smaller business just starting to penetrate its markets. So if you're looking for a quick buck from an investment this isn't the best stock for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Indonesia is not the world’s largest exporter of coffee but its coffee industry is nothing to scoff at when it employs millions of coffee farmers annually. Coffee farming is a profitable industry in Indonesia. The Asian nation has an ideal climate for coffee bean growth and has had incredible coffee output averaging the production of more than 600000 tons of coffee or 4 million bags. International aid organizations are beginning new initiatives and investments to solidify economic stability decrease poverty rates and end gender disparities.

Indonesia’s Gender Disparities and Poverty

Indonesia is notorious for its patriarchal attitudes and the U.N. has ranked Indonesia 85th out of 149 countries for its gender wage gaps. Its ranking is among the highest of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) with women earning less than 60% of their male counterparts despite often having the same levels of education.

Indonesia has widespread economic gender disparities which could make women more likely to live in or fall into poverty than the male population. Data from the Central Statistics Agency recorded that in March 2022 at least 9% of Indonesia’s population lives in poverty. To combat the poverty rates that put women at a disadvantage in comparison to Indonesian men women are seeking out jobs in sectors with greater chances for a steady and reliable income mainly in agriculture.

According to a Springer Journal study women lack access to training for sustainable farming practices marketing and managing businesses connected to the agricultural sector. However crop yields and production would likely increase by 2.5-4% if women were to integrate into the agricultural workforce. By 2018 49% of Indonesia’s agricultural workforce consisted of women. Without them agricultural stability would decrease with the rural economy losing significant income and poverty rates increasing.

Indonesian Coffee Farming Practices

Agriculture is one of Indonesia’s three dominant business sectors. In 2021 it was responsible for 13% of the nation’s GDP. Agriculture has historically been one of the primary sources of income for Indonesians. Indonesia’s agriculture sector is a crucial global producer with coffee as one of its critical exports. Since the 1960s Indonesian coffee farming has steadily grown and expanded to offer more and more job opportunities for farmers nationwide.

Indonesian coffee farming occurs mainly on small shareholder farms. Small shareholder farms are beneficial as they safely sustain the economy of the rural populations help with expanding markets and protect natural resources. Protecting natural resources is especially helpful as Indonesia relies on its agricultural systems.

This farming practice involves renting or not owning a great deal of land on which the coffee is grown. Coffee plantations cover 1.24 million hectares and small-shareholder farmers operate more than 90% of Indonesia’s coffee farming land according to Indonesia Investments. Each farmer works on only one to two hectares. The small sizes of the farms might not seem impressive but the reliability of the farms entices investors worldwide. Indonesia’s government works to revitalize the land at any sign of slowing output and international aid organizations work to keep Indonesian coffee farming a viable option for jobs especially as women take more jobs in the sector to end the wage gaps.

Female Coffee Farmers Taking Indonesia By Storm

Women are integrating into the coffee workforce at an incredible rate and are working as small shareholder farmers. Even though female farmers lack formal training in some regions of Indonesia they are 80% of the coffee farming workforce. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) began working with Indonesia’s female coffee farmers to train them to improve their productivity and increase their income. Working on a flexible schedule the IFC trained 1600 women and helped open new loan businesses that cater to Indonesia’s coffee farming needs. The number of female coffee farmers trained rose to 27% up from 16% and productivity and income improved by 92% on average. Helping female coffee farmers improve their productivity and market profitability will bring them new economic opportunities to lift them out of poverty and improve local economies.

USAID announced its new program Indonesia Coffee Enterprise Resilience Initiative (Resilient Coffee). The program creates partnerships with Keurig Dr. Pepper and Root Capital a U.S.-based non-government organization. The program intends to provide credit for Indonesia’s rural agricultural businesses. USAID Indonesia Mission Director Jeff Cohen stated that the program “expand[s] public-private capacity and commitment to strengthening and increasing inclusive economic growth as well as prioritizing investment in women’s economic empowerment.” USAID’s new program will expand Indonesian coffee farming’s economic opportunities and “invest in women’s economic empowerment.” Empowering female coffee farmers will help end the gender wage gap and poverty struggles while bringing new economic opportunities to the region that benefit all involved.

If you truly enjoy navigating the aisles waiting in line and trying not to bump into someone with your cart that's commendable. Not to mention lately it's borderline painful at the register as inflation continues to drive food prices up and up. If you're a Kroger shopper however there's a light at the end of the tunnel: Experts say there are a few days that can help you avoid the hustle and bustle—and save some cash while doing so. Read on to find out the two best days to shop at Kroger.

One weekday reigns supreme.

As The Daily Meal first reported there are two specific days to get your grocery shopping done at Kroger. The first is ""hump day."" As Julie Ramhold consumer analyst with DealNews.com points out Kroger releases new ads on Wednesdays.

""This means that's when new sales kick in so it's a good time to take advantage of those"" Ramhold tells Best Life highlighting that Wednesday is also unique since it's in the middle of the week. ""Many people do their shopping for the upcoming week on Sundays so not only will you get the first pick of the newest sales by shopping on Wednesday you'll also potentially be able to avoid crowds.""

If you plan to switch to Wednesday Kroger trips there is one key detail to keep in mind The Daily Meal points out. Kroger's new weekly ad is available at midnight on Wednesday for those on Eastern Time (ET). But for those in Indiana (excluding Southeast Indiana and Evansville) Illinois and Eastern Missouri you have to wait until midnight on Thursday for the weekly ad according to Kroger's website.

Friday is another ideal shopping day.

When planning your next shopping excursion consider heading in on a Friday—even if you have to go after the workday's done. ""Kroger has 'Free Friday' promotions where shoppers can download a coupon for a free item"" Ramhold explains. ""The product will vary but it's always good to check to see what it's for and if you're interested in order to get a freebie.""

Ramhold adds that weekend sales are another plus as they start on Friday—meaning you can avoid the weekend craziness. ""It's worth checking out their promotions page to see what kinds of offers are on tap if you're thinking of shopping on Friday she says.

Ramhold says Mondays might be a good alternative too.

Going to Kroger during the standard workweek is your best bet according to Ramhold. ""Most people aren't interested in doing their big shopping then or don't have the time.""

Depending on where you live Mondays may be another good choice she says. But in general avoid the weekend days.

""I'd say Saturdays and Sundays are probably the worst time to shop especially if you're in an area where people may be purchasing items for tailgating or something like that as the stores tend to get very crowded with shoppers looking for snacks and drinks for their game day parties"" Ramhold says.

Consider other tips and tricks for shopping at Kroger.

In addition to shifting your shopping schedule Ramhold offers a few other suggestions to optimize your Kroger trip.

""If you're looking to save in general it's a good idea to sign up for a free Kroger Plus account so that you can receive and redeem digital coupons and earn things like points whenever you shop"" she explains. ""The big draw of the loyalty program is the personalized and exclusive savings you'll receive based on purchases you make. This can really help to cut back on your regular go-tos and make your grocery budget easier to stick to.""

Even though we're in the digital age Ramhold also notes that hardcopy coupons are still valuable. Some can even be used up to five times on items like tortilla chips sour cream and even Ben & Jerry's ice cream. ""If you're planning to be a regular shopper at Kroger it's absolutely worth looking out for these specific coupons to make your dollar stretch even further"" she notes.

Lastly she recommends downloading the Kroger app which you can use for no-contact payment to scan your loyalty card or track your delivery or pickup order. ""Instead of doomscrolling at night you can open up the Kroger app and browse current savings instead—and plan your next shopping trip with ease"" Ramhold says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzczMTYwOTEva3JvZ2VyLWJlc3QtZGF5cy1kZWFscy1hbmQtcHJvbW90aW9ucy_SAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS9tb25leS83MzE2MDkxL2tyb2dlci1iZXN0LWRheXMtZGVhbHMtYW5kLXByb21vdGlvbnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I’m a shopping expert – there are two days to visit Kroger for the best deals and promotions...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.the-sun.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /money/7316091/kroger-best-days-deals-and-promotions/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025626703640>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZS1zdW4uY29tL21vbmV5LzczMTYwOTEva3JvZ2VyLWJlc3QtZGF5cy1kZWFscy1hbmQtcHJvbW90aW9ucy_SAVBodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGUtc3VuLmNvbS9tb25leS83MzE2MDkxL2tyb2dlci1iZXN0LWRheXMtZGVhbHMtYW5kLXByb21vdGlvbnMvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9uYXNjYXIvbmV3cy1uYXNjYXItdGVhbS1qdGctZGF1Z2hlcnR5LXNlY3VyZXMtaHVnZS1saXN0LXNwb25zb3JzLTIwMjMtY3VwLXNlcmllcy1zZWFzb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NASCAR team JTG Daugherty secures huge list of sponsors for 2023 Cup Series season,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNwb3J0c2tlZWRhLmNvbS9uYXNjYXIvbmV3cy1uYXNjYXItdGVhbS1qdGctZGF1Z2hlcnR5LXNlY3VyZXMtaHVnZS1saXN0LXNwb25zb3JzLTIwMjMtY3VwLXNlcmllcy1zZWFzb27SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025626701990>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

KROGER is under fire after shoppers filed a formal lawsuit against the retail chain to prevent its upcoming merger with a rival company.

On February 2 customers from across the country issued a private lawsuit against Kroger in California.

The group intends to prevent the retailer from its planned $25 billion takeover of Albertsons.

Several states' attorney generals United States lawmakers and consumer groups believe that the merger would be ""harmful"" to grocery market competition per U.S. News & World Report.

The lawsuit is said to have come directly from 25 consumers across California Texas and Florida.

They claimed that Kroger's acquisition of its rival ""will be used to increase prices for groceries decrease the quality of food eliminate jobs close stores and offer less choice for consumers.""

This viewpoint from the 25 consumers likely comes from statistics surrounding Kroger and Albertsons' positions in the grocery market.

Kroger is reportedly the biggest grocery store chain in the country by revenue and Albertsons is close behind in second.

Because of this a merger would mean that around 5000 grocery store locations would be run by one company according to U.S. News & World Report.

In defense of this Kroger and Albertsons' said around the time of the merger's announcement in October 2022 that it will supposedly provide a ""more efficient distribution chain.""

The companies also claimed to have been working with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission for a ""regulatory review.""

Nevertheless the private lawsuit from February 2 is the first to come in opposition to the proposed deal.

The 25 consumers were allowed to issue a private lawsuit against Kroger due to U.S. antitrust law.

Some law experts have also said that they see validity in the claim from the consumers.

Joseph Alioto the Plaintiffs' lawyer out of San Francisco said that ""there's no question that Albertsons is a significant rival"" of Kroger.

""It's competition that they are eliminating"" he told U.S. News & World Report.

COMBATING INFLATION

Before the lawsuit Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen explained that the merger with Albertsons was taken on with the intention to lower prices for customers.

Speaking at NRF 2023: Retail's Big Show in New York City in January McMullen said that he understood Kroger consumers'' struggle with inflation.

""About half of our customers are under a lot of strain from a financial perspective — their wages haven't kept up with the inflation they've incurred"" he explained.

The goal is to reduce the costs of products in its stores to create more competition with other retail giants like Walmart and Target.

McMullen argued that by merging both companies could cut prices on their inventory per Reuters.

COMMUNITY CONCERN

As The U.S. Sun previously reported this still bothered some experts.

Stacy Mitchell the co-executive director of the Institute for Local Self-Reliance a non-profit that helps communities attract grocery stores and other businesses is fearful of the agreement.

""This merger is incredibly dangerous"" she noted.

“It’s highly likely if it goes through it will result in more communities not having a grocery store.”

Christine Bartholomew a law professor at the University of Buffalo also noted her hesitance about the merger.

“I’m deeply concerned about the consumer choice aspects of this” Bartholomew said.

“It may not sound like a big deal but private labels are among the most affordable brands.”

These thoughts were further echoed by United States senators like Bernie Sanders.

""At a time when food prices are soaring as a result of corporate greed it would be an absolute disaster to allow Kroger the 2nd largest grocery store in America to merge with Albertsons the 4th largest grocery store in America. The Biden Administration must reject this deal” he wrote in a tweet.

Tech program in Nano Science & Engineering” CeNSE says on its dedicated webpage about the programme.

For their minor students will get to choose from a buffet of thematic areas — nanoelectronics nanobio photonics microsystems and packaging quantum technology (in collaboration with Indian Quantum Science Initiative) and materials (in collaboration with the Department of Materials Engineering).

The IISc’s Centre for Nano Science and Engineering (CeNSE) is launching a Master of Technology (MTech) programme in Semiconductor Technology from the academic year 2023-24. The course work will begin in August 2023.

In response to the demand for a skilled workforce and cutting-edge research and development (R&D) in semiconductor technology the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bengaluru is initiating an interdisciplinary programme later this year.

One of the driving factors in this regard would be the availability of relevant academic programmes at India’s top educational institutions.

India’s aspiration to grow a semiconductor and display manufacturing ecosystem will necessarily require a talent pool equipped with relevant skills and those who are as close to market-ready as possible.

The Centre for Nano Science and Engineering ( @CeNSEatIISc ) is launching a new MTech programme in Semiconductor Technology with minors in Nano Science and Engineering. More details at: https://t.co/AGhxO3LaK9 pic.twitter.com/27wPzoMtro

Approximately 20 students that will be picked for the two-year programme will benefit from industrial interactions internships scholarships and fellowships as well as cutting-edge R&D facilities.

Intel Lam Research MacDermid Alpha and Applied Materials are already collaborating with CeNSE as part of its industry-sponsored fellowship offering at the MTech level.

CeNSE is a nearly 13-year-old centre at IISc pursuing interdisciplinary research on the nanoscale. It houses two state-of-the-art national facilities — the National Nanofabrication Centre (NNfC) and the Micro and Nano Characterization facility (MNCF) — besides 17 laboratories managed by various research groups.

A Masters programme with an exclusively semiconductor focus isn’t entirely new in India.

Last year (July 2022) the Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad initiated an MTech programme in Semiconductor Materials and Devices.

Offered by the Materials Science and Metallurgical Engineering department the programme is said to be “in line with the recent expansion of the vision of Aatmanirbhar Bharat in setting up of India Semiconductor Mission.”

Chipmakers like Intel Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and Samsung are all trying to expand their manufacturing capacity but this can't happen if there aren't enough engineers to design fabricate and verify the chips among various other roles needed in the semiconductor industry.

Deloitte predicts that by 2030 more than one million additional skilled workers beyond the over two million directly employed worldwide in 2021 will be needed to meet demand in the semiconductor industry. That amounts to an addition of more than 100000 workers annually.

The global talent shortage and therefore need for semiconductor fabs (building operation and analyses — at various levels of academic qualification) is an opportunity for India.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi even said last year that India wants to be a ""chip maker and not just a chip taker"". India will need a good talent pool of engineers for building and operating fabs in the near future.

The India Semiconductor Mission — launched to establish and handhold the semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem in India — is taking steps towards building a talent pool such as through the Chips to Startup (C2S) programme.

Further the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) in April last year approved two new courses in integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing and VLSI (very large scale integration) design and technology to help build a skilled and market-ready workforce for the semiconductor and display manufacturing industry.

“Practically any electronic device you can think of - mobile TV laptop car dashboard - has the semiconductor as its brain and display glass as its body. No device can be made without both elements” the Chairman of Vendanta Group Anil Agarwal wrote in the Economic Times.

“India is in pole position to become the fifth” country to manufacture both semiconductors and display glass.

Speaking last month at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting 2023 the Electronics and Information Technology Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said: “We see a huge potential for India to become a key semiconductor supplier for the entire world” adding that “we have tied up with many universities to prepare right talent”.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Posted on: February 5 2023 04:15h.

Last updated on: October 7 2023 01:05h.

The MGM Grand Las Vegas isn’t just the largest casino in Sin City. It’s the largest individual hotel building in the world according to the World Record Academy.

The Academy which logs a variety of business and personal records notes MGM Grand sits on 6.6 acres commanding 380000 square feet making it the largest hotel structure in the world.

(MGM Grand) has 6852 rooms and includes five outdoor pools rivers and waterfalls that cover 6.6 acres (2.7 ha) a 380000 square feet (35000 m2) convention center the MGM Grand Garden Arena and the Grand Spa; it also houses numerous shops night clubs restaurants and the largest casino in Clark County which occupies 171500 square feet (15930 m2)” notes the Academy.

By number of rooms MGM Grand is not the largest hotel in the world. That distinction belongs to the First World Hotel in Malaysia which has 7351 rooms.

MGM Grand History

MGM Grand opened on the Strip in December 1993 and cost an estimated $1.1 billion to build.

In January 2020 MGM announced the sale of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand to a joint venture controlled by MGM Growth Properties (MGP) and Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust (BREIT). At that time the breakdown was a 50.1% stake to MGP with BREIT owning the remainder.

That 50.1% was inherited by VICI Properties when it closed its $17.2 billion acquisition of MGM Growth in April 2022 — a transaction that created the largest gaming REIT in the US as well as the largest landlord on the Strip.

Last December VICI announced it would acquire the remaining 49.9% of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand for $4.27 billion as BREIT faced a liquidity crunch. That figure includes a cash consideration of $1.27 billion and the assumption of $3 billion in BREIT debt.

Translation: VICI Properties owns the real estate of MGM Grand while MGM Resorts remains the operator of the integrated resort. Another point worth noting: MGM Grand is the largest single hotel complex in the US. Overall the biggest is the combined Venetian and Palazzo — also on the Strip and owned by VICI.

Other Las Vegas Accolades

In addition to the MGM Grand’s accolades some others from the World Record Academy pertain to Las Vegas and Nevada.

The Academy says the Bonanza Gift Shop located on the Las Vegas Strip between the Sahara Las Vegas and the Strat is the world’s largest store of its kind. The world’s largest fireworks structure is found in Amargosa Valley Nevada. The 28-foot tall “M-800” firecracker covers a water tank.

As for the world’s largest hotels ranked by the number of rooms eleven of the top 20 including MGM Grand and all US-based venues are located in Las Vegas. That group also includes the Venetian Wynn and Encore Caesars Palace and MGM’s Aria among others. Las Vegas Sands’ Londoner Macau ranks by the number of rooms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvcmVtZW1iZXItd2hlbi1kb2RnZXJzLXRha2Utb3Zlci1zYW5kcy13aXRoLWpvZXktYmlzaG9wLXBob3Rvcy0yNzIzNzc2L9IBdmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJldmlld2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvcmVtZW1iZXItd2hlbi1kb2RnZXJzLXRha2Utb3Zlci1zYW5kcy13aXRoLWpvZXktYmlzaG9wLXBob3Rvcy0yNzIzNzc2L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,REMEMBER WHEN: Dodgers take over Sands with Joey Bishop — PHOTOS,"The Los Angeles Dodgers won the 1963 World Series — and then they had some fun!

When you read about the nine-figure contracts handed out this past offseason by Major League Baseball owners it might be hard to realize that players at one time had to find a job after the last putout was made to keep their families fed.

For some players it might have been with local car dealerships or businesses looking for a star to help with promotion. For the 1963 World Series Champion Los Angeles Dodgers it meant filling some time on stage at the Sands with Joey Bishop.

After sweeping the New York Yankees in the Fall Classic six Dodgers — pitchers Don Drysdale and Ron Perranoski outfielders Tommy Davis Willie Davis and Frank Howard and first baseman Bill “Moose” Skowron — hammed it up with one of the members of “The Rat Pack” on Dec. 21 1963 in the famed Copa Room.

I purchased the in-flight Wifi and hoped for the best expecting it to be glitchy or out of commission entirely. Once 10 a.m. rolled around the presale started and I was somewhere over Alabama with my family. The Wifi was actually fine; it was the presale that was the problem.

As we now know the Taylor Swift Ticketmaster presale for her upcoming ""Eras"" tour was a historic fiasco so much so the Justice Department got involved. But I scored tickets (not while on the plane – more on that later) and I'd like to help you try to get seats too for what will surely be the hottest concert ticket of the summer: Beyoncé's just announced ""Renaissance"" world tour.

There will be a ton of demand for these shows; like Swift Beyoncé hasn't done a solo tour for years and this is a massive global one. Shows will sell out. Inevitably the process of ticket buying will be stressful and complicated.

To give yourself the best chance possible to get those seats you need to do some planning in advance (i.e. now). You'll want to register for Verified Fan a program started by Ticketmaster intended to weed out bots and get tickets into the hands of real people. It's free and quick to sign up. It's meant to prevent resellers from competing with actual fans for tickets and there are often Verified Fan presales which mean tickets are available to those registered ahead of the general public.

Here's a breakdown of what we know about impending sales for the ""Renaissance"" world tour so far and ticket-buying tips from someone who survived the Swift trenches.

Verified Fan and presales

Tickets for Beyoncé's tour will start to go on sale in February – yes this month – for North American shows which begin in July. Ticket sales will apparently be split into three groups: BeyHive Presale Citi Presale and the General Verified Fan Onsale. There will also be a Verizon Up Presale.

Yes it's a lottery in the hopes of spending money. This is the world we live in now.

Verified Fan registration has already opened at Ticketmaster and windows in which to register will close at different points depending on your city with some ending as soon as . . . last Thursday mere days after the tour was even announced. So it's a good idea to decide where you hope to see a show and register for that location or locations as soon as possible. Rolling Stone calls Verified Fan ""your best bet for getting real verified Beyoncé tickets for now.""

Registering does not guarantee you tickets. But it gets you a chance to buy tickets via presales. Yes it's a lottery in the hopes of spending money. This is the world we live in now.

BeyHive members can register for Live Nation Verified Fan. Citi cardmembers can now register for Citi Verified Fan before the first Citi presale starts on Feb. 7.

Ticket resellers

If you miss out on tickets in presales or general sales or shows sell out (which they're almost certain to do) some tickets will end up on resellers including Vivid Seats and StubHub. The disadvantage of resellers is that the prices are often jacked up above face value. Some of my friends recommend waiting until the last minute when sellers are more likely to ""dump"" their unsold seats before a concert but this advice may not apply to big ticket shows like this tour.

In general it's a good idea to follow on social media the musicians you want to experience in concert. Tours are first announced on social media now and things like presale codes for those ticket presales that require them can often be found on Twitter Instagram or Reddit.

Following the venue in which you want to go to a concert is also smart thinking. A venue's social media account may announce presales provide promo codes or otherwise disseminate useful information to you future concert-attendee.

May the odds be ever in your favor

The best seats aren't always the first tickets released.

When it's the big ticket-buying day whether presale or general sales log into your account ahead of time (make an account with the ticket seller in advance and save your payment information). Know how much you want to spend and where you're hoping to be. Download or review a seating chart for the venue beforehand.

The best seats aren't always the first tickets released so if you don't get seats right away try to be patient and hang in there. It may take time to get through incredibly overloaded ticketing systems and more tickets may be released later or staggered on purpose.

I didn't get Swift tickets while in the air. Like thousands of others I got stuck in a virtual waiting room after spending much of my flight anticipating a scheduled presale that was hopelessly delayed. But eventually it did start. We had landed at our destination by then a family vacation. My kid was playing at the hotel arcade with his uncle and I had had one cocktail when I decided to try again. I logged into the presale and this time I got through. I got seats . . . and lost them. I got seats again and this time they went through.

Be persistent flexible and patient. You may not get excellent seats (my Swift tickets certainly aren't) but if you want to be in the room — or stadium — where it happens don't give up."

This is the third phase of a major tanker force rebuilding project. from the country.

On the last day 31 the USAF published in the SAM.gov a website for government contracts an information requirement (RFI) for several manufacturers who must submit by March 02nd their most diverse concepts for an “invisible to radar” tanker plane.

Proposals will be evaluated in October as part of the Next-Generation Air-Refueling System (NGAS) program. In addition to transferring and receiving fuel in the air the future aircraft must be able to survive in disputed airspace and support unmanned aerial systems.

Proponents must present what types of engines they would put in their aircraft and the savings achieved compared to current aircraft as well as ways they will respond to future threats.

The USAF says it is open to all ideas about the size and performance of the new aerial tanker but also wants participants to identify the projects' maturity level areas of greatest risk and how they would be mitigated in a development program.

According to Air & Space Forces Magazine the publication of RFI marks the formal beginning of NGAS formerly known as KC-Z the Air Force's third program for acquiring tankers. O Boeing KC-46 Pegasus was the winner of the KC-X; the KC-Y also called “bridge-tanker” still in progress seeks a link between generations of tankers. The current NGAS is the third and final phase of the USAF's tanker fleet recapitalization effort.

The Air Force ""is interested in innovative solutions in all size and performance classes that can meet the stressful mission requirements"" of delivering fuel in contested airspace the announcement said. The speed of the presented aircraft concepts “must be compatible with modern receivers”.

Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said the threat posed by China is driving the USAF away from traditional tankers based on commercial platforms adapted for military use. “The threat is taking that freedom away from us” he said adding that with new cargo and refueling aircraft designs the USAF needs to place ""a high value on survivability"".

Aircraft and missiles from China and other adversaries can track and shoot down tankers from long distances forcing the Air Force to move towards survivable concepts he said. The new plane will have to “go beyond” traditional concepts and “survive in an environment where the current fleet has not had to work”.

The RFI for the NGAS instructs companies to provide detailed performance characteristics of potential aircraft including size and weight landing takeoff climb and cruise performance relative to the mission profile.

The USAF also wants to know whether the proposed planes will be able to operate from regional makeshift or non-traditional airfields an issue in line with ACE (Agile Combat Employment) doctrine. This is a response to China which seeks to deploy air force assets in locations closer to the front line and with little infrastructure and ground support.

The USAF's RFI comes as major players such as Boeing have been presenting several concepts for new cargo and refueling aircraft employing the blended wing body (BWB) model which promises to incorporate improved stealth characteristics.

Kendall said there isn't a commercial BWB concept the Air Force can leverage ""yet"" but the service is looking into those concepts because commercial variants could also significantly reduce fuel consumption for the airline industry.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vcmlvZ3JhbmRlZ3VhcmRpYW4uY29tL3VuaXRlZC1sYXVuY2gtYWxsaWFuY2UtY2xvc2luZy1vcGVyYXRpb25zLWluLWhhcmxpbmdlbi0xMDAtd29ya2Vycy1pbXBhY3RlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,United Launch Alliance closing operations in Harlingen; 100 jobs lost – Rio Grande Guardian,"The economic development subcommittee of the Hidalgo County Prosperity Task Force says the focus must be on industries that produce high paying jobs.

The RFI issued by the USAF stated that the Department of the Air Force (DAF) is pursuing continued development of the next generation of tanker concepts that address the changing strategic environment. It has established the Next Generation Air-Refueling System (NGAS) project to advance those efforts.

“The team (DAF) is seeking information on innovative industry solutions that might fulfill the most stressing and complex air refueling mission requirements of the future fight” the RFI further said.

However the RFI also stated that a more formal process of exploring options called an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) is expected to begin in October 2023 suggesting that the service is yet to refine its specific requirements for NGAS.

“NGAS shall be required to address employment in contested scenarios. The DAF is interested in innovative solutions in all size and performance classes that might address the stressing mission requirements; airspeeds should be compatible with modern receivers” the RFI added.

The term “receivers” here refers to aircraft that would refuel from these future tankers.

Beyond that the RFI did not provide any details about possible requirements for the NGAS however reports suggest that the USAF wants future tankers to have stealth features to protect them from detection by radars associated with hostile weapon systems or platforms in contested environments.

US Already Working On Stealthy Aircraft

American aerospace and defense companies like Boeing and Lockheed Martin have already been working on design concepts for tankers or transport aircraft with blended wing-body (BWB) planforms that have at least some aspects of stealth to them.

A BWB aircraft design comprises a blended wing and fuselage instead of a traditional cylindrical fuselage with separate wings. This type of aircraft design offers more aerodynamic efficiency and better fuel economy.

Some prominent examples of BWB-designed military aircraft include the B-2 and B-21 stealth bombers.

However it is essential to note that while BWD designs are often very stealthy this is not necessarily a low-observable design. Its more apparent benefits include better aerodynamic performance improved fuel economy and a more extended range.

Last week during the 2023 AIAA SciTech Forum and Exposition Boeing unveiled a new stealthy BWB concept centered around the tactical airlift mission but it could also be applied to aerial refueling.

This new BWB airlifter design incorporates partial serpentine ducting into its engine inlets which helps to hide the turbine fan blades especially radar-reflective if left exposed. When used with fan-face baffles they can reduce the radar cross-section even from the most critical head-on aspect.

The exhaust and tail configuration also seems to be designed to reduce the plane’s infrared signature by making it difficult to see the exhaust from most angles and particularly from below. This reasonably common low-observable aircraft design characteristic dates back to the early days of stealth.

That said presently the design is very much in the conceptual phase and various elements of the new BWB design such as how air moves through its big ventral inlets are set to be analyzed through advanced modeling.

So far Boeing has been using internal research and development funding for this work. However the company is reportedly planning to pitch the design or derivatives thereof to various customers including the US military and especially the USAF in the future.

Likewise even Lockheed Martin unveiled a large blended wing cargo hauling aircraft design many years back called the Hybrid Wing Body (HWB) which comprises the blended wing concept with a large-T tail a rear ramp and turbofan engines mounted over the plane’s upper trailing edge.

Besides that Lockheed also displayed an HWB concept for tankers with an ‘H’ tail instead of a ‘T’-tail to reduce the aircraft’s radar profile while adding stability and enhanced flight control. Also the external overwing nacelles on the airlifter have been replaced with two embedded engines to improve stealth.

Stealthy Jets Useless Without Survivable Tankers?

The US military’s fifth-generation F-35 F-22 or even the upcoming sixth-generation stealth aircraft could be rendered useless without better tankers surviving in a contested environment.

For example as EurAsian Times reported earlier Australia’s fifth-generation F-35 stealth fighter jets have repeatedly come under the scanner because of their exorbitant prices and shortcomings in their capabilities relevant to Australia’s security needs such as the F-35A cannot reach the South China Sea without aerial refueling.

However the availability of aerial tankers is doubtful over contested airspace.

“Existing tankers exhibit a very large RCS (Radar Cross Section) value in the order of 80-100 square meters” Colonel Konstantinos Zikidis of the Hellenic Air Force (HAF) formerly a Deputy Commander at the HAF Telecomms and Electronics Depot (ETHM) told the EurAsian Times providing an example of the S-400 air defense system used by Russia and China.

“Taking into account the 91N6E search radar of the S-400 system and assuming that it can detect a target of four meters square RCS at 390 kilometers as per some open sources this radar could theoretically detect a large target such as a tanker at more than 800 kilometers even though that radar’s detection-range is limited to 600 kilometers” said Zikidis.

During a conflict keeping enemy tankers far away from the front would reduce the range and endurance of the attacking fighter jets.

That said stealthiness against radar is only one of the possible ways to help reduce vulnerability and the USAF may come up with an array of different defensive features and capabilities to have in its future tankers.

Also there are questions about the viability of forward aerial refueling operations entailing the tanker and receiver to be linked for a prolonged duration in a very high-end threat environment.

When asked about this Colonel Zikidis noted that “a stealthy tanker with a lower RCS value for example 1-meter square or less is expected to be detected at roughly 250 kilometers.”

“So if the tanker stays further than a safety distance of 300 kilometers it would be out of harm’s way which would be translated to an increase in the range and flying time of the enemy fighters posing a serious threat on the radar and any critical asset protected by this radar and the associated S-400 system” Zikidis concluded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiqwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5maW5hbmNpYWxleHByZXNzLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9kZWZlbmNlLWNvdW50ZG93bi10by1hZXJvLWluZGlhLW5ic3Bmb3ItaW5kaWEtZnJvbS1pbmRpYS1mb3ItdGhlLXdvcmxkLWxvY2toZWVkLW1hcnRpbi1yZWFmZmlybXMtaXRzLWNvbW1pdG1lbnQtdG8taW5kaWEtMjk3MTI1MC_SAbABaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZmluYW5jaWFsZXhwcmVzcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3MvZGVmZW5jZS1jb3VudGRvd24tdG8tYWVyby1pbmRpYS1uYnNwZm9yLWluZGlhLWZyb20taW5kaWEtZm9yLXRoZS13b3JsZC1sb2NraGVlZC1tYXJ0aW4tcmVhZmZpcm1zLWl0cy1jb21taXRtZW50LXRvLWluZGlhLTI5NzEyNTAvbGl0ZS8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Countdown to Aero India | For India From India for the World: Lockheed Martin reaffirms its commitment to India,"The US based aerospace company Lockheed Martin is set to showcase its latest advanced technology solutions during the 14th biennial edition of Aero-India 2023.

Also on display will be the Indian Navy’s recent rotary wing acquisition — MH-60R “Romeo” SEAHAWK helicopter. This helicopter is the most mature and capable Anti-Submarine (ASW)/Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) multi-mission helicopter available.

Background

Financial Express Online has reported earlier that in 2021 the first three MH-60R helicopters were delivered to India and these are being used to train Indian pilots and crew members in the US. Last July/August another three helicopters were received by the navy at Kochi International Airport and they will be based at Naval Air Station INS Garuda in Kochi. India has placed an order for a total of 24 MH-60Rs and these are coming through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and government to government. According to the company the delivery of all the machines will be completed over the next few years.

The platform-employed anti-tank precision weapon system and considered to be the most versatile one-man portable JAVELIN missile will be part of the company’s exhibit. This uses “fire-and-forget” technology and the weapon guides itself to the target. This technology allows the soldiers and platform assets to reposition out of harm’s way.

Guest columnist

To some of our neighbors Winterthur Museum Garden & Library remains a mystery tucked behind a hill off Route 52.

To first-time guests we're such a delightful destination that they can’t believe they haven’t visited before.

To longtime members we’re a constant source of beauty nature history and art.

First-time and repeat visitors might have an idea of what Winterthur is – a gorgeous estate and garden on nearly 1000 acres surrounding a 175-room house that contains an unparalleled collection of nearly 90000 objects made or used in America since 1640.

But that’s only part of our story.

You’re going to see national news coverage about an upcoming exhibition that’s drawing interest from historians fashion designers changemakers journalists artists and more.

For decades Ann Lowe designed gowns for America's most prominent society brides actresses and heiresses including Jacqueline Kennedy Olivia de Havilland Marjorie Merriweather Post and others among the du Ponts Rockefellers and Roosevelts.

Ann Lowe blazed a path for others and her legacy is still strongly felt in fashion culture. However this Black couturier remains virtually unknown to the wider public.

Winterthur Museum is making 2023 the year that her legacy receives the acclaim it has deserved.

""Ann Lowe: American Couturier'' – running from Sept. 9 until Jan. 7 2024 — will be the largest-ever exhibition of her work featuring 40 iconic gowns many of which have never been on public display and it will illuminate her evolution as a designer from the 1920s to the 1960s.

As part of the exhibition we recreated the wedding gown that Lowe designed for Jacqueline Kennedy. That painstaking process has been a remarkable exercise. The original dress is too delicate for display or transport.

The exhibition also will feature the work of contemporary fashion designers whose practices perspectives and careers reflect the trajectory of fashion emanating from Lowe's foundation.

We will open an exhibit in May 2023 about a special collaboration between the University of Delaware’s MakerGym and Winterthur’s textile conservation lab to create custom mannequins for the Lowe exhibition.

In March Winterthur debuts ""Winterthur: House of Style'' a month-long series of events where attendees will with industry experts examine the latest design trends and how those trends can translate into their own homes.

Speakers will offer workshops on subjects from flowers to rugs. Details and tickets will be available soon at Winterthur.org.

Of course in addition to new explorations we are indulging in our beloved annual traditions as well.

One that’s coming up quickly is ""Bank to Bend'' on March 11 when we will celebrate the wild-garden design aesthetic of the March Bank. Events include a lecture a plant sale and tours both guided and self-guided.

Another returning favorite is the 45th Annual Point-to-Point Steeplechase on May 7. This event is a festive day of steeplechase horse racing pageantry and fun and raises critical funds to support our work protecting and preserving the woodlands meadows and wetland habitats around the estate

And July 15-16 the annual Artisan Market returns which supports Winterthur's mission to inspire and educate audiences about American material culture art and design. This event showcases modern-day artisanship from the region’s most talented craftspeople.

Did you know that we also house a research library with a collection of more than 100000 books manuscripts periodicals and more? This wonderful collection is open by appointment Tuesday to Friday 10 a.m. to 4 pm; please contact reference@winterthur.org for more information or to schedule a time to visit.

Winterthur’s state-of-the-art conservation lab is the home to ongoing scientific work such as the Poison Book Project which is exploring the materiality of Victorian-era publishers’ bindings with a focus on the identification of toxic pigments used as book cloth colorants.

At the moment we are closed to the general public while we prepare for a busy year ahead. Our members enjoy daily year-round dawn-to-dusk garden and estate access. We reopen to all visitors on Feb. 28 Tuesdays through Sundays.

During our Yuletide celebration we’re open every day with evening hours on selected days.

As part of the ""House of Style'' in March visitors will get a sneak peek of this year’s Yuletide display at the pop-up exhibit called """"Fashioning Yuletide'' which will feature work from local designers Shawn Baron Pinckney and Asata Maisé Beeks. These two talented artists will speak about their design process and demonstrate some of their techniques. Their work is a reflection of modern designs influenced by Ann Lowe and H. F. du Pont’s interior designs at Winterthur.

There’s always something happening at Winterthur and we can hardly wait to see you in 2023.

A FedEx Express delivery van carried the trophy to the Super Bowl Experience Presented by Lowe’s officially kicking off the weeklong celebration leading up to Super Bowl LVII between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles.

“Each year FedEx is honored to play an essential role in the tradition of Super Bowl Week with the delivery of the Vince Lombardi Trophy” said Jenny Robertson Senior Vice President Integrated Marketing and Communications at FedEx. “Arizona continues to be a great host of the Super Bowl and we’re excited to help formally kick off football’s most-celebrated event.”

This year David Hokin a FedEx Express courier with 36 years of service had the honor of delivering the Vince Lombardi Trophy to the Super Bowl Experience Presented by Lowe’s. Awaiting Hokin’s key delivery was Super Bowl LII Champion Zach Ertz. Together the duo showcased the trophy in front of NFL fans and media before inviting attendees to snap a photo with it.

The historic Vince Lombardi Trophy which was handcrafted by artisans at Tiffany & Co. is made of sterling silver and depicts a regulation-size football in kicking position on a pyramid-like base that features the words ‘Vince Lombardi Trophy’ and ‘Super Bowl LVII’ along with the NFL shield.

Fans in the Phoenix area can stop by and view the trophy up close at the Super Bowl Experience Presented by Lowe’s starting Saturday Feb. 4 & Sunday Feb. 5 and again on Thursday Feb. 9 – Saturday Feb. 11 at the Phoenix Convention Center. On Sunday Feb. 12 it will be awarded to either the Kansas City Chiefs or Philadelphia Eagles commemorating the Super Bowl LVII Champion for the 2022-2023 NFL season.

“Seeing the iconic Vince Lombardi Trophy up-close at Super Bowl Experience is a thrill for football fans across the country” said Peter O’Reilly NFL EVP of Club Business and League Events. “Our friends at FedEx ensure the trophy’s safe and timely delivery each year which continues to be an essential part of Super Bowl Week.”

In the shocking world of Netflix's docuseries Tiger King: Murder Mayhem and Madness there was a sordid undercurrent to the story making the phenomenon of mugshots arrests and prison sentences something familiar. There is of course the series' main character Joe Exotic who is currently serving a 22-year prison sentence. According to CNN Joe ""shot and killed five tigers sold baby lemurs and falsified paperwork to say they were donated and tried to pay a hit man $3000 to kill a rival."" Yikes.

But Joe isn't the only person in the series who has experienced legal trouble. Remember Jeff Lowe who rolled into the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park driving his Ferrari acting like the pompous ""savior"" of the place? When Joe couldn't pay the lawsuit against Carole Baskin he sighed the park over to Lowe hoping to protect it.

Daisy Lowe has shared some snaps of her and her swelling baby bump hitting up the gym – and she looks fabulous.

The 34-year-old is all set to become a first time mother after she broke the news in October last year that she and fiancé Jordan Saul 28 were expecting.

Property developer Jordan popped the question to his model girlfriend just one month before their pregnancy announcement and two years into their relationship.

Taking to Instagram the former Strictly Come Dancing star wrote: ‘We took this picture this afternoon moments before @jordanjaysaul ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM!!!

‘I said f**k yes… i am officially your fiancé & I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you my hubby to be ♥️💍♥️.’

Rumour has it the pair met on a dog walk in the pandemic and have grown from strength to strength ever since.

Daisy’s baby bump is getting much bigger (Picture: Daisy Lowe/Instagram)

Daisy and fiancé Jordan Saul are ‘bursting with excitement’ over the pregnancy (Picture: Getty Images

Now Daisy is looking forward to welcoming their baby into the world and has shared her journey with fans throughout.

In her most recent picture in her baby diaries the DJ can be seen sitting on the floor in front of a mirror at the gym sporting some bold pink leggings a crop top and a big baby bump.

Daisy captioned the image with: ‘Sunday stretching’.

The model previously described how becoming a mum was always ‘something [she’s] wanted with all [her] heart’ and how for a long time it was ‘the only thing’ she ‘ever wanted’.

The model seems to be embracing pregnancy with all its ups and downs (Picture: Daisy Lowe/Instagram)

‘It took a long time a lot of heartbreak & healing and a whole lot of picking myself back up again to get to a place where I could even possibly conceive & here we are now…’ she continued.

Keen not to paint pregnancy as a walk in the park Daisy has also been open about the ‘insane ups and downs hormonally the nausea the growing pains the sleepless nights’ and ‘the exhaustion’ of pregnancy.

When announcing the news Daisy said the parents-to-be were ‘bursting at the seams with happiness’.

‘I’m oscillating wildly between excitement & nervousness with a dash of morning sickness thrown in for good measure!’ she said.

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vc3BvcnRzL21hcmluZXJzL2p1bGlvLXJvZHJpZ3Vlei1wcm92aWRlcy1tcy13aXRoLW11Y2gtbmVlZGVkLXBvd2VyLWJ1cnN0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Julio Rodriguez provides M's with much-needed power burst,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

The three-time Pro Bowler turned Fox Sports broadcaster has closed on a $4.5M seed round for his new youth sports content and commerce company Youth Inc. a platform that aims to not only entertain and educate listeners but serve as a direct-to-consumer merchandise marketplace.

“This is something that I live every day whether it’s through my own kids or spending time training other people’s kids” Olsen a father of three said in an interview. “Five six days a week I’m in the community living the youth sports experience as a dad as a coach and as a former athlete … If we build out this platform the right way this can be a lasting resource that millions of families throughout the country can rely on.”

The initial funding round was led by Will Ventures with co-investments from Ryan Sports Ventures Hello Sunshine co-founder Jim Toth and private equity fund ISOS Ventures.

Olsen who founded Youth Inc. parent company Audiorama with former Carolina Panthers teammate Ryan Kalil received help from other football brethren. Star quarterbacks Josh Allen (Buffalo Bills) and CJ Stroud (Houston Texans) as well as Ohio State head coach Ryan Day contributed to the round.

Audiorama which is backed by Powerhouse Capital was launched by Olsen Kalil and Hollywood actor Vince Vaughn in March of 2022. The production company debuted its first podcast (Youth Inc.) that same month originally as a pure content play where parents coaches and others can explore the changing world of youth sports nationwide during a show hosted by Olsen.

It wasn’t long after season one was complete that Olsen developed bigger ambitions of creating an all-encompassing youth sports platform that can satisfy a wider range of needs in the market. Fueled by new capital Olsen and his team are pivoting with plans to launch the new Youth Inc. platform later this year.

Youth Inc. has tapped some of the more experienced executives in the space to lead the company’s evolution as it goes from podcast to a standalone media and e-commerce company that will be based in Nashville and the greater Philadelphia area.

Tim Murphy who is the former executive vice president of strategy and business development at Audacy will serve as the company’s president of media while former Fanatics director of business development Ryan Baise will serve as CEO and will spearhead the brand’s on-demand DTC marketplace.

Baise who oversaw new ventures for e-commerce giant Fanatics understands the complexities and logistic challenges that come with delivering merchandise for a range of different teams and sports from tennis to basketball. The former Illinois quarterback says what will be key is building a destination brand and creating brand affinity.

“We’re going to build this commerce platform that services the market with a completely differentiated supply chain than anything that exists out there today” he said.

The leaders of Youth Inc. are hoping that within a handful of years their platform will be a streamlined one-stop shop for customers to experience premium media content or score their favorite team’s uniform while also offering business-to-business services including helping larger youth sports organizations manage its merchandise functions.

“Once people get exposed to us then we can service all of their needs on our e-commerce site whether that’s team store fan wear player uniform and other merchandise” said Olsen the son of longtime high school football coach Chris Olsen. “We think the content piece really feeds the commerce and obviously the commerce feeds back into people finding us and having access to our content information that we publish.”"

Since the Russia and Ukraine war started global oil companies have mirrored a hike in their profit as for a certain period of time oil export from Russia was halted or countries were fearing to purchase oil from them.

Russia is the leading oil supplier in the global oil market and due to the war situation the global oil market was affected. However the market tried hard to control the volatility and at some point it was successful.

Founded in 1871 in New York Marsh & McLennan is the parent company of four globally operating professional services groups: Marsh and Guy Carpenter (both focus on insurance and reinsurance services) Mercer (human capital consulting) and Oliver Wyman (strategy and management consulting with subsidiaries Nera Economic Consulting and Lippincott focusing on economics consultancy and brand and design services).

Continuing a long streak of growth “2022 was an outstanding year for Marsh McLennan” said CEO John Doyle. “We generated revenue growth of 5% (underlying growth of 9%) while continuing to invest in our talent and capabilities both organically and through acquisitions.”

Marsh McLennan’s consulting division accounted for more than $8 billion of its overall $20.7 billion total with Mercer and Oliver Wyman adding $4 billion to its take over the past three years.

Oliver Wyman was the group’s star performer continuing its double-digit march to book 2022 revenues of $2.8 billion – on the back of 10% growth 13% in underlying terms.

While perhaps down on the 21 percent growth boom in 2021 as businesses looked for support to rebound from the worst of Covid-19 Olive Wyman’s 10% rise in revenue over the past twelve months still represents a sizable jump on pre-pandemic figures when the consultancy was averaging around 7 percent in annual growth.

Now the firm is truly ensconced among the top handful of traditional strategic consultancies by revenue behind the MBB (McKinsey Boston Consulting Group and Bain & Company) alone and ahead of Kearney Strategy& Roland Berger L.E.K. Consulting and Arthur D. Little among others.

In a list of the world’s best management consulting firms compiled by market researchers Statista and published last year by Forbes which took into account the opinions of both industry professionals and consulting clients from around the world Oliver Wyman received a four-star rating or was “frequently recommended” across six of its lines including among other areas strategy operations management organisation & change and finance risk & compliance.

Not just in a financial sense but 2022 was also a bumper year on the news front with Oliver Wyman’s purchase of Booz Allen Hamilton’s management consulting business in the Middle East and North Africa one major highlight. The firm also increased its Australian presence via the acquisition of Perth-based advisory Azure Consulting and launched new offices in Abu Dhabi Austria and Belgium – taking the firm’s count above 70 offices in 30 countries worldwide.

And the start to this year has been no less busy particularly in terms of personnel. In addition to a record round of 78 new-year partnership promotions Oliver Wyman last month appointed new global cyber risk and CMT leads Laurent Bensoussan and Souheil Moukaddem and has also recently welcomed a number of new country leads: Cornelia Neumann in Holland Grigoris Zarifopoulos as a co-lead for Greece and Lisa Quest as the head of UK and Ireland.

Looking ahead Doyle said that Marsh McLennan’s services will continue to be in high demand in 2023 despite the economic uncertainty casting a shadow on the global economy. “Our expertise across the important areas of risk strategy and people is more relevant than ever as we help clients navigate an uncertain world.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) does carry debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?

When Is Debt A Problem?

Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad the lenders can take control of the business. However a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices permanently diluting shareholders just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course plenty of companies use debt to fund growth without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels we first consider both cash and debt levels together.

See our latest analysis for Mastercard

How Much Debt Does Mastercard Carry?

As you can see below Mastercard had US$14.0b of debt at December 2022 which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However it also had US$7.41b in cash and so its net debt is US$6.62b.

A Look At Mastercard's Liabilities

We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Mastercard had liabilities of US$14.2b falling due within a year and liabilities of US$18.2b due beyond that. Offsetting this it had US$7.41b in cash and US$3.43b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$21.5b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.

Of course Mastercard has a titanic market capitalization of US$357.5b so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet going forward.

We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover for short). This way we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt as well as the interest rates paid on it.

Mastercard's net debt is only 0.49 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 30.9 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. Another good sign is that Mastercard has been able to increase its EBIT by 24% in twelve months making it easier to pay down debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Mastercard can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.

Story continues

Finally while the tax-man may adore accounting profits lenders only accept cold hard cash. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. During the last three years Mastercard generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 81% of its EBIT more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.

Our View

Happily Mastercard's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Considering this range of factors it seems to us that Mastercard is quite prudent with its debt and the risks seem well managed. So we're not worried about the use of a little leverage on the balance sheet. When analysing debt levels the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. We've identified 1 warning sign with Mastercard  and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

On Friday Feb. 3 Mastercard’s vp of global sponsorships Laytoya Bennett-Johnson was joined by trailblazing rappers Salt-N-Pepa emerging rapper Baby Tate Grammy-nominated rapper Rapsody entrepreneur Bridgid Coulter Cheadle and journalist Gia Peppers who moderated the conversation.

The panelists were invited to speak about how they’ve built their brands the ways in which entrepreneurship and creativity have impacted their businesses and musical careers how they define success as women working in and around the entertainment industry and more.

“Before you step into this business you’ve got to know who you are and which lines you won’t cross” Rapsody said to the group and guests. “When I was young and looking at what I thought was success — platinum plaques and sold-out arenas — [I later realized] those are materialistic things. When you can sit at home and look in the mirror and be at peace [that’s success].”

Salt-N-Pepa shared stories about how they first formed as a group in the mid-1980s and the confidence it took to succeed as female emcees along with some of the challenges they faced along the way and how faith got them through.

“Because I was so convinced in my mind that I was going to be able to make this happen that’s what pushed me forward. It was when I got on the microphone and found my voice” Cheryl ‘Salt’ James shared adding “Authenticity leads to longevity.”

“Coming up in hip-hop as female emcees in a male-dominated field it was very hard for us knowing we were charting so hard — more than the male rappers — and still weren’t getting that respect or the acknowledgment that we deserved” Sandra ‘Pepa’ Denton said. “[But] I had my eyes on the prize from day one.”

Beginning Thursday Feb. 2 and running through Saturday Feb. 4 these discussions are being held at venues owned by Black women across Los Angeles. Last night’s event was hosted by Blackbird Collective a global private membership collective of flexible work and wellness spaces centered on women of color. Headquartered in Culver City and founded by Cheadle who is also an actress and interior designer the space was a fitting setting for the evening’s festivities which were punctuated by a surprise $5000 gift to Blackbird from Mastercard. The founder spoke about how underresourced Black female entrepreneurs generally are despite being the fastest-growing demographic of entrepreneurs in the U.S.

“We do it with less and we do better” Cheadle said adding: “In those quiet moments when you’re by yourself and you just are resonating with your truth and your authenticity in those moments when you’re really scared but you keep acting in spite of to me that is success.”

Baby Tate who closed out the night with a post-panel performance shared insights about challenges she faces in the music industry as a Black woman in particular like body image and colorism which her male peers don’t struggle with in the same way.

“It’s crazy that as women we have to be under such a microscope like we can’t just exist as we are” she said. “Why can’t I just say what I want to say? I have a message that I want to spread.”

The final installment in the series happens Saturday night and is about building Black wealth moderated by Amanda Seales and featuring female rappers Yo-Yo and Coi Leray and entrepreneur Simone Smith as panelists.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzAyLzA0L3Zpc2EtYW5kLW1hc3RlcmNhcmQtc2hvdy1vbmNlLWFnYWluLXdoeS1oeXBlcmluZmxhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Visa and Mastercard Show Once Again Why Hyperinflation Fears Are Overblown,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzAyLzA0L3Zpc2EtYW5kLW1hc3RlcmNhcmQtc2hvdy1vbmNlLWFnYWluLXdoeS1oeXBlcmluZmxhL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025625E296C0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Before long magazines began wooing the petite rap star with fashion shoots using famous stylists but even at a young age Lil’ Kim stood her ground. She insisted on sticking with her trusted stylist Misa Hylton.

And Lil’ Kim’s loyalty taught the trailblazing fashionista an indelible lesson. “[It’s important to] realize your power and your voice” Hylton said Thursday alongside the rap icon at a panel on entrepreneurship and collaboration in Los Angeles. “You can demand what you want and you can bring your sisters with you.”

Hylton and Lil’ Kim were part of a series of panel discussions organized by Mastercard and Femme It Forward the female-led music and entertainment company in advance of the Grammy Awards Sunday night and the 50th anniversary of hip-hop. Music icons emerging artists and small business owners shared their insights to inspire the next generation of Black women entrepreneurs as part of a larger campaign to equip them with the tools resources and funding they need to thrive.

Thursday’s panel also featured rappers and songwriters MC Lyte and Jozzy digital creator Rhonda X and entrepreneur Leslie Jones co-owner of host venue 1010 Wines. With music journalist Niama Cochran as moderator the women discussed overcoming business challenges team building embracing change and lifting others up. Here are five takeaways:

01

Never stop learning

Rhonda X was running a salon in Atlanta when COVID hit and social distancing crushed the industry — but virtual worlds were thriving. So she started teaching herself about technology and now she’s a digital content creator working with Mastercard in the metaverse space: “I gave myself permission to be a beginner.” As a hip-hop star actress and radio personality MC Lyte’s career is everything she dreamt of as a 7-year-old growing up in Brooklyn. But she never assumed that her celebrity status entitled her to new opportunities. “I had to prepare myself” she said of taking classes as an adult. “I couldn’t just show up because I was MC Lyte. I had to know the skill set.”

02

Know yourself — and where you need help

Being honest with yourself is paramount according to Lil’ Kim who said women need to know what they’re good at and what they aren’t: “That’s how you build your team.” When you start hiring make sure you put your business needs first Hylton advised — avoid hiring friends and family. Bring aboard people who know about things that you don’t MC Lyte said and learn how to express what you want and what you don’t clearly.

03

Focus

Arrive at work with 100% focus so people know you’re ready to work and open to create MC Lyte said. Jones believes being present is especially important when you’re starting out. That’s partly what helped her transform an automotive garage into the packed wine bar where Thursday’s panel was hosted an experience she describes as “really surreal.”

04

Embrace change (even when it's hard)

Music technology and culture are constantly changing so it’s important to know how to pivot. “Being adaptable for me has been embracing technology and taking the time to learn about technology which I naturally do not like” Hylton said. Paying attention to how things are changing is also key she said. Make sure you think beyond today.

05

Give back

For Hylton who faced an uphill road when she was starting out as a stylist sharing what she’s learned has been important. She founded the Misa Hylton Fashion Academy to do just that. “It was about giving back and sharing the information to people who look like me who came from places that were marginalized underserved” she said.

While the Soviet Union emerged as a force to be reckoned with in volleyball in the early Olympic years Brazil Cuba and China have grown in stature in recent times.

Want to know more about basic volleyball rules and regulations at the Olympics? Here is a brief tell-all:

Volleyball rules

The number of players in volleyball is six on each side with the teams separated by a net in the middle.

The team that wins the pre-game coin toss gets the opportunity to serve the ball first. The aim of the server is to hit the ball over the net from behind the baseline over to the opposition’s team half to start a rally.

Teams are allowed a maximum of three consecutive touches after which they have to send the ball into the opposition’s half. The player that receives the serve attempts to control the ball and loop it in the direction of one of their team-mates. This is known as the ‘pass’ or the ‘bump set’ which is executed with the forearms.

The player that gets the second touch is usually the ‘setter’ who loops the ball up as close to the edge of the net as possible setting up a smash known as a ‘spike’ in volleyball.

The opposition team attempts to block the ball by often positioning their tallest and most athletic players close to the net and the rally continues until one of the teams commits a fault or if the ball hits the ground.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vd3dlLXNldHRpbmctdXAtbWl4ZWQtdGFnLXRlYW0tbWF0Y2gtZm9yLWJyYXktd3lhdHQtYWxleGEtYmxpc3MtYXQtd3Jlc3RsZW1hbmlhLTM5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Is WWE Setting Up a Mixed Tag Team Match For Bray Wyatt & Alexa Bliss At WrestleMania 39?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with ('Connection aborted.', RemoteDisconnected('Remote end closed connection without response')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXNwb3J0c3Rlci5jb20vd3dlLXNldHRpbmctdXAtbWl4ZWQtdGFnLXRlYW0tbWF0Y2gtZm9yLWJyYXktd3lhdHQtYWxleGEtYmxpc3MtYXQtd3Jlc3RsZW1hbmlhLTM5L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF0cHRvdXIuY29tL2VuL25ld3MvZ3JlYXQtYnJpdGFpbi1jb2xvbWJpYS1kYXZpcy1jdXAtcXVhbGlmaWVyLTIwMjMtc2F0dXJkYXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Norrie Sends Great Britain Through To Davis Cup Finals Group Stage,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.atptour.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /en/news/great-britain-colombia-davis-cup-qualifier-2023-saturday (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025625894280>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF0cHRvdXIuY29tL2VuL25ld3MvZ3JlYXQtYnJpdGFpbi1jb2xvbWJpYS1kYXZpcy1jdXAtcXVhbGlmaWVyLTIwMjMtc2F0dXJkYXnSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2NhbmNocm9uaWNsZS5jb20vbmF0aW9uL2luLW90aGVyLW5ld3MvMDYwMjIzL3NhcmF0aC1yZWRkeS1kZXN0cm95ZWQtZGlnaXRhbC1ldmlkZW5jZS1pcC1hZGRyZXNzZXMtbWF0Y2gtZWQuaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWNjYW5jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL2FtcC9uYXRpb24vaW4tb3RoZXItbmV3cy8wNjAyMjMvc2FyYXRoLXJlZGR5LWRlc3Ryb3llZC1kaWdpdGFsLWV2aWRlbmNlLWlwLWFkZHJlc3Nlcy1tYXRjaC1lZC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sarath Reddy destroyed digital evidence IP addresses match: ED,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.deccanchronicle.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /nation/in-other-news/060223/sarath-reddy-destroyed-digital-evidence-ip-addresses-match-ed.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000256258943A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRlY2NhbmNocm9uaWNsZS5jb20vbmF0aW9uL2luLW90aGVyLW5ld3MvMDYwMjIzL3NhcmF0aC1yZWRkeS1kZXN0cm95ZWQtZGlnaXRhbC1ldmlkZW5jZS1pcC1hZGRyZXNzZXMtbWF0Y2gtZWQuaHRtbNIBggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kZWNjYW5jaHJvbmljbGUuY29tL2FtcC9uYXRpb24vaW4tb3RoZXItbmV3cy8wNjAyMjMvc2FyYXRoLXJlZGR5LWRlc3Ryb3llZC1kaWdpdGFsLWV2aWRlbmNlLWlwLWFkZHJlc3Nlcy1tYXRjaC1lZC5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vb2x5bXBpY3MuY29tL2VuL25ld3MvZGF2aXMtY3VwLTIwMjMtdGVubmlzLXdvcmxkLWdyb3VwLWktcGxheW9mZnMtaW5kaWEtdnMtZGVubWFyay1yZXN1bHQtc2NvcmVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Davis Cup 2023 tennis: India vs Denmark result and scores,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vb2x5bXBpY3MuY29tL2VuL25ld3MvZGF2aXMtY3VwLTIwMjMtdGVubmlzLXdvcmxkLWdyb3VwLWktcGxheW9mZnMtaW5kaWEtdnMtZGVubWFyay1yZXN1bHQtc2NvcmVz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025625897730>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

At least that’s what the Pittsburgh Steelers’ fourth-round draft pick credits for his own sense of loyalty.

An FCS football player out of the Missouri Valley Football Conference’s South Dakota State Jackrabbits McCormick faced the same challenges as any small-school prospect. No matter how well you dominate your competition you’re always asked who did you beat? Such questions often cap their potential to the middle rounds of the draft.

A lot of times NFL-worthy prospects from small schools must answer those questions in Bowl games and practices. Arguably fewer small-school players make it this far because those who have that talent enter the transfer portal. They end up changing schools where they can raise their profile. McCormick never did despite the opportunity to do so and he explained why.

“Yes I had offers. The temptation was not there” he told reporters on Friday via the team’s website. “South Dakota State gave so much to me and developed me into who I am now. Who am I to leave South Dakota State? They poured so much into me. I feel like they should be able to reap the benefits of what they helped create. Sure some money would be cool or whatever but it’s just ultimately my loyalties lie with the people that are good to me.”

Reporters asked him questions in the same vein after the draft and he gave the same answer. “I feel like in today’s world loyalty is kind of an afterthought” he said at the time via 93.7 The Fan. “South Dakota State did so much for me it was a no-brainer for me to be loyal to them.”

McCormick first arrived at South Dakota State in 2018 redshirting his first season as a zero-star prospect from Sioux Falls. He managed two starts the following season before the COVID-19 pandemic wiped out his redshirt sophomore year. In all he spent six years there logging comfortably over 3000 career snaps on the offensive line.

We’ll see how loyalty influences McCormick’s relationship with the Pittsburgh Steelers moving forward. He has a chance to earn a starting job though not as a rookie. They drafted him after taking linemen in the first two rounds precisely for that reason. If he does crack the starting lineup will he show loyalty to the Steelers when he hits free agency?

That doesn’t mean taking a cheap contract because business is always a part of the equation. But for some more than others so are our core values. McCormick credits his family for the emphasis he puts on loyalty.

“I think that’s just the way I was raised” he said. “People that are good to you you should be great to them and give back to them. That’s just the way it’s always been for me.”

Loyalty. It’s an easy talk to talk but try walking it and most will fall on their face. McCormick stayed loyal to South Dakota State and it served him well to get this far.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scoop: McCormick PAC launches big ad buy in Pennsylvania Senate race,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.axios.com/2024/05/08/mccormick-pac-ad-pennsylvania-senate-casey on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiS2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF4aW9zLmNvbS8yMDI0LzA1LzA4L21jY29ybWljay1wYWMtYWQtcGVubnN5bHZhbmlhLXNlbmF0ZS1jYXNledIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L3NucC1sZWFkZXJzaGlwLWNoYWxsZW5nZXItZ3JhZW1lLW1jY29ybWljay1wdWxscy1vdXQtb2YtcmFjZS0xMzEzMDMwMtIBZGh0dHBzOi8vbmV3cy5za3kuY29tL3N0b3J5L2FtcC9zbnAtbGVhZGVyc2hpcC1jaGFsbGVuZ2VyLWdyYWVtZS1tY2Nvcm1pY2stcHVsbHMtb3V0LW9mLXJhY2UtMTMxMzAzMDI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,John Swinney set to become next SNP leader and Scottish first minister as rival quits race,"John Swinney appears set to become Scotland's next first minister after Graeme McCormick pulled out of the race to become SNP leader.

Mr McCormick's decision not to pursue a leadership bid leaves Mr Swinney as the only official candidate after Humza Yousaf announced he is stepping down.

Mr Yousaf said he was resigning last week after he decided to end the power-sharing agreement with the Scottish Green Party.

Reports of a contest began early on Sunday when Mr McCormick said he had secured the 100 nominations from 20 branches needed to run against Mr Swinney.

But in a statement shared with Sky News the party activist said he had had a ""lengthy and fruitful conversation"" with Mr Swinney adding he had ""met the threshold set by the party rules"".

""John and I agreed the challenges which the SNP our government and our people face and explored new thinking on a range of issues which I am confident as they are advanced will inspire activists both within the SNP and wider independence movement in the following weeks and months"" he said.

""This is a fresh start for our members and our politicians and I'm sure that John's determination to deliver Independence will be rewarded at the forthcoming general election.

""I have therefore concluded that I shall not proceed with my nomination for party leader but instead support John Swinney's nomination for party leader and first minister of Scotland.""

It means the party will avoid a three-week leadership contest which would have been triggered had Mr McCormick not stepped aside and received the required 100 nominations.

Assuming there are no last-minute challengers the leadership bid will not have to be put to SNP members and Mr Swinney is likely to become Scotland's next first minister as early as Tuesday.

Barring a bombshell - Swinney will become leader today Connor Gillies Scotland correspondent @ConnorGillies The SNP establishment is quietly breathing a sigh of relief after a wildcard challenger pulled the plug. Grassroots member Graeme McCormick has been a thorn in the side of the party hierarchy for a long time but the truth is he never stood a chance of becoming leader. Apparently he was gathering the required 100 signatures from party members on his clipboard at an independence rally in Glasgow on Saturday. It doesn't get more grassroots than that. His move to trigger a contest would have delayed the inevitable Swinney win but it would have forced the party to spend three weeks having another internal debate. It would have been difficult (and embarrassing) for Mr Swinney and co as they try and pull a divided party back together. Mr McCormick told Sky News he had a discussion with Mr Swinney on Sunday and it seems the pair came to some sort of agreement. Many will see this as a small diplomatic win for the incoming first minister as he uses soft power to spare the SNP’s blushes. Barring a bombshell Mr Swinney will become leader tomorrow and first minister of Scotland on Tuesday as Humza Yousaf packs his bags and heads for the same door he kicked the Greens out of a few weeks ago.

Who is John Swinney?

What direction will the SNP take?

Earlier on Sunday Mr Swinney warned potential challengers from entering the race saying it would delay the party from ""rebuilding"".

""My bid to become SNP leader has received very very comprehensive support within the SNP. I have sent out a message which is about unifying the SNP to strengthen our party and win Scottish independence"" he told Sky's Trevor Phillips.

""I think that is necessary as the SNP is not as cohesive today as the party needs to be and my campaign has attracted very wide support.

""So I think the SNP has got a chance to start rebuilding from the difficult period that we've had under my leadership and bluntly I would just like to get on with that as quickly as I can do because every day that we spend in an internal contest which I think we all probably know the outcome of we delay the ability for the SNP to start its rebuilding and I want to get on with that as quickly as I possibly can do."""

(Reuters) -Merck said on Monday it had discontinued an experimental combination treatment testing a new type of immunotherapy in patients with a severe form of skin cancer after side effects led to high discontinuation.

This is the latest setback for the experimental drug vibostolimab and the related promising new class of immunotherapies called anti-TIGIT.

Merck was testing vibostolimab along with Keytruda its top-selling cancer drug in a late-stage study in patients with resected high-risk melanoma.

An analysis showed the trial will not achieve the main goal of statistically significant improvement in recurrence-free survival as more side effects led to several patients discontinuing the combination treatment versus those on Keytruda alone Merck said.

The company will recommend patients receiving the combination treatment be offered the Keytruda monotherapy.

Vibostolimab works by selectively binding itself to TIGIT a receptor on immune cells to activate the immune system against cancer cells.

Merck said it still had an extensive clinical development program evaluating the vibostolimab-Keytruda combination.

The combination treatment had earlier failed to significantly slow disease progression in lung cancer patients in a late-stage study last year.

Data from another trial in March last year had also showed that it was less effective than a generic medicine called docetaxel in some patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

Gilead Sciences Roche and GSK are among half a dozen drugmakers looking to grab a share of the lucrative anti-TIGIT cancer drug market but the field has seen multiple setbacks.

Gilead and its partner Arcus Biosciences in January stopped a late-stage trial involving their anti-TIGIT candidate domvanalimab in a type of lung cancer. Gilead has announced a $320 million investment in its biotech partner as it refocused its anti-TIGIT push.

May 13 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Merck (NYSE: MRK) known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada today announced the discontinuation of the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation arm of the Phase 3 KeyVibe-010 trial. The trial is evaluating the investigational coformulation of vibostolimab an anti-TIGIT antibody and pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy compared to KEYTRUDA alone as adjuvant treatment for patients with resected high-risk melanoma (Stage IIB-IV). At a pre-planned analysis data showed that the primary endpoint of recurrence-free survival (RFS) met the pre-specified futility criteria. A higher rate of discontinuation of all adjuvant therapy by patients in the coformulation arm versus the KEYTRUDA-only arm primarily due to immune-mediated adverse experiences rendered it highly unlikely that the trial could achieve a statistically significant improvement in RFS. Based on the recommendation of an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) Merck is unblinding the study and recommends that patients receiving the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation be offered the option to be treated with KEYTRUDA monotherapy. Data analysis from this study is ongoing. Results will be shared with the scientific community and communicated to regulatory agencies.

""Through our clinical development program we continue to ask the tough questions in an effort to fully explore the potential of novel coformulations and combinations that build on the foundation of KEYTRUDA with a goal to improve upon current standards of care and help even more patients with cancer"" said Dr. Marjorie Green senior vice president and head of oncology global clinical development Merck Research Laboratories. ""We are grateful to the patients and investigators for their participation and will leverage insights from this trial as we rapidly advance our diverse pipeline of novel mechanisms including further study of this coformulation in lung cancer.""

Merck is committed to the development of new treatment options for patients with melanoma including in earlier stages of disease which build upon the current standard of care. The program includes the ongoing Phase 3 V940-001 study in collaboration with Moderna evaluating V940 (mRNA-4157) an investigational individualized neoantigen therapy (INT) in combination with KEYTRUDA as adjuvant treatment in patients with resected high-risk (Stage IIB-IV) melanoma.

In the U.S. KEYTRUDA has two approved indications in melanoma: for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma and for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB IIC or III melanoma following complete resection.

Story continues

Vibostolimab is Merck’s investigational anti-TIGIT antibody that restores antitumor activity by blocking the TIGIT receptor from binding to its ligands (CD112 and CD155) thereby activating T lymphocytes that help destroy tumor cells. Merck has an extensive clinical development program evaluating the safety and efficacy of the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation alone and in combination with other agents in over 3000 patients.

Ongoing Phase 3 studies evaluating the vibostolimab and pembrolizumab coformulation in lung cancer which are routinely monitored by external data monitoring committees include KeyVibe-003 KeyVibe-006 KeyVibe-007 and KeyVibe-008. Interim external data monitoring committee safety reviews have not resulted in any safety-related study modifications to date. No changes to these studies are anticipated based on the KeyVibe-010 findings.

About KeyVibe-010

KeyVibe-010 is a randomized double-blind active comparator-controlled Phase 3 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05665595) evaluating a coformulation of vibostolimab and pembrolizumab (MK-7684A) versus KEYTRUDA alone as adjuvant treatment for patients with resected high-risk Stage IIB-IV melanoma. The trial’s primary endpoint is RFS. Key secondary endpoints include distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and overall survival (OS). The study enrolled 1594 patients who were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive:

Vibostolimab/pembrolizumab coformulation (pembrolizumab 200 mg/20 mL and vibostolimab 200 mg intravenously [IV] every 3 three weeks [Q3W] for up to 17 cycles); or

Pembrolizumab (adult patients receive 200 mg and adolescent patients ≥40 kg receive 2 mg/kg [up to a maximum of 200 mg] IV Q3W for up to 17 cycles).

About melanoma

Melanoma the most serious form of skin cancer is characterized by the uncontrolled growth of pigment-producing cells. The rates of melanoma have been rising over the past few decades with more than 330000 new cases diagnosed worldwide in 2022. In the U.S. skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancer diagnosed and melanoma accounts for a large majority of skin cancer deaths. It is estimated there will be more than 100000 new cases of melanoma diagnosed and more than 8000 deaths resulting from the disease in the U.S. in 2024.

About Merck’s early-stage cancer clinical program

Finding cancer at an earlier stage may give patients a greater chance of long-term survival. Many cancers are considered most treatable and potentially curable in their earliest stage of disease. Building on the strong understanding of the role of KEYTRUDA in later-stage cancers Merck is studying KEYTRUDA in earlier disease states with more than 25 ongoing registrational studies across multiple types of cancer.

About vibostolimab

Vibostolimab (MK-7684) is an investigational humanized anti-TIGIT antibody discovered and developed by Merck. Vibostolimab restores antitumor activity by blocking the TIGIT receptor from binding to its ligands (CD112 and CD155) thereby activating T lymphocytes that help destroy tumor cells. The coformulation of vibostolimab and pembrolizumab and is being evaluated in a wide range of cancers including lung other solid tumors and blood cancers.

About KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) injection 100 mg

KEYTRUDA is an anti-programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) therapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight tumor cells. KEYTRUDA is a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands PD- L1 and PD-L2 thereby activating T lymphocytes which may affect both tumor cells and healthy cells.

Merck has the industry’s largest immuno-oncology clinical research program. There are currently more than 1600 trials studying KEYTRUDA across a wide variety of cancers and treatment settings. The KEYTRUDA clinical program seeks to understand the role of KEYTRUDA across cancers and the factors that may predict a patient's likelihood of benefitting from treatment with KEYTRUDA including exploring several different biomarkers.

Selected KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) Indications in the U.S.

KEYTRUDA is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of adult and pediatric (12 years and older) patients with stage IIB IIC or III melanoma following complete resection.

See additional selected KEYTRUDA indications in the U.S. after the Selected Important Safety Information.

Selected Important Safety Information for KEYTRUDA

Severe and Fatal Immune-Mediated Adverse Reactions

KEYTRUDA is a monoclonal antibody that belongs to a class of drugs that bind to either the PD-1 or the PD-L1 blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway thereby removing inhibition of the immune response potentially breaking peripheral tolerance and inducing immune-mediated adverse reactions. Immune-mediated adverse reactions which may be severe or fatal can occur in any organ system or tissue can affect more than one body system simultaneously and can occur at any time after starting treatment or after discontinuation of treatment. Important immune-mediated adverse reactions listed here may not include all possible severe and fatal immune-mediated adverse reactions.

Monitor patients closely for symptoms and signs that may be clinical manifestations of underlying immune-mediated adverse reactions. Early identification and management are essential to ensure safe use of anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Evaluate liver enzymes creatinine and thyroid function at baseline and periodically during treatment. For patients with TNBC treated with KEYTRUDA in the neoadjuvant setting monitor blood cortisol at baseline prior to surgery and as clinically indicated. In cases of suspected immune-mediated adverse reactions initiate appropriate workup to exclude alternative etiologies including infection. Institute medical management promptly including specialty consultation as appropriate.

Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity of the immune-mediated adverse reaction. In general if KEYTRUDA requires interruption or discontinuation administer systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent) until improvement to Grade 1 or less. Upon improvement to Grade 1 or less initiate corticosteroid taper and continue to taper over at least 1 month. Consider administration of other systemic immunosuppressants in patients whose adverse reactions are not controlled with corticosteroid therapy.

Immune-Mediated Pneumonitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated pneumonitis. The incidence is higher in patients who have received prior thoracic radiation. Immune-mediated pneumonitis occurred in 3.4% (94/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA including fatal (0.1%) Grade 4 (0.3%) Grade 3 (0.9%) and Grade 2 (1.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 67% (63/94) of patients. Pneumonitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 1.3% (36) and withholding in 0.9% (26) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these 23% had recurrence. Pneumonitis resolved in 59% of the 94 patients.

Pneumonitis occurred in 8% (31/389) of adult patients with cHL receiving KEYTRUDA as a single agent including Grades 3-4 in 2.3% of patients. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 2 days to 53 months). Pneumonitis rates were similar in patients with and without prior thoracic radiation. Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 5.4% (21) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis 42% interrupted KEYTRUDA 68% discontinued KEYTRUDA and 77% had resolution.

Pneumonitis occurred in 7% (41/580) of adult patients with resected NSCLC who received KEYTRUDA as a single agent for adjuvant treatment of NSCLC including fatal (0.2%) Grade 4 (0.3%) and Grade 3 (1%) adverse reactions. Patients received high-dose corticosteroids for a median duration of 10 days (range: 1 day to 2.3 months). Pneumonitis led to discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 26 (4.5%) of patients. Of the patients who developed pneumonitis 54% interrupted KEYTRUDA 63% discontinued KEYTRUDA and 71% had resolution.

Immune-Mediated Colitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated colitis which may present with diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus infection/reactivation has been reported in patients with corticosteroid-refractory immune-mediated colitis. In cases of corticosteroid-refractory colitis consider repeating infectious workup to exclude alternative etiologies. Immune-mediated colitis occurred in 1.7% (48/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA including Grade 4 (<0.1%) Grade 3 (1.1%) and Grade 2 (0.4%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 69% (33/48); additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 4.2% of patients. Colitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.5% (15) and withholding in 0.5% (13) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these 23% had recurrence. Colitis resolved in 85% of the 48 patients.

Hepatotoxicity and Immune-Mediated Hepatitis

KEYTRUDA as a Single Agent

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hepatitis. Immune-mediated hepatitis occurred in 0.7% (19/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA including Grade 4 (<0.1%) Grade 3 (0.4%) and Grade 2 (0.1%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 68% (13/19) of patients; additional immunosuppressant therapy was required in 11% of patients. Hepatitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.2% (6) and withholding in 0.3% (9) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement; of these none had recurrence. Hepatitis resolved in 79% of the 19 patients.

KEYTRUDA With Axitinib

KEYTRUDA in combination with axitinib can cause hepatic toxicity. Monitor liver enzymes before initiation of and periodically throughout treatment. Consider monitoring more frequently as compared to when the drugs are administered as single agents. For elevated liver enzymes interrupt KEYTRUDA and axitinib and consider administering corticosteroids as needed. With the combination of KEYTRUDA and axitinib Grades 3 and 4 increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (20%) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (13%) were seen at a higher frequency compared to KEYTRUDA alone. Fifty-nine percent of the patients with increased ALT received systemic corticosteroids. In patients with ALT ≥3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) (Grades 2-4 n=116) ALT resolved to Grades 0-1 in 94%. Among the 92 patients who were rechallenged with either KEYTRUDA (n=3) or axitinib (n=34) administered as a single agent or with both (n=55) recurrence of ALT ≥3 times ULN was observed in 1 patient receiving KEYTRUDA 16 patients receiving axitinib and 24 patients receiving both. All patients with a recurrence of ALT ≥3 ULN subsequently recovered from the event.

Immune-Mediated Endocrinopathies

Adrenal Insufficiency

KEYTRUDA can cause primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency. For Grade 2 or higher initiate symptomatic treatment including hormone replacement as clinically indicated. Withhold KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 0.8% (22/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA including Grade 4 (<0.1%) Grade 3 (0.3%) and Grade 2 (0.3%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 77% (17/22) of patients; of these the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Adrenal insufficiency led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.3% (8) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.

Hypophysitis

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated hypophysitis. Hypophysitis can present with acute symptoms associated with mass effect such as headache photophobia or visual field defects. Hypophysitis can cause hypopituitarism. Initiate hormone replacement as indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Hypophysitis occurred in 0.6% (17/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA including Grade 4 (<0.1%) Grade 3 (0.3%) and Grade 2 (0.2%) reactions. Systemic corticosteroids were required in 94% (16/17) of patients; of these the majority remained on systemic corticosteroids. Hypophysitis led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in 0.1% (4) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.

Thyroid Disorders

KEYTRUDA can cause immune-mediated thyroid disorders. Thyroiditis can present with or without endocrinopathy. Hypothyroidism can follow hyperthyroidism. Initiate hormone replacement for hypothyroidism or institute medical management of hyperthyroidism as clinically indicated. Withhold or permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA depending on severity. Thyroiditis occurred in 0.6% (16/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA including Grade 2 (0.3%). None discontinued but KEYTRUDA was withheld in <0.1% (1) of patients.

Hyperthyroidism occurred in 3.4% (96/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (0.8%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (2) and withholding in 0.3% (7) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement. Hypothyroidism occurred in 8% (237/2799) of patients receiving KEYTRUDA including Grade 3 (0.1%) and Grade 2 (6.2%). It led to permanent discontinuation of KEYTRUDA in <0.1% (1) and withholding in 0.5% (14) of patients. All patients who were withheld reinitiated KEYTRUDA after symptom improvement.

Cardiac/Vascular: Myocarditis pericarditis vasculitis; Nervous System: Meningitis encephalitis myelitis and demyelination myasthenic syndrome/myasthenia gravis (including exacerbation) Guillain-Barré syndrome nerve paresis autoimmune neuropathy; Ocular: Uveitis iritis and other ocular inflammatory toxicities can occur. Some cases can be associated with retinal detachment. Various grades of visual impairment including blindness can occur. If uveitis occurs in combination with other immune-mediated adverse reactions consider a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada-like syndrome as this may require treatment with systemic steroids to reduce the risk of permanent vision loss; Gastrointestinal: Pancreatitis to include increases in serum amylase and lipase levels gastritis duodenitis; Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue: Myositis/polymyositis rhabdomyolysis (and associated sequelae including renal failure) arthritis (1.5%) polymyalgia rheumatica; Endocrine: Hypoparathyroidism; Hematologic/Immune: Hemolytic anemia aplastic anemia hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis systemic inflammatory response syndrome histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi lymphadenitis) sarcoidosis immune thrombocytopenic purpura solid organ transplant rejection other transplant (including corneal graft) rejection.

Infusion-Related Reactions

KEYTRUDA can cause severe or life-threatening infusion-related reactions including hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis which have been reported in 0.2% of 2799 patients receiving KEYTRUDA.

For Grade 3 or Grade 4 reactions stop infusion and permanently discontinue KEYTRUDA.

Complications of Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT)

Fatal and other serious complications can occur in patients who receive allogeneic HSCT before or after anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments. Transplant-related complications include hyperacute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) acute and chronic GVHD hepatic veno-occlusive disease after reduced intensity conditioning and steroid-requiring febrile syndrome (without an identified infectious cause). These complications may occur despite intervening therapy between anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment and allogeneic HSCT. Follow patients closely for evidence of these complications and intervene promptly. Consider the benefit vs risks of using anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatments prior to or after an allogeneic HSCT.

Increased Mortality in Patients With Multiple Myeloma

In trials in patients with multiple myeloma the addition of KEYTRUDA to a thalidomide analogue plus dexamethasone resulted in increased mortality. Treatment of these patients with an anti–PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in this combination is not recommended outside of controlled trials.

Embryofetal Toxicity

Based on its mechanism of action KEYTRUDA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise women of this potential risk. In females of reproductive potential verify pregnancy status prior to initiating KEYTRUDA and advise them to use effective contraception during treatment and for 4 months after the last dose.

Nfl Ny Jets Vs Detroit Lions Lions At Jets

After a tumultuous season in which he was benched multiple times for his performance Zach Wilson’s days in New York no longer appeared to be numbered.

In a recent article in The Athletic NFL insider Jeff Howe revealed that the Jets don’t intend to trade Wilson despite his shortcomings. Obviously that could change if New York receives an offer it cannot refuse but Howe’s current reporting indicates that Wilson’s staying put — for now.

“The Jets don’t intend to trade their 2021 first-round pick because there’s hope he can develop while learning more in a backup capacity” Howe wrote.

Howe also reported what many others in the industry have already stated that the Jets “remain poised to acquire a veteran quarterback this offseason to take over the starting job.” The names to watch — Aaron Rodgers Jimmy Garoppolo and Derek Carr — shouldn’t come as a surprise at this current junction.

While the Jets have seemingly mishandled Wilson’s development it’s clear that the organization still believes that he’s talented enough to be salvaged. The Jets drafted Wilson with the No. 2 overall pick in the 2021 NFL Draft hoping that he’d be the organization’s franchise quarterback for years to come but he hasn’t developed as quickly as the talent around him.

With Wilson due to make $3.855 million in 2023 he could serve as a low-cost backup theoretically developing behind a veteran starter. The Jets are ready to win now and need a quarterback who matches that timeline. Nathaniel Hackett who was recently hired to replace Mike LaFleur as New York’s offensive coordinator will likely be tasked with Wilson’s development from here on out.

It remains to be seen whether or not the BYU product can be a capable NFL starter.

Posted on: February 5 2023 04:15h.

Last updated on: October 7 2023 01:05h.

The MGM Grand Las Vegas isn’t just the largest casino in Sin City. It’s the largest individual hotel building in the world according to the World Record Academy.

The Academy which logs a variety of business and personal records notes MGM Grand sits on 6.6 acres commanding 380000 square feet making it the largest hotel structure in the world.

(MGM Grand) has 6852 rooms and includes five outdoor pools rivers and waterfalls that cover 6.6 acres (2.7 ha) a 380000 square feet (35000 m2) convention center the MGM Grand Garden Arena and the Grand Spa; it also houses numerous shops night clubs restaurants and the largest casino in Clark County which occupies 171500 square feet (15930 m2)” notes the Academy.

By number of rooms MGM Grand is not the largest hotel in the world. That distinction belongs to the First World Hotel in Malaysia which has 7351 rooms.

MGM Grand History

MGM Grand opened on the Strip in December 1993 and cost an estimated $1.1 billion to build.

In January 2020 MGM announced the sale of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand to a joint venture controlled by MGM Growth Properties (MGP) and Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust (BREIT). At that time the breakdown was a 50.1% stake to MGP with BREIT owning the remainder.

That 50.1% was inherited by VICI Properties when it closed its $17.2 billion acquisition of MGM Growth in April 2022 — a transaction that created the largest gaming REIT in the US as well as the largest landlord on the Strip.

Last December VICI announced it would acquire the remaining 49.9% of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand for $4.27 billion as BREIT faced a liquidity crunch. That figure includes a cash consideration of $1.27 billion and the assumption of $3 billion in BREIT debt.

Translation: VICI Properties owns the real estate of MGM Grand while MGM Resorts remains the operator of the integrated resort. Another point worth noting: MGM Grand is the largest single hotel complex in the US. Overall the biggest is the combined Venetian and Palazzo — also on the Strip and owned by VICI.

Other Las Vegas Accolades

In addition to the MGM Grand’s accolades some others from the World Record Academy pertain to Las Vegas and Nevada.

The Academy says the Bonanza Gift Shop located on the Las Vegas Strip between the Sahara Las Vegas and the Strat is the world’s largest store of its kind. The world’s largest fireworks structure is found in Amargosa Valley Nevada. The 28-foot tall “M-800” firecracker covers a water tank.

As for the world’s largest hotels ranked by the number of rooms eleven of the top 20 including MGM Grand and all US-based venues are located in Las Vegas. That group also includes the Venetian Wynn and Encore Caesars Palace and MGM’s Aria among others. Las Vegas Sands’ Londoner Macau ranks by the number of rooms.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlbmV2YWRhaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvd2l0aC1sYXMtdmVnYXMtaW4tdGhlLXBhc3Qtc2FuZHMtc2V0cy1zaWdodHMtb24tbmV3LXlvcmstYW5kLXRleGFz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,With Las Vegas in the past Sands sets sights on New York and Texas,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlbmV2YWRhaW5kZXBlbmRlbnQuY29tL2FydGljbGUvd2l0aC1sYXMtdmVnYXMtaW4tdGhlLXBhc3Qtc2FuZHMtc2V0cy1zaWdodHMtb24tbmV3LXlvcmstYW5kLXRleGFz0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025625B502E0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Las Vegas is the undisputed center of the gaming industry universe but New York is making a bid to grab its share of attention this year.

Friday was the first of several key deadlines as the state forges ahead in its effort to award three downstate casino licenses in the Empire State. For us West Coasters downstate is defined as the New York City area and the counties of Nassau Putnam Rockland Suffolk and Westchester.

In 2013 the New York Constitution was amended to authorize up to seven commercial casinos in the state. State officials sited four destination casino resorts in upstate New York. Nine years later in 2022 lawmakers established a new siting process and criteria for the remaining three licenses. It’s a competitive process that is being overseen by the New York Gaming Commission and its three-member Gaming Facility Location Board.

Request for applications

That board in January distributed a 70-page “Request for Applications” document that has caught the attention of the biggest companies in gaming. Even before the formal release of the RFA gaming companies began positioning themselves with partners to apply for licensing.

The New York Gaming Commission has made it clear that it’s interested in an integrated resort with plenty of nongaming amenities.

The RFA says each applicant is required to submit a $1 million fee to apply and the board will require a minimum $500 million investment in the resort. Once the winners have been selected the license will cost $500 million plus annual fees of $750 per slot machine or table game installed. Licenses will be good for a minimum of 10 years and a maximum of 30 years.

The first deadline involved the submission of questions by prospective applicants and were due Friday. The board hasn’t announced when its responses will be available but 30 days after questions are asked and answered a second question period will occur.

The board hasn’t set a timeline for the next step which will include requirements to conduct public hearings by six-member community advisory committees composed of elected officials. No deadline has been set for formal submission of proposals.

So it’s a long process that may take a good portion of 2023 to complete. And while the price of admission is steep the rewards will be handsome because of the limited competition.

The major competitors

Several Las Vegas companies are involved in the process. Here are some of the details that have been made public on bids for the three casinos:

* Analysts say two companies may have an inside track for being awarded a license because they already have operations at New York-area racinos — horse-racing tracks that have slot-machine casinos attached to them. New York lawmakers authorized slot machines at tracks in 2001. Genting Group’s Resorts World New York City is attached to the Aqueduct Racetrack and opened in 2011 with more than 6500 slot machines. That’s the same company that operates Resorts World Las Vegas. Resorts World also operates an upstate casino in New York in the Catskills. The Empire City Casino at Yonkers Raceway is operated by MGM Resorts International and has around 5000 slot machines and automated tables in a racing environment.

* Las Vegas Sands Corp. is bidding for a license after it entered an agreement to acquire the long-term lease of the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum on Long Island. The Long Island development would include outdoor community spaces four- and five-star hotel rooms and a live performance venue honoring the legacy of live music at the coliseum. The company said the resort would also feature celebrity chef restaurants experiential events and venues and flexible meeting and convention space including ballrooms. Its casino gaming offering would represent less than 10 percent of the project’s total square footage. There are also plans to have a day spa swimming pool and health club. Sands has a lengthy track record of developing integrated resorts as the market leader in Macao and in Singapore where it operates the iconic Marina Bay Sands resort.

* Caesars Entertainment Inc. announced a partnership with New York office landlord SL Green Realty Corp. to open Caesars Palace Times Square in an existing skyscraper. The 54-story tower is owned by SL Green and the new Caesars Palace would be designed to include a Broadway theater for “The Lion King” according to a news release. It said the development would bring Caesars’ 50-plus years of “globally-recognized excellence” in entertainment food and beverage and gaming “to deliver a best-in-class experience that will be authentic and complementary to the Times Square entertainment district.”

* Wynn Resorts Ltd. is partnering with New York real estate heavyweight Related Companies at its Hudson Yards development in Manhattan. A release issued by Wynn said the property would be a resort entertainment and gaming destination along the Hudson River and it would be near the Javits Center one of New York’s busiest convention centers. Wynn prides itself in providing a quality product and has two resorts on the Strip three in Macao and one in suburban Boston.

* New York’s Major League Baseball teams are in collaborations for resorts. Mets owner Steve Cohen is looking at building a casino near the team’s CitiField stadium at Willets Point. New York media outlets earlier reported Cohen was in discussions with Sands but it appears now that he has aligned with the Seminole Tribe of Florida’s Hard Rock International the recent buyer of The Mirage on the Strip. Meanwhile New York Yankees affiliate Legends Hospitality is reportedly collaborating with Saratoga Casino and Raceway operators of a harness-racing track; Thor Equities a real estate investment firm; and the Chickasaw Nation tribe whose members operate casinos in Oklahoma to build a casino at the beachfront boardwalk at Coney Island.

* Vornado Realty Trust is reportedly eyeing the development of a casino at the soon-to-be-demolished Hotel Pennsylvania near Penn Station. A Vornado spokesman told New York media it has no development partnership in place but analysts have speculated it could team up with Chicago-based Rush Street Gaming which has expressed interest in entering the New York market.

Random prompts and popups within Windows 11 and Windows 10 asking you to do something and there being no immediate or obvious way to decline said offer or request. It happens a lot across different platforms and devices but for whatever reason I notice it most on Windows.

Maybe it’s because every THREE days a full-screen non-closable blindingly white prompt appears asking me if I’d like to finish setting up my PC with Office 365 or Windows Phone Link (both of which I’m already using) with the only options presented being “Remind me in 3 days” or “Continue” to go through the process of setting up things I don’t want or need to setup.

Let's finish setting up your device prompt (Image credit: Microsoft)

You’ve all seen this screen at least once before too. Whether you’re on Windows 10 or Windows 11 this screen has consistently appeared in one form or another over the last handful of years and it’s so incredibly frustrating. What’s worse is this isn’t the only place where Microsoft isn’t allowing users to say no.

Still on Windows 10 and aren’t interested in Windows 11? You’ve almost definitely seen this prompt that asks you to “download and install” Windows 11 or “Stay on Windows 10 for now.” FOR NOW? How about FOR EVER? What if I never want to upgrade this PC to Windows 11? Are you going to continue asking me to upgrade for the rest of eternity? Let me say no.

Just a few days ago this video popped up on Reddit showing off a full-screen prompt for subscribing to Office where the “No thanks” button would progress you to filling out your credit card information for a free trial just in case you change your mind. That’s seriously something that was happening for a bit. Some people assume this was a bug but I think that’s giving Microsoft too much credit.

OneDrive backup prompt (Image credit: Microsoft)

Microsoft also recently started testing new user alert prompts in the Start menu which will pop suggestions related to your account. The screenshot they use to demo this? A prompt for setting up OneDrive backups with the options presented being “Start backup” and you guessed it “Remind me later.” Just let me say NO.

The only place where “remind me later” makes sense is with monthly Windows OS updates. You should all be installing those updates as they bring fixes and security patches that are vital for a device connected to the internet. Avoiding them is a mistake so this is the only place where I understand using the “remind me later” trope instead of allowing the user to outright decline.

But for everything else it’s unacceptable and annoying. If I wanted to setup those features I’d have already done so. Heck in some cases I already have! And as it turns out there is a way to turn off (at least some) of these annoying popups.

Hidden deep in Windows Settings are three options that will reduce the amount of popups asking you to do things that you don’t want. In the future I’d prefer being able to turn these options off straight from the UI that pops up to begin with but this here is better than nothing. Here’s how to do it:

Microsoft was once the creator of the world's most popular internet browser but the time when everyone used Internet Explorer has long since passed. In an attempt to recapture its previous web browsing relevance the company launched Microsoft Edge. The browser has undergone a constant string of upgrades in the years since including one that shifted it to Google's Chromium platform (via Microsoft). With the same basic platform as the current most popular browser and a whole host of features with more being added as time went on Edge has everything it needs to be a success.

There is however a slight problem: people hate it. In a SlashGear poll Edge came very low down in the popularity rankings averaging just over 6%. This puts it way behind Chrome which topped the list at 56% and lagging well behind Apple's homegrown effort Safari which 27% of readers said they use. It even lagged behind Firefox which has its own string of problems.

As far as the source of the vitriol it's a little complicated. Part of it is ancestral or as ancestral as a product made by a 47-year-old software company can get. Other people hate it because of Microsoft's forceful marketing practices. If you're not in the two main groups don't worry there's a far longer list of reasons why people are swerving Edge. Why despite Microsoft's best efforts do people have a very strong dislike for the company's premier browser?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndpbmRvd3NsYXRlc3QuY29tLzIwMjMvMDIvMDQvd2luZG93cy0xMC1pbnN0YWxsYXRpb24tYnVnLWFjY2lkZW50YWxseS1mb3JjZXMtdXNlcnMtdG8tYnV5LW1pY3Jvc29mdC0zNjUv0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cud2luZG93c2xhdGVzdC5jb20vMjAyMy8wMi8wNC93aW5kb3dzLTEwLWluc3RhbGxhdGlvbi1idWctYWNjaWRlbnRhbGx5LWZvcmNlcy11c2Vycy10by1idXktbWljcm9zb2Z0LTM2NS9hbXAv?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Windows 10 installation bug accidentally forces users to buy Microsoft 365,"Windows 10 has again started displaying a full-screen pop-up that takes up the whole screen (similar to the first boot experience) and attempts to sell Microsoft 365. The pop-up itself isn’t new but there’s a catch – a bug in Windows 11 22H2 prevents users from skipping the Microsoft 365 offer which means they’re asked to enter credit card details.

The full-screen nag which is occasionally pushed by the company once in a while attempts to promote Microsoft services such as OneDrive and Microsoft 365. This is part of the company’s efforts to make “Windows even better” by helping customers discover the abovementioned services.

It also attempts to link your Android phone to Windows 10 and pushes users to sign in to their Microsoft account. As mentioned at the outset Windows 10’s full-screen pop-ups have been around for years and were first spotted in 2018 when the company enthusiastically hoped to hook up your PC and account with other Microsoft services.

Microsoft has shipped Windows 10 22H2 with an undocumented bug where users could be forced to enter their credit card details for Microsoft 365 trial.

When you’re on the setup screen or “first boot experience” screen you’ll have two options for Microsoft 365 offer – “Try for free” and “No thanks”. The “No thanks” button should ideally skip the Microsoft 365 registration and proceed to the next screen but there’s a bug where the “No thanks” button opens the registration window.

A Microsoft source who wished to remain anonymous confirmed that this move isn’t intentional and is a bug. The company accidentally switched over the strings for “No thanks” with “Try for free”. In other words the try it button is actually “No thanks” and “No thanks” is a sign-up button.

“The buttons are simply flipped due to a bug” a source confirmed. You can go back to the previous screen and skip the offer by selecting the other button. Or you can always disconnect from the internet when setting up Windows 10.

Microsoft has yet to acknowledge the problem but we expect it to be fixed in a future cumulative update.

For those unaware Windows 10 is supported until at least October 2025 and it will continue to receive features and improvements including a fix for this particular issue highlighted above.

In related news Microsoft is experimenting with a full-screen popup to convince users to try Windows 11 for free. The full-screen popup has four slides attempting to promote Windows 11’s new flagship features such as the Start menu and redesigned notification center.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDIvMDQvYW1hem9uLWdvb2dsZS1taWNyb3NvZnQtc2hvdy1zbG93aW5nLWdyb3d0aC1pbi1jbG91ZC1pbmZyYXN0cnVjdHVyZS5odG1s0gFsaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjMvMDIvMDQvYW1hem9uLWdvb2dsZS1taWNyb3NvZnQtc2hvdy1zbG93aW5nLWdyb3d0aC1pbi1jbG91ZC1pbmZyYXN0cnVjdHVyZS5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cloud leaders Amazon Google and Microsoft show the once-booming market is cooling down,"As growth in traditional tech equipment and software slowed to a trickle in recent years cloud computing gobbled up spending reflecting a dramatic change in how companies were choosing to run applications and store data.

But in the past two weeks the biggest names in cloud infrastructure issued clear warnings to suggest that the frenetic expansion of the past half-decade is cooling. Historically high inflation and a steady increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve have led businesses to curtail spending and seek ways to get more out of their existing infrastructure.

Amazon  Microsoft and Alphabet  the three leaders in the market for cloud-based storage and servers all reported deceleration in their respective businesses. On Thursday Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud which also includes Workplace productivity software showed revenue for the fourth quarter that was below analysts' estimates.

""In Q4 we saw slower growth of consumption as customers optimized GCP cost reflecting the macro backdrop"" Ruth Porat Alphabet's chief financial officer told analysts on the earnings call.

Google Cloud revenue growth slowed to 32% in the fourth quarter from almost 38% in the third period. Revenue of $7.32 billion trailed analysts estimates of $7.43 billion according to StreetAccount.

Amazon  which pioneered the market over 15 years ago and maintains a commanding lead said AWS revenue growth decelerated to 20% from 27%. The unit notched sales of $21.4 billion while analysts were projecting $21.87 billion. As recently as 2018 AWS was growing over 45%.

Brian Olsavsky Amazon's finance chief told analysts that large companies worked with AWS in the fourth quarter to trim their spending because of the difficult economy a trend that started in the middle of the third quarter. He's not expecting it to reverse anytime soon.

""As we look ahead we expect these optimization efforts will continue to be a headwind to AWS growth in at least the next couple of quarters"" Olsavsky said.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy who started AWS with company founder Jeff Bezos and ran the division until taking the helm at the parent company in 2021 spoke up later on the call to tout the robust pipeline of cloud migrations. However according to a regulatory filing customers are showing less confidence in longer-term deals. Amazon reported $110.4 billion in commitments on contracts with original terms longer than one year. That was up 37% from a prior year a decline from 57% growth in the third quarter.

Analysts at Bank of America lowered their forecast for AWS and now expect growth for the year of 11% instead of 15%. That would be down from nearly 29% in 2022.

""We see LT cloud trajectory as bent and not broken"" wrote the analysts who have a buy rating on the stock.

Results from Alphabet and Amazon follow Microsoft's report last week. Microsoft's Azure unit is second in cloud infrastructure to AWS."

Mr. Servitje made the observation in response to a question from an investment analyst about the lack of large acquisitions by Bimbo in recent years. The analyst asked whether Bimbo was now either focused on smaller acquisitions or was reaching “the point where it’s about to maybe return some of that cash to shareholders.”

“We still see a lot of opportunities in the grain-based foods business in which we are” Mr. Servitje said. “So definitely our business is not local. It’s not only Mexico or US. It’s global. And the way we are organized we see that we still have a lot of opportunities for organic and also from non-organic growth. And that’s why we are continually looking at opportunities on both ends. But having said that we will remain also reasonable in terms of what can we digest.”

Diego Gaxiola chief financial officer said that while Bimbo would continue seeking acquisition opportunities and remained committed to investing in capital expenditures to maintain and enhance productivity Bimbo also has returned dollars to shareholders. He noted that the company on April 26 declared a dividend that represented a 20% increase in the payout rate and also issued an extraordinary dividend in connection with its sale of Ricolino to Mondelez International Inc. in April 2022.

The Bimbo executives were upbeat about the company’s first-quarter financial results. While earnings were down in the quarter ended March 31 the company’s leaders saw considerable cause to be encouraged. Total Grupo Bimbo sales in the quarter jumped 9.9% and fell just shy of 100 billion pesos reaching 99.6 billion.

“We kicked off the year with a very strong first quarter” Mr. Servitje said. “We continue to see the benefit from the pricing strategy implemented during 2022 which enabled us to surpass our expectations and last year’s results. Our sales reached historic levels for the first quarter. Our EBITDA margin closed at 12.9%.”

Operating income of the North America business of Grupo Bimbo SAB de CV was 2.77 billion pesos ($154 million) down 30% from 3.96 billion pesos in the first quarter of 2022. Operating margin was 5.9% down 280 basis points from 8.7% in the first quarter of 2022. Sales were 47.2 billion pesos ($2.6 billion) up 4.3% from 45.3 billion pesos in the first quarter the year before.

Bimbo said higher costs of sales and an inflationary environment put pressure on margins. Operating income also was boosted a year earlier by a $73 million non-cash benefit connected with multi-employer pension plans.

Bimbo said the company benefited from strong sales performance and lower distribution and administrative expenses.

Net sales in North America were up 15% in US dollars mostly reflecting higher prices.

“The premium bread and snacks categories outperformed” Bimbo said. “This was partially offset by a difficult comparison from the Omicron surge effect during the first quarter of 2022.”

Adjusted EBITDA in North America was 4.87 billion pesos ($270 million) up 4.8% from 4.65 billion a year earlier. BBU’s adjusted EBITDA margin was 10.3% unchanged from the year before. The adjusted EBITDA figure which excludes the effect of MEPPs rose mostly because of sales gains and productivity savings “across the value chain” Bimbo said.

“North America margin remained flat mainly due to the strong sales performance and a favorable price and product mix effect which was offset by a higher inflationary environment including commodities and labor costs” Bimbo said.

Of the North American business Mr. Servitje said “North America delivered strong top-line performance growing 15% in dollar terms mainly due to the carryover pricing effect since we experienced a volume pressure as we cycled last year’s Omicron surge. Despite the challenging inflationary environment and a difficult comparison base we were able to maintain our adjusted EBITDA margin at 10.3%.”

Mr. Servitje cited an “ongoing difficult labor environment” among challenges the company was facing. While Bimbo did not share figures on volume during the quarter Mr. Servitje implied they were under pressure.

“We are still expecting a solid 2023 more specifically in the back half of the year” he said. “We hope we’ll start to see volumes improving as we cycle the price increases as well as realized productivity benefits throughout our business.”

Addressing a question about a steep drop in commodity prices relative to a year ago Mark Bendix president of Grupo Bimbo reminded the analyst that Bimbo employs forward hedging complicating the year-to-year comparison.

“But our business has really remained resilient” Mr. Bendix said. “Obviously you’ve seen we’ve delivered another strong quarter but we still have to be vigilant about mitigating inflation. So that includes looking at strong execution cost savings initiatives and initiatives to have productivity improvement in everything we do. And then tying in with your extended question this is well experiencing elasticity that’s well below historical levels.”

Mr. Bendix said Bimbo expects lower commodity costs in the second half of 2023 but added that pressure on the company’s sales has not been evident.

“We did see some trade down to private label that has flattened out” Mr. Bendix said. “But I would tell you that we’re seeing consumers still under pressure because of inflation. But we’re also still seeing really nice growth in our premium products and snacks. So we need to be vigilant and continue to look and see but it hasn’t been the migration that you necessarily would have expected to private label and we’ve all been a little bit surprised by that.”

Grupo Bimbo net majority income in the first quarter was 4.05 billion pesos ($225 million) down 9% from 4.47 billion a year earlier. The decrease was attributed to the MEPPs benefit in the first quarter of 2022 together with the profit from the Ricolino’s discontinued operation in 2022. Adjusted for these items net majority income in the first quarter was 42% and the company’s profit margin widened by 90 basis points to 4.1%. Net sales were 99.6 billion pesos ($5.5 billion) up 10% from 90.6 billion in the first quarter of 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3J0aGplcnNleS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9iZXJnZW4vMjAyMy8wMi8wNC9kZXZlbG9wZXItd2lsbC1yZXBsYWNlLW5hYmlzY28tZmFjdG9yeS1pbi1iZXJnZW4tY291bnR5LXdpdGgtd2FyZWhvdXNlLzY5ODcxMDA2MDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Developer will replace Nabisco factory in Bergen County with warehouse,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMijAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ub3J0aGplcnNleS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy9iZXJnZW4vMjAyMy8wMi8wNC9kZXZlbG9wZXItd2lsbC1yZXBsYWNlLW5hYmlzY28tZmFjdG9yeS1pbi1iZXJnZW4tY291bnR5LXdpdGgtd2FyZWhvdXNlLzY5ODcxMDA2MDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000256268500D0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Cadbury 5Star has launched a campaign to help singles navigate through the love-sick zones and dodge gushy couples.The campaign begins with a guy who is about to munch Cadbury 5Star when he gets interrupted by the famous romantic tune of all time and he suddenly remembers it is Valentine ’s day. Attempting to find a secluded spot to sit and enjoy his Cadbury 5Star chocolate he gets disturbed again by lots of couples who are looking for the same quiet place and this becomes overwhelming for him to enjoy his time alone on Valentine’s day.Keeping in mind the predicament of the singles Cadbury 5Star has launched a mush detector web app which tracks the couples purchase of chocolates for each other their usual go to places and processes that data with Artificial Intelligence to let them see all the mush in the area around them so they can escape all the mush and do the best thing to do on Valentine’s day which is Eat 5Star. “ Do Nothing ” in mush free zones.As part of this year’s #DoNothing proposition the brand has introduced a mush detector web app that detects high mush zones thus helping free birds ‘ Do Nothing ’ in peace.Nitin Saini vice president-marketing Mondelez India said“ Creating yet another engaging narrative for Gen Z our latest edition of Valentine’s Day campaign stands for all those who do not celebrate Valentine’s Day and willhelp them steer clear of any mush anywhere. With a resounding response to last year’s Valentine’s Day campaign we are confident that this year’s efforts will resonate equally well with our consumers.”.Sukesh Kumar Nayak chief creative officer Ogilvy India added ‘Valentine’s Day has become an annual event for Cadbury 5 Star to leverage and land its 'Do Nothing' counter-culture attitude. This year we have conceived and built a zany dynamic webapp the 5 Star mush detector - which helps people detect and avoid mush around them with a real-time map using various data points like nearby florists gift shops movie theatres restaurants etc. What makes it even more irreverent is that the data is also triangulated with chocolate sales to deduce mush.”Shekhar Banerjee- chief client officer and office head- west Wavemaker India further added “This campaign has been mounted on the back of exclusive partnerships with brands like Frozen Bottle Keventers and Smaaash to create mush free zones for singles to hang around while escaping the mush! In collaboration with popular faces that celebrate ‘singlehood’ we had a very unique use of hyperlocal targeting we are alerting singles about the mushy areas to avoid warning them to escape these zones through the mush detector app .”Watch video here:",,,

Look no further than the recent surge in any stock associated with the letters “AI.” If ChatGPT is churning out amusing copy it must be a great time to buy “AI stocks” right? Never mind doing any due diligence just search for company names that contain AI. A similar behavior was observed nearly two decades ago when companies with “nano” in the name soared to the moon.

Then there’s the often repeated mistake of ticker confusion which isn’t just about fat fingering the wrong ticker. Researchers have shown remarkable return profiles associated with tickers that look the same. From an article by Quartz:

One spectacular example was when as the researchers document the stock price of Tweeter Home Entertainment Group surged by more than 1000% on Oct. 4 2013.

The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has given approval for Morgan Stanley to take a controlling stake in its fund management firm Morgan Stanley Huaxin Fund Management Co read an announcement on Friday.The move represents the latest effort in advancing the opening-up of China's capital market which has been progressing smoothly over the past two years.The CSRC said that Morgan Stanley International Holdings Inc can invest 127.5 million yuan ($18.92 million) in the fund management firm giving it a 51 percent stake.The Shenzhen-headquartered fund management company was jointly set up by Morgan Stanley and its partner Huaxin Securities in 2008 according to the company's official site.Also on Friday Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) stated that it had obtained approval from China's securities regulator for the establishment of Standard Chartered Securities Co its securities branch.The move will make Standard Chartered Securities the first wholly foreign-owned securities company to be set up since the removal of restrictions on foreign shareholding in securities companies in 2020 the company said.With an initial capital injection of 1.05 billion yuan the new firm will cover underwriting asset management - restricted to asset-backed securities only - own-account trading and brokerage activities.China scrapped foreign ownership limits in almost all areas of its $45 trillion financial sector from April 1 2020. Eligible foreign investors have since then filed applications for the establishment or change of the actual controller of securities firms in accordance with related laws and regulations.China will unswervingly expand the opening-up of its financial industry and cultivate a high-class environment for market entities a Chinese official said at the 2022 Financial Street Forum in Beijing in November last year.China has introduced more than 50 financial reform and opening-up policies since 2018 and more than 120 foreign banking and insurance institutions have opened in China during the period Zhou Liang vice chairman of China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) said in a parallel session at the forum.The official vowed to further promote the opening-up of the financial industry with a more proactive attitude more diversified open market landscape higher quality environment and a safer system.Global Times",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzQ1NjJjM2UzLTMzM2UtNGZmMi05MDg2LTM4NDJhYjRkZjMwZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Goldman can regain its swagger,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

INGLEWOOD Calif. – Inglewood Police Chief Mark Fronterotta continues to recover after being hospitalized last month after suffering an “intracranial hemorrhage” around Jan 13.

Inglewood Mayor James T. Butts Jr. continued to provide periodic updates on the chief’s condition noting Fronterotta made it out of the ICU and into a recovery unit around Jan. 24.

What didn’t stop was Fronterotta’s signature appearing on council agenda items dated Jan. 24 and Jan. 31.

On Jan. 24 he signed documents related to a police substation at Hollywood Park and on Jan. 31 he signed three items related to a two-year agreement for department uniforms an invoice for repairs to a SWAT vehicle and an invoice for a tactical robot to enhance “situational awareness” for officers.

While Fronterotta recuperates and ponders whether to return to duties Lt. Cardell Hurt was elevated to Acting Police Chief and has now begun signing staff reports on the department’s behalf.

On the Feb. 7 regular city council meeting the police department will receive nearly $246000 in Tobacco Grant funds that the City draws down on after providing invoices for reimbursable expenditures.

Chief Fronterotta signed the grant Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Jan. 11 the day before he suffered the intracranial hemorrhage. The contact person listed on the taxpayer ID form is Mayor Butts not a member of either the Finance or Police department.

Hurt also executed an agreement to receive Citizen Options for Public Safety (COPS) funds in the amount of $165000. The funds are intended to be kept in an account separate from the General Fund so they are not co-mingled and are intended to be used for front-line law enforcement efforts.

The department is suggesting the funds be spent on office furniture public service announcements computer software/hardware and non-POST/non-reimbursable training.

The staff report also indicates the City will use the funds to pay outstanding invoices totaling $181000; $24000 for shooting accessories $9600 for uniforms and $148000 to Motorola Solutions.",,,,,,,,,

Director Model Portfolios

This article is relevant to financial professionals who are considering offering Model Portfolios to their clients. If you are an individual investor interested in WisdomTree ETF Model Portfolios please inquire with your financial professional. Not all financial professionals have access to these Model Portfolios.

In the 10+ years following the great financial crisis U.S. companies with high growth potential dominated global equity markets.

This was largely due to the prevailing macro environment as steady economic growth muted inflation and ultra-low interest rates facilitated the continued multiple expansion of U.S. stocks.

As a result the more cyclical and value-oriented universe of stocks outside the U.S. lagged. From June 2008 to December 2022 the cumulative underperformance of international versus U.S. equities amounted to more than 200%.

Cumulative Returns in USD (June 2008–December 2022)

Any diversification away from large U.S. growth stocks over this period generally detracted from overall returns. Some U.S. investors have responded by reducing or even eliminating their exposure to international stocks.

At WisdomTree we believe this era of “deworsification” has come to an end. With an evolving macro backdrop and a renewed focus on balance sheet strength margin resilience and the ability to return capital via dividends diversification across both regions and factors may once again prove critical in generating enhanced returns.

This is reflected across our suite of strategic and outcome-oriented Model Portfolios which incorporates globally diversified equity allocations with:

Regional weights roughly aligned with the MSCI All-Country World Index (ACWI)

Strategic tilts toward value quality and dividend factors

Below we outline the logic behind our conviction in global diversification and why valuation-focused investors might find international stocks particularly attractive in today’s market environment.

The Benefits of Global Diversification

First it is important to view the most recent example of U.S. outperformance in a historical context as it only represents one period in what has historically been a cyclical relationship. There are numerous examples of European Japanese and emerging markets having their own “moments in the sun.”

Rolling 2-Year Annualized Relative Returns of U.S. vs. International Equities (1969–2022)

Even after this recent prolonged cycle of U.S. outperformance long-term cumulative dollar returns across global regions do not differ significantly. Put simply we don’t believe global diversification sacrifices long-term return potential.

However imperfect correlations of returns across regions can help protect portfolios on the downside particularly in periods of poor

U.S. equity returns.

Rolling 5-Year Returns U.S. vs. International (1970–2022)

This was the case in 2022 as international equities as measured by the MSCI All-Country World Ex-USA Index were down approximately -16.0% compared to the -18.5% return on the S&P 500 Index. Local returns of international equities were even more resilient with the MSCI EAFE and MSCI Emerging Markets (Local) Indexes down only -7.0% and -15.5% respectively.1

A global approach to equity investing can also help enhance sector diversification.

Even with several large tech-focused U.S. firms now in the Communication Services (Meta Alphabet) and Consumer Discretionary (Tesla Amazon) sectors U.S. equities are still much more concentrated in the Technology sector than international indexes.

Sector Exposures—U.S. and International Equity Indexes

We also believe a regionally diversified equity portfolio is necessary to gain exposure to today’s global economy.

Despite calls for the “end of globalization” U.S. annual imports have only accelerated in recent years2 and U.S. companies in the MSCI USA Index now generate approximately 40% of their revenues from overseas.3

Geographic Revenue Exposure for MSCI Country Indexes

Senior Investment Strategy Advisor to WisdomTree Professor Jeremy Siegel and Global CIO Jeremy Schwartz argue in the latest edition of Stocks for the Long Run that the current definition of a company’s domicile based on the location of its headquarters may become increasingly arbitrary in today’s globally interconnected world.4

Current Valuations Support an Allocation to International Equities

Beyond the strategic arguments for global diversification current valuations of international equities make a compelling opportunistic case for their inclusion in portfolios.

The price premium on U.S. equities based on the estimated price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is now near an all-time high.

Historical Estimated Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratios

The relative valuation discounts on international stocks can also be seen in current dividend yields. As of December 31 2022 the MSCI EAFE and Emerging Markets Indexes offer dividend yields of 3.23% and 3.36% respectively versus the 1.69% dividend yield of the S&P 500 Index.5

Relative Strength of the U.S. Dollar

As most U.S. investors do not hedge foreign currency exposure within international equity allocations another important factor in relative performance versus domestic equities is the strength of the U.S. dollar.

Historically a stronger USD has generally been associated with U.S. equity outperformance while a weaker USD has generally been associated with international stocks outperforming U.S. equities.

Rolling 2-Year Annualized Relative Returns

While the dollar recently took a breather from the relentless strengthening seen throughout 2021–2022 it is still more than one standard deviation above long-term averages.

U.S. Dollar Index

Should this trend of USD weakness continue it may present an additional tailwind for international stocks.

Conclusion

While recent U.S. equity outperformance has led some investors to question the role of international stocks we are strong believers in the potential long-term advantages of global equity investing:

NFLX,Netflix,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJjaGVpZ2h0cy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMi8wNS9uZXRmbGl4LWNhbmNlbGluZy1zaG93cy1jb2x1bW4v0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Weynand: Netflix Has A Content Problem And It's One Of Its Own Doing - The Heights,"Dear Netflix

My message is short and simple. Please stop canceling shows after one season. It’s creating a massive problem for your content and your viewers.

Time and time again I find myself in a tough spot when deciding how to spend my free time as a college student. Between classes clubs intramurals and a social life the chances that I have to watch television are sparing. With the way Netflix carelessly massacres its television catalog I can’t use my TV time the way I want to. I’m coerced to watch the popular offerings rather than the projects that actually peak my interest.

Frankly that’s not the way TV watching should be.

What got me thinking about Netflix’s show renewal habits was the recent cancellation of 1899 after only one season. 1899 seemingly did everything right and the concept had me captivated. The show was a period piece that followed a boat full of immigrants traveling from the United Kingdom to the United States. It was billed as a suspenseful mystery series and coming from the creators of Dark 1899 had every reason to be among my favorite shows.

If only I had the chance to watch it.

1899 lived a little over a month—it premiered on Nov. 17 and was axed on Jan. 2. In that short month(ish) period I was grinding for finals enjoying the holiday season and catching up with my home friends when I went back home for Winter Break. I barely had a moment to myself let alone time to watch TV. In the meantime 1899 received solid reviews from critics and built up a passionate following on social media. Now that it’s been canceled I struggle to find a reason to watch it.

When I have such little time to watch TV why should I waste that time growing attached to characters who won’t be returning for more stories? It doesn’t make sense for me to watch 1899 when the plot will remain unresolved and the character arcs will never be completed. Netflix is discouraging me from watching its own series and it has me convinced.

This isn’t the first time Netflix has done this to me. I have similar grievances with the streaming platform when it comes to shows like Blockbuster and Resident Evil. Both are shows that fell off my radar once they were canceled after their first seasons.

I think Netflix expects me to watch the wildly popular and complex Stranger Things once every few years and be satisfied. On my Top Pick For You Page on Netflix I find shows like The Crown or Cobra Kai. Netflix probably says to itself “he’s got plenty of options with countless seasons to last him for months at a time.” I enjoy the prestige of The Crown and Cobra Kai is a fun show to fall asleep to but I’m trying to diversify the shows I watch. Sometimes I’m looking for hidden gems that don’t get the attention they deserve. The problem is that these hidden gems don’t really exist past a season or two.

From Netflix’s point of view I understand why it would think to cancel smaller shows that don’t initially attract a larger audience. At the end of the day it’s a business and so it makes sense to spend less money where there’s less of an audience. That being said there are breaks in this airtight business model that Netflix has adopted. Netflix charges people based on a general subscription rather than charging customers for each specific show they watch. It makes more sense to diversify Netflix’s catalog to satisfy more innovative content. What’s more Netflix doesn’t account for shows increasing their creative potential—and as a result viewership—throughout multiple seasons.

A great example of a show growing its audience over time is HBO’s Game of Thrones (GoT). The first season’s budget was between $50 to 60 million yet the series only garnered an average of 2.52 million viewers throughout its first season. Compare that with the first season of HBO’s The Sopranos which garnered an average of 3.43 million viewers per episode on a budget of under $30 million. The viewership versus budget alone for the first season of GoT is discouraging at best and by Netflix standards it probably would’ve been canceled.

Everyone knows that the story doesn’t end there for GoT. By its final season GoT averaged nearly 12 million viewers per episode a feat rarely seen by a television series. Netflix isn’t network TV so its viewership data is somewhat of a mystery especially when it comes to shows that it cancels. Regardless of a show’s viewership Netflix isn’t giving these canceled series a chance to become a future GoT or in Netflix terms the next Squid Game.

This show renewal habit discourages creativity in the entertainment industry. Not only are existing stories cut short by cancellations but the shows that do survive offer unoriginal or recycled content. The new hits on Netflix tend to be shows like Wednesday a spinoff of The Addams Family.

Netflix is also known to swoop in and save canceled shows from other networks like Lucifer which originally premiered on FOX. These stories are often fun but creative boundaries aren’t being pushed when the content already has a strong base in pop culture.

In the new streaming world I wonder if original content has a place in television anymore. Although it doesn’t realize it Netflix is slowly changing the way TV operates for the worse. I’m still looking for my hidden gems—the shows that are innovative unique and worthwhile. In the meantime I’ll guess Netflix expects me to anxiously wait another two years for Stranger Things season five. I can’t wait.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vYWJvdXQubmV0ZmxpeC5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9jYXN0LXJldmVhbGVkLWZvci1uZXRmbGl4LWxpbWl0ZWQtc2VyaWVzLWVyaWPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cast Revealed for Netflix Limited Series 'Eric',ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://about.netflix.com/en/news/cast-revealed-for-netflix-limited-series-eric on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiT2h0dHBzOi8vYWJvdXQubmV0ZmxpeC5jb20vZW4vbmV3cy9jYXN0LXJldmVhbGVkLWZvci1uZXRmbGl4LWxpbWl0ZWQtc2VyaWVzLWVyaWPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHA6Ly9oaXN0b3J5bmV3c25ldHdvcmsub3JnL2FydGljbGUvMTg0OTQ50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,"Reflecting on Netflix's ""Women at War""","ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiLGh0dHA6Ly9oaXN0b3J5bmV3c25ldHdvcmsub3JnL2FydGljbGUvMTg0OTQ50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002562564EEF0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

It’s also in at least one important way the most interesting. Along with Anderson’s memoir Love Pamela also out in February the new documentary is what we get in Anderson’s voice.

Wronged-woman revisitations have been fashionable for a few years now. After simmering under the radar with the success of the popular podcast You’re Wrong About since 2018 it came to a rolling boil in 2021 with Hulu and the New York Times’s documentary Framing Britney Spears. Pop culture populated itself with stories of the women we loved and despised and raked over the coals and with eloquent mea culpas on their behalf.

The great achievement of Pamela a Love Story is that unlike its predecessor Pam and Tommy it manages to advance the analysis that all those wronged-woman revisitations are theoretically doing in the first place. It makes a convincing case that Pam and Tommy exists within the same genre of callous exploitation as all those Jay Leno jokes about the couple’s sex tape did in 1996.

About that sex tape: the tape Anderson made with then-husband Tommy Lee was meant to be private. In 1995 Rand Gauthier a construction worker who said Lee stiffed him on the bill for house renovation stole the tape from their home and shortly began to sell access to it over the internet. Anderson and Lee sued Gauthier and everyone else who seemed to be involved in its distribution.

The couple eventually dropped the suit apparently exhausted by the legal wrangling. Pamela a Love Story shines a light on the legal argument that exhausted them so. In court Gauthier’s lawyers argued that Anderson had no right to privacy because she was a Playboy star; she had exposed her naked body to the world before of her own free will and so she should have no problem with it being exposed now against her will.

“It made me feel like I was such a horrible woman” Anderson recalls in Pamela. “I’m just a piece of meat. That this should mean nothing to me because I’m such a whore basically.”

The legal argument here was that by having ever been naked in public on her own terms Anderson had revoked her right to consent. She had become that kind of woman: the kind of woman who did not deserve privacy.

Anderson says in Pamela that she felt the same way when she found out that Hulu was going to make a TV show about the events. “They should have had to have my permission” she says.

Last February Hulu released Pam and Tommy which aimed to do for Anderson what American Crime Story: Impeachment did for Monica Lewinsky. It was supposed to reveal the extent to which Anderson had been mistreated after her sex tape became public against her will and late-night hosts everywhere found themselves with a new opportunity to mock Anderson as an infamous “dumb blonde.” That Anderson loudly disavowed the show and said that it was made without her consent — unlike Lewinsky who was a producer on Impeachment — didn’t seem to matter. Shouldn’t Anderson get a mea culpa now regardless of whether she wanted one or not?

Pam and Tommy premiered a year after Framing Britney Spears to mild interest but also to what appeared to be a bit of revisitation fatigue. At this point the story of another blonde sex symbol who turned out to have been mistreated seemed to feel like an old old story and the show didn’t add anything particularly new to what was by now becoming a formula. Reviews were anemic and while it was nominated for multiple Emmys it only won one for makeup.

In Pamela a Love Story Pamela’s son tells her he watched the first three episodes. In response we see her anxiously munching on a vegan croissant quipping for the cameras about emotional eating. “I blocked that out of my life” she says. “I had to in order to survive really. It was a survival mechanism. And now that it’s all coming up again I feel sick in my whole stomach from the middle of my chest all the way down just my stomach feels like it’s been punched. I don’t feel good right now.”

In an interview with EW in 2022 Pam and Tommy director Craig Gillespie says the members of the creative team “absolutely respect the privacy” of Anderson despite making the show without her blessing. He went on “I felt for us what we’re trying to do is really change the narrative and your perspective of what happened. And this felt like such an opportunity to do that and to be able to look at the story through today’s lens and the outrageousness and just the atrocities that happened. I felt that hopefully it would change people’s point of view on that.”

The argument here is that Anderson was a wronged woman of the type that was currently fashionable. If she did not agree to her story being retold it didn’t matter. It’s the same logic that animated the release of the sex tape in the ’90s the dehumanization at its core disguised with a faux-progressive veneer. The story could go on without her because she had made herself that kind of woman.

There are always problems with a documentary made through close cooperation with its subject. Pamela a Love Story is designed to be as sympathetic as possible to Anderson. To that end it glosses lightly over her alliances with figures like Vladimir Putin (for anti-fur campaign purposes she says here) and Julian Assange (in this doc she says simply that she’s very pro-transparency but in the past she’s said he’s been falsely accused because of “the Clinton monopoly on the media”). Her skeptical comments about the Me Too movement (Weinstein’s victims “should have known what they were getting into” she said in 2017) go undiscussed entirely.

Still Pamela a Love Story is a massive improvement on its predecessor. Pam and Tommy contributed little if anything to the public conversation that was not already there. It never quite justified its own existence.

Pamela a Love Story does move the conversation forward. It suggests brutally that shows like Pam and Tommy exist more to let us indulge our titillated fascination with old scandals than to make any kind of principled stand against misogyny."

Modeled after a Canadian program Welcome Corps is the U.S. Department of State’s new private sponsorship program for American citizens to assist refugees. In the program’s first phase sponsors will be matched with refugees who have already been approved to enter the country.

To qualify sponsors must join a group of five or more private sponsors to commit together. Applicants also must independently raise $2275 per refugee complete a background check attend training sessions and sign a commitment form as well as submit a welcome plan documenting how they will support the refugees in their resettlement. If accepted sponsors will be required to complete reports and surveys over the course of one year.

Cecilia Muñoz co-chair of Welcome.US said the program is designed to distribute the work of resettling refugees to everyday citizens who want to help and the program’s private funding model effectively means there is no cap on the work it can do.

“There are nine organizations that for decades have been resettling refugees in the United States and they are heroic” said Muñoz. “They do amazing work but their capacity is limited. So the idea is to honor the great work that they do in resettling refugees but expand the opportunity to help people as they start their new lives in the U.S. to anybody in the country. In addition to what the resettlement agencies do so any group of five people that is willing to take the plunge can go through the training can raise the resources and can participate in the amazing work of helping someone start a new life in this country.”

Alianza Americas and the Chicago Refugee Coalition signed on to support the Welcome Corps’ mission. Alianza Americas director of programs Helena Olea said she thinks naturalized citizens of Latin American origin will want to be part of the effort.

“I think it's an opportunity to learn more about living in the United States from other persons” Olea said. “It will be a great opportunity also for immigrants to be part of the effort to welcome recently arrived refugees. So I think that is what this opportunity means for many Latin American immigrants who could be part of this project.”

Chicago Refugee Coalition executive director Alisa Roadcup said she doesn’t really see any downside to the program.

“At the end of the day both people benefit so deeply and so richly and immensely from the opportunity to give and to learn and to receive” Roadcup said. “Once the first 90 days of supports come to a close for refugees then there's this tremendous gap in how refugees are going to successfully integrate long-term. The humanity of who these people are and we know them because we've sponsored them and we've brought them here and they have meaning and humanity to us. The benefit of this program from that perspective I think is extraordinarily powerful and really exciting.”

Welcome Corps has set a goal to recruit 10000 Americans to help resettle 5000 refugees and Muñoz said her organization has already received quite a bit of interest.

“We’ve already had 22000 inquiries since the announcement” Muñoz said. “And we know because there is a similar program through which regular Americans can help sponsor people from Ukraine during this war that 200000 Americans have stepped up to help sponsor Ukrainian families in this moment of need. So the great thing here is that the American people are willing to become welcomers. And that says a lot of good things about us.”

One of New Farm’s original homes Doralma has stood at the corner of Oxlade Drive and Hazelwood St since it was built in 1910 for William Stanley and his wife Rosa Oxlade after whose family the prestigious Oxlade Drive was named.

The three-bedroom house on its 860sq m block at 123 Oxlade Drive New Farm has been in the same family ever since and great-great-grandchildren were in the crowd of 80 to see the home of their descendants go to auction.

“It’s a very special occasion” Rosa Oxlade’s granddaughter Libby Black said while nursing her own granddaughter Bronte Black.

“There’s about 13 of us who have come today.”

Oxlade Drive is real estate gold in inner-city New Farm with three of the suburb’s top six sales coming from this riverside address ranging from $8m to $10.2m. The suburb is also one of only two in Brisbane where the median house price has topped $3m joining neighbouring Teneriffe.

Ray White auctioneer Haesley Cush welcomed the crowd and began introducing the property at the same time as a late bidder filled out his registration form using a telegraph pole outside the property to support the paper as he wrote.

In the front garden respected Gold Coast agent and principal of Lacey West Tony West waited for Mr Cush to finish talking about Brisbane’s golden decade before placing an opening bid of $3m.

Despite five registered bidders in the crowd only the late registration – a local identity looking to land bank the property – engaged with him above this level offering $3.1m for the home.

Mr West returned fire with an offer of $3.2m and then increases shortened with bids of $3.25m and $3.3m.

“Nick my instructions please” Mr Cush asked of Ray White Clayfield Principal Nicholas Given.

The auction paused as Mr Given and Ray White New Farm principal Matt Lancashire consulted with bidders and Rosa Oxlade’s granddaughter accomplished author and estate executor Judy Magub who was inside the home.

An increased offer of $3.425m was given by Tony West and the property sold under the hammer but not to Mr West.

“Tony has been a family friend for many years” said Sally Yeates of Indooroopilly who had been standing beside Mr West with her husband Darren and emerged as the actual buyer of the property.

“Darren’s parents and (Mr West’s) parents lived at Boonah and were best mates growing up.

“We are going to definitely keep the house. We don’t intend to develop it or split the block we have no intention of selling anything off. We will do it up and live here.”

The couple has already engaged local architect Nicole Weston – who worked with them on their current house in Indooroopilly – to help with designs for the historic home."

The sites include Cavendish Solar Energy Center in Okeechobee County and two in St. Lucie County: Pink Trail Solar Energy Center

and Bluefield Preserve Solar Energy Center in St. Lucie County. The site in Okeechobee will provide power to the FPL Cavendish NextGen Hydrogen Hub which is expected to be completed at the end of this year FPL says and will be state's first-of-its-kind ""‘green hydrogen"" facility.

The other new sites are two in Calhoun County one in Clay County one in Escambia County one in Jackson County one in Miami-Dade County and one in Santa Roe County.

The 10 new centers are capable of generating 745 megawatts of quiet emissions-free energy which represents taking 140000 gasoline-dependent cars off the road each year according to FPL.

The electric company also expects six more solar energy centers to come online later this year.

In all FPL has 60 solar energy centers installed statewide to power electricity for 900000 homes. FPL has approximately 5.8 million accounts or more than 12 million people.

FPL’s solar power plant fleet is the largest in America and has saved customers about $375 million in fuel costs in 2022.

FPL says it hopes to eliminate carbon emissions from its power plant fleet by no later than 2045.

""This important milestone for FPL is the latest example of our unwavering commitment to America’s largest solar buildout on behalf of our customers and the Sunshine State” Tim Oliver vice president of FPL Development said in a news release. “We remain committed to making sustained long-term investments in solar energy – which uses no fuel to produce energy – to build a more resilient and more sustainable energy future our children and grandchildren can depend on.”

FPL is a subsidiary of Juno Beach-based NextEra Energy Inc.

Late last month FPL proposed another rate increase to offset the costs of two hurricanes last year. The proposal which was filed with Florida Public Service seeks to balance unrecovered fuel and storm costs from 2022 as well as a recent decline in projected fuel costs in 2023.

The cost recovery for Hurricane Ian and Hurricane Nicole would be spread over a 12-month period according to FPL.

The Juno Beach-based utility company earlier received approval for a rate hike in 2023.

Under FPL's proposal a typical 1000-kWh residential bill for customers in Florida's peninsula would increase by about 10%.

Even with the proposed increase its rates remain ""well below the national average and remain the lowest among Florida's investor-owned utilities.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oZXJhbGR0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbHVtbnMvbW9yZS12b2ljZXMvMjAyMy8wMi8wNS9mbG9yaWRpYW5zLXNob3VsZC1hcHBsYXVkLXNpbGFneXMtZXhpdC1mcm9tLWZsb3JpZGEtcG93ZXItbGlnaHQvNjk4NjM5OTkwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Floridians should applaud Silagy's exit from Florida Power & Light,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMilwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5oZXJhbGR0cmlidW5lLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9vcGluaW9uL2NvbHVtbnMvbW9yZS12b2ljZXMvMjAyMy8wMi8wNS9mbG9yaWRpYW5zLXNob3VsZC1hcHBsYXVkLXNpbGFneXMtZXhpdC1mcm9tLWZsb3JpZGEtcG93ZXItbGlnaHQvNjk4NjM5OTkwMDcv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000256279DD780>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

However the Beaverton brand is forging ahead with the model nonetheless unveiling its third limited edition iteration now in the past week.

The AM1 G “Periwinkle” is the latest of that trio arriving as the celebratory shoe for the springtime PGA Championship at Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester New York. Paying homage to the perennial flower known for its prominence in western New York this rendition has a purple budding flower placed on the tongues as well as the insoles while further purple accents are found on the eyelets and camo patterned outsole. A bright pink is also used for midsole contrast stitching on the Swoosh and Nike Air Max logos. Neutrals dominate the upper for a nice interplay between beige and white allowing the bright flowery tones to the come to the forefront.

When it comes to holidays The Swoosh can’t help but contain its excitement with each honorary effort from the Beaverton brand being teased well before the actual day of celebration. Alongside love filling the air around us and under our feet this Valentine’s Day the Nike Air Max 90 Terrascape is coordinating a vibrant “Mardi Gras” ensemble.

While devoid of any specific imagery denoting the colorful occasion set to take place in a few weeks the recycled pair’s vibrant color blocking is reminiscent of the New Orleans festivities all the same. Employing the silhouette’s typically diverse tooling a cream-treated twill fabric rounds the full-length overlay while its presiding color-matched base layer indulges in a burlap textile. Elsewhere crisp white laces illuminate the upper in tandem with its semi-translucent lime-colored quarter overlays and vibrant violet Swoosh. Infusing a touch of yellow at opposite ends of the vamp and heel counter two different shades of mint coat the suede and rubberized mid-foot panels while a sample of lavender outfits the recycled sole unit underfoot.

Evacuation and shelter-in-place orders remain in effect in a northeastern Ohio town after a train derailment sparked a massive fire and concerns about air quality.

A Norfolk Southern train with more than 100 cars derailed in East Palestine about 15 miles south of Youngstown according to the National Transportation Safety Board.

There were 20 cars with hazardous material in the train – 10 of which derailed. Of those 10 five were carrying vinyl chloride the NTSB said Saturday night.

“We have not confirmed vinyl chloride has been released other than from the pressure release devices” the agency added.

NTSB board member Michael Graham said in a news conference earlier Saturday there was still an “active fire scene” and could not estimate when the flames would be put out.

The cause of the derailment was not known Saturday.

Investigators say the train had image and data recorders onboard. It will take four to six weeks for the NTSB to have a preliminary report on the accident Graham said.

No injuries were reported.

EPA: No harmful levels of compounds in air

One car released some of the vinyl chloride through a safety release valve Graham said. State environmental officials say they have not detected any harmful levels of the chemical in the community.

Exposure with vinyl chloride a colorless gas is associated with a higher risk of certain forms of cancer according to the federal government’s National Cancer Institute.

No harmful levels of compounds had been detected in the air as of Saturday evening a spokesperson with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency told CNN in an email.

“Ohio EPA will remain on site and air monitors will remain in place as long as necessary” Ohio EPA spokesperson James Lee said in a statement. “Ohio EPA has established containment to help limit any damage to local streams and rivers from water runoff from the firefighting.”

The agency will work with local officials and the railroad company to “identify the nature and extent” of any possible contamination and will work to ensure cleanup efforts to protect human health and the environment Lee said.

Evacuation order remains in effect

Officials issued a shelter-in-place order for the entire town of roughly 5000 people while an evacuation order was in effect within a mile of the train crossing at James Street as of early Saturday. Conaway said he did not know when those orders would be lifted.

Two evacuation stations have opened to provide shelter to residents and the Red Cross has been notified Trent Conaway the mayor of East Palestine said.

Conaway on Saturday called for the “exercise of all necessary emergency authority for protection of lives and the property of the residents of the Village of East Palestine Ohio.”

The proclamation also called on citizens to comply with the emergency measures.

Traci Spratt the interim manager of the village of East Palestine said late Saturday the one-mile radius evacuation order from the incident remained in place “until further notice” and stressed “We need everyone to stay away from the scene.”

Spratt also said officials were conducting “continuous air monitoring and have found zero health risks.”

“The village’s drinking water is safe to drink and is being continually monitored” Spratt added.

Photos from the scene showed a large dense cloud of smoke engulfing flames atop the train. Firefighters from three states Pennsylvania Ohio and West Virginia responded according to Conaway.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Saturday he was briefed on the derailment and state authorities were “prepared to help our neighbors.”

The Norfolk Southern train departed from Madison Illinois and was bound for Conway Pennsylvania when it derailed according to the NTSB.

Norfolk Southern Railway said in a statement its team members were at the scene and added it was “coordinating with federal state and local agencies.”

The company said it set up a family assistance center “to address the needs of the community and support those directly impacted.”

“Additionally we are supporting the efforts of the American Red Cross and their temporary community shelters through a $25000 donation” the company said.

Though the company’s 150-car train in Ohio reportedly burst into 100-foot flames upon derailing — and was transporting materials that triggered a fireball when they were released and incinerated — it was not being regulated as a “high-hazard flammable train” federal officials told the Lever. Documents show that when current transportation safety rules were first created a federal agency sided with industry lobbyists and limited regulations governing the transport of hazardous compounds. The decision effectively exempted many trains hauling dangerous materials — including the one in Ohio — from the “high-hazard” classification and its more stringent safety requirements. Amid the lobbying blitz against stronger transportation safety regulations Norfolk Southern paid executives millions and spent billions on stock buybacks — all while the company shed thousands of employees despite warnings that understaffing is intensifying safety risks. Norfolk Southern officials also fought off a shareholder initiative that could have required company executives to “assess review and mitigate risks of hazardous material transportation.” The sequence of events began a decade ago in the wake of a major uptick in derailments of trains carrying crude oil and hazardous chemicals including a New Jersey train crash that leaked the same toxic chemical as in Ohio. In response the Obama administration in 2014 proposed improving safety regulations for trains carrying petroleum and other hazardous materials. However after industry pressure the final measure ended up narrowly focused on the transport of crude oil and exempting trains carrying many other combustible materials including the chemical involved in this weekend’s disaster. Then came 2017: after rail industry donors delivered more than $6 million to GOP campaigns the Trump administration — backed by rail lobbyists and Senate Republicans — rescinded part of that rule aimed at making better braking systems widespread on the nation’s rails. Specifically regulators killed provisions requiring rail cars carrying hazardous flammable materials to be equipped with electronic braking systems to stop trains more quickly than conventional air brakes. Norfolk Southern had previously touted the new technology — known as electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brakes — for its “potential to reduce train stopping distances by as much as 60 percent over conventional air brake systems.” But the company’s lobby group nonetheless pressed for the rule’s repeal telling regulators that it would “impose tremendous costs without providing offsetting safety benefits.” That argument won out with Trump officials — and the Biden administration has not moved to reinstate the brake rule or expand the kinds of trains subjected to tougher safety regulations. When current transportation safety rules were first created a federal agency sided with industry lobbyists and limited regulations governing the transport of hazardous compounds. “Would ECP brakes have reduced the severity of this accident? Yes” Steven Ditmeyer a former senior official at the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) told the Lever. “The railroads will test new features. But once they are told they have to do it . . . they don’t want to spend the money.” Norfolk Southern did not answer questions about its efforts to weaken safety mandates. The company also did not answer questions about what kind of braking system was operating on the train that derailed in Ohio. The company referred the Lever to the National Transportation Safety Board the federal agency that is investigating the accident and that had originally called for more expansive rules governing the transport of hazardous materials. A spokesperson for one advocacy group pressing for tougher safety regulations said the Ohio disaster is the latest consequence of the rail industry’s cost cutting profit-at-all-cost business model. “Prior to the stock buyback era railroads agreed that ECP brakes were a good thing” said Ron Kaminkow a longtime railroad worker and organizer with Railroad Workers United. “The railroads hadn’t yet come to the realization that they could do whatever they wanted. ECP brakes were on the drawing board then off.”

“Fast as the Speed of Light” The vast majority of the nation’s trains continue to rely on a braking system first developed in 1868. Trains equipped with these traditional air brakes make emergency stops more slowly and with higher rates of damage than trains equipped with ECP brakes according to both safety advocates and the Federal Railroad Administration. While air brakes stop train cars individually as air pressure moves sequentially from one car to the next ECP brakes operate using an electronic signal and can stop an entire train much faster. As one railroad industry insider told the Washington Post anonymously in 2016: “Trains are like giant Slinkies. When you have that back of the train running into the front of the train they can actually push cars out cause a derailment and cause a hell of a mess.” ECP braking the analyst said takes “the energy out of the train quicker so when a train does derail there is less energy that has to be absorbed by crushing tank cars.” Beginning in the 2000s federal rail regulators pushed the rail industry to upgrade to electronic brakes that would lead to shorter stop times. After a 2006 technical report commissioned by the FRA concluded that ECP “could significantly enhance rail safety and efficiency” the agency took the position of promoting widespread adoption of the technology. The railroads including Norfolk Southern were initially outspoken advocates of the new equipment. Electronic brakes were so safe the companies argued that regulators could exempt upgraded trains from other safety mandates saving time and money on frequent stops for safety inspections. During a 2007 hearing before the Federal Railroad Administration Donald Usak manager of engineering for Norfolk Southern’s fleet testified to the “big advantage for emergency braking” offered by the new systems. “We all know the saying ‘as fast as the speed of light’” Usak said. “So does electricity travel at the speed of light. Signals from the engineer are at the rear of the train instantly. Signals initiated at any one of the vehicles in the train are throughout that train instantly.” Later that year when reporting its quarterly earnings Norfolk Southern bragged to investors that it had “made railroad history” by equipping one of its trains exclusively with the new ECP technology and announced plans to add the safety feature to thirty more of its trains in the coming months. But the industry abruptly changed its tune once regulators moved in 2014 to make the upgrades mandatory. That year — after a series of high-profile rail accidents — the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration proposed a regulation requiring train cars carrying hazardous materials to be retrofitted with safety features including ECP brakes over a period of nearly a decade. The proposed regulation also imposed speed limits on trains carrying hazardous materials and required volatility tests for the substances being transported. The railroad oil and chemical industries came out in full force against the regulation arguing the new requirements would be disruptive and costly. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) — a lobbying group to which Norfolk Southern has long been a dues-paying member — in particular fought the ECP braking standards. “AAR strongly opposes any requirement to use ECP brakes” the association said in one of multiple comment letters on the rule. “ECP brakes would be extremely costly without providing an offsetting benefit . . . [the Federal Railroad Administration] assumed that business benefits would more than compensate for the costs of ECP brakes but [the] industry to this day has not identified business benefits that would justify transitioning to ECP brakes.” Norfolk Southern also reported lobbying against “requiring ECP brakes” during the rule-making process. In a 2015 legislative testimony Norfolk Southern’s vice president Rudy Husband told Pennsylvania lawmakers that while the company planned to comply with the new rule the “rail industry has serious concerns about the ECP brake requirements and the potential adverse impacts on the fluidity of the national freight rail network.”

A Hazard by Any Other Name Alongside their campaign to kill the brake rule industry lobbyists pushed to limit the types of chemical compounds that would be covered by new regulations including the brake rule. They proposed limiting the definition of “high-hazard flammable trains” or HHFT mostly to cover oil trains — but not trains carrying the industrial chemical on the Norfolk Southern train that necessitated evacuations in Ohio. “It would be inappropriate to include those other flammable liquids in the rule without assessing how and in what quantities they are shipped and what risks are associated with their transportation” wrote the American Chemistry Council which lobbies for chemical companies in its letter asking regulators to limit the rule. By contrast the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) the federal agency tasked with investigating transportation accidents argued for a broader definition of “high-hazard flammable trains.” The agency pointed out that the industry’s own classifications of which hazardous materials should trigger more stringent safety precautions were broader than those in the proposed rule. Citing an AAR memo on the topic the NTSB wrote that “the railroad industry recognizes that additional safety precautions including speed restrictions are needed for key trains that transport any hazardous materials.” The NTSB explicitly called for the rules to cover Class 2 flammable gases — a category that includes vinyl chloride the chemical that was transported by the Ohio train that derailed. Regulators also noted that “comments from the concerned public local government tribal communities towns and cities voiced concern” that the industry’s proposed definitions of “high-hazard flammable trains” were too narrow — and some commenters “even suggested that a train consisting of one or more tank cars carrying crude oil or any other hazardous material should be classified as an HHFT.” One mayor of a rail-trafficked Chicago suburb told regulators: “We support comments seeking to insure that all tank cars used in the transport of Class 2 flammable hazmat not only those in HHFTs will be covered by the agencies’ new rules.”

“The Costs of the ECP Rule Substantially Outweigh Its Benefits” In 2015 the Obama administration issued the new transportation rule which was far less stringent and wide-ranging than safety advocates had demanded. The final regulation’s definition of “high-hazard flammable trains” was not expanded as the NTSB requested and the regulations applied only to trains with more than twenty of cars in a single block carrying hazardous materials or thirty-five located throughout the train. However the rule did require ECP braking for the subset of rail cars that would still be classified as “high-hazard flammable trains” — an important step in pushing the rail industry to expand its use of the braking technology. Though the rule was limited in scope industry groups nonetheless lambasted the ECP braking requirements. “I have a hard time believing the determination to impose ECP brakes is anything but a rash rush to judgment” the president of the AAR said about the new rule. Obama-era regulators disagreed. “The mission of the FRA is safety and not focusing on what is convenient or inexpensive or provides the most cost savings for the rail industry” said Sarah Feinberg the FRA administrator at the time about the new rule. “When I focus on safety I land on ECP. It’s a very black-and-white issue for me.” Soon after the rule’s enactment the railroad industry took the matter to Congress and found allies in Senate Republicans after an election cycle that saw rail industry donors dump $6 million into GOP campaign coffers. Sen. John Thune (R-SD) — the Senate’s third largest recipient of rail industry campaign cash — pushed to repeal the electronic braking rule outright before settling for a measure requiring additional research and a new cost-benefit analysis of the technology. Under former president Donald Trump the braking upgrades quickly became another casualty of his administration’s slash-and-burn approach to regulatory policy. While the Obama administration had estimated that the rule could save more than $1 billion by averting accidents the Trump administration rolled out new figures that cut the estimated benefits by a third. While the Obama administration had estimated that the rule could save more than $1 billion by averting accidents the Trump administration rolled out new figures that cut the estimated benefits by a third. The AAR lobbying group concurred that “the costs of the ECP rule substantially outweigh its benefits” and claimed the mandate would cost them about $3 billion — or roughly two weeks of their operating revenue in a typical year. The FRA estimated the brake requirement would cost about half a billion. Trump’s Transportation Department ultimately rescinded the brake rule in late 2017. Thune praised the decision in a statement arguing that “sound science and careful study” had won the day. But a 2018 investigation from the Associated Press revealed that the Trump Transportation Department had flubbed its calculations. By excluding the most common type of train derailments the government’s analysis omitted at least $117 million in estimated future damages when it revised the rule’s potential benefits to justify its repeal. The agency acknowledged the error and issued a technical correction to its analysis but said that the expense was still too great to reinstate the ECP brake rule.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9lYXN0LXBhbGVzdGluZS10cmFpbi1kZXJhaWxtZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,East Palestine Ohio Train Derailment - Youngstown,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wkbn.com/news/local-news/east-palestine-train-derailment/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrYm4uY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwtbmV3cy9lYXN0LXBhbGVzdGluZS10cmFpbi1kZXJhaWxtZW50L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

Going into Tuesday’s State of the Union address President Joe Biden sees a nation with its future aglow.

Republicans take a far bleaker view – that the country is beset by crushing debt and that Biden is largely responsible for inflation. And the GOP now holds a House majority intent on blocking the president.

The harder reality is that the United States is on a tight rope trying to balance efforts to reduce inflation with the need to stay upright and avoid falling into a recession. That’s with the seemingly inherent contradiction of a soaring job market and the unemployment rate at a near 54-year low.

Based on past speeches Biden believes the policies adopted under his watch can fill the US with new factories and protect against climate change. Roads bridges sewer systems ports and internet service would be improved. The middle class would be more financially secure. So would America’s place in the global economy’s hierarchy.

On Friday the president said the proof was in the January employment report. It showed 517000 jobs were added as the unemployment rate fell to 3.4% making it “crystal clear” that his “chorus of critics” were wrong.

“Here’s where we stand: The strongest job growth in history” Biden said. “Put simply I would argue the Biden economic plan is working.”

Republicans are pushing back. They blamed Biden’s trillion-dollar plus spending for high inflation and surging gas and food prices. GOP lawmakers want to repeal his tax increases and additional money for the IRS. They oppose his forgiveness of student debt and blame him for the migrants seeking to enter the country at the US-Mexico border.

Neither side captures the fullness of the actual state of the economy.

One group of experts can read the data and claim a recession is on the horizon. A different group can focus on a separate set of figures and see reason to rejoice. It’s a disorienting moment.

Biden can celebrate the low jobless rate even as Republicans bemoan inflation that is still running dangerously hot.

“It’s the best of times and the worst of times for the US economy to borrow a phrase” said Mark Zandi chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “The economy is full of contradictions as it struggles to get beyond the massive global shocks of the pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.”

Zandi said he expects the US economy will “skirt” a recession this year though many economists believe a downturn will come.

Gus Faucher PNC Financial Services’ chief economist pegs the odds of a recession this year at 60%. But he said any downturn would be “mild” because “worker shortages will limit layoffs consumer balance sheets are in great shape the banking system is solid.”

Most people in the US assume the nation is already in a recession even if they personally feel fine.

Only 24% of adults call the national economy good and 76% say conditions are poor according to a poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. At the same time 57% say their personal financial situation is good. That’s unchanged since December but it has eroded slightly since earlier last year when 62% felt positively about their finances.

The key force shaping the economy right now is the Federal Reserve which has the mission of keeping prices stable and inflation at around 2%. Consumer prices jumped 6.5% last year.

To bring down inflation the Fed has tried to slow down hiring and growth by raising its benchmark interest rate over the past year. When Biden delivered the State of the Union Address in 2022 the Fed’s benchmark rate was effectively near-zero. It’s now over 4.5% the fastest increase in four decades and Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the rate will likely go higher.

“Without price stability the economy does not work for anyone” Powell told reporters after the Fed board’s most recent meeting.

The Fed rate increases mark a major reversal in how the economy operates.

Ever since the 2008 financial crisis the US central bank had held its benchmark rate near historic lows to bring back growth. That made it easier for tech start-ups because cheap money meant investors expected them to focus on growth instead of profits. Consumers got use to historically cheap rates for mortgages and auto loans.

The past year’s rate jumps produced a sudden whiplash. The stock market fell. Prominent tech companies such as Google and Microsoft recently announced layoffs. Even as computer chip companies began building new plants and crediting Biden’s policies the world economy swung from a dearth of semiconductors to a glut. Mortgage rates initially doubled to over 7% before falling back a bit to 6% last week. The big increase meant monthly payments became unaffordable for would-be homebuyers forcing many to stay in rentals.

Glenn Kelman CEO of the real estate brokerage Redfin said the housing market is stronger than many people expected. But the years of low rates worsened generational inequality. Baby boomers became wealthy as their homes increased in value but then rates jumped at the time when more millennials wanted to buy and they found themselves priced out.

“A generation ago boomers owned 21% of US wealth” Kelman said. “For millennials that number is 7%. They’re still on the outside looking in.”

Carl Tannenbaum chief economist for Northern Trust said he is surprised that the rate increases have hit housing but not employment. Traditional models assumed that efforts to lower inflation would automatically include job losses. But when he talks to companies most are reluctant to fire their workers because businesses had trouble finding skilled employees during the pandemic.

“Because the supply of labor has been so starved for the past two years firms are holding on to who they have” Tannenbaum said. “The prevailing wisdom is if we have a recession it’s going to be shallow. Firms are going to want to be ready to go.”

As much as Biden says his mission is about giving Americans a sense of confidence his challenge might rest with an economy in which few things are certain.

When the pandemic hit in 2020 the government aid was so overwhelming that a financial market crash turned into a rally. Biden tried to assure the country in 2021 that rising prices were a temporary inconvenience only to find that inflation defined how many perceived his first two years as president. The expectation was that interest rate increases would ultimately lead to layoffs and higher unemployment but hiring stayed robust in a sign that the economy is unmoored from traditional expectations.

If Biden faces a challenge on the economy it might just be that no one really knows what could happen next.

“We’re in an environment where there is a lot of uncertainty” said Gregory Daco chief economist at EY-Parthenon. “The conflicting signals we keep getting on the economy make it very hard to get an accurate pulse.”

But following surprise inspections and concerns about the quality of care the CQC downgraded the Trust's rating.

Particular areas of concern were the trust's mental health care - which was described as creating ""unmitigated risks"" and the maternity care which did not ""consistently provide one-to-one care"" for patients in labour.

In June the CQC performed unannounced inspections of the services provided by the trust following concerns about the quality of services.

When CQC inspectors deemed that the Trust did not ""address embed and sustain"" improvements to care the Trust's rating was downgraded.

The Trust is now legally required to improve a range of areas both trust wide and in departments in their hospitals.

The South Tyneside and Sunderland NHS Trust is responsible for:

Durham Diagnostic and Treatment Centre

Intermediate Care Assessment and Rehabilitation (Houghton Primary Care Centre)

Palmer Community Hospital

South Tyneside District Hospital

St Benedict’s Hospice Sunderland Eye Infirmary

Sunderland Royal Hospital

In its report the CQC wrote: ""We identified concerns in relation to patient safety during the inspection of the trust’s core service and we shared these concerns with the trust’s senior leadership team.

""The trust provided details of the immediate action taken to address these concerns. During our inspection of the trust’s leadership and governance we carried out a second inspection of the trust’s core services to check whether the trust had addressed sustained and embedded the improvements required.

""Our return visit found that the trust had not made significant improvement in some of the areas of concern identified in our June inspection which resulted in continued breaches of several regulations. We identified further breaches of regulation during our review of the trust’s well-led.""

Sarah Dronsfield deputy director of operations for the CQC in the North added: ""During this visit we found the trust had made some improvements but had not addressed all of the areas of concern which resulted in continued breaches of several regulations. We also identified further breaches of regulation during our review of how well-led the trust is.

""The leadership team have taken our concerns seriously and has shared their improvement plan with us and has provided regular updates on their progress. We will continue to monitor the trust to ensure it’s putting the improvements that are needed in place and will return to check on progress.""

Still there were a number of positives to come out of the report including a strong set of senior leaders who ""had the necessary knowledge skills and abilities to effectively lead the trust"" and a body of staff who were ""committed to continually learning and improving services.""

Chief executive Ken Bremner said: ""There is no doubt that the past two years has been incredibly tough but there can be no excuses. Our vision is for ‘excellence in all that we do’ and this shows we still have work to do. The CQC has shone a very welcome and helpful light on areas where we need to improve and this has come at an apt time as we look forward to the future.

""Despite all the challenges we face people will always be treated with empathy and the utmost care and kindness here at [South Tyneside and Sunderland]. I want to thank our amazing staff for that. Given the pressure they continue to work under it is a testament to them that this care and compassion still shines through every day.""

Allison Thompson who has chaired the trust board since April last year said that the trust would ""absolutely learn the lessons"" from the report and that it was ""more determined than ever to make progress"".",,,

Lauria tells us that there are three types of hackers: script kitties nation-state hackers and cybercriminals. It’s the middle-of-the-road cybercriminals that are the main threat to us when traveling. They stay around long enough in hotel lobbies or restaurants to listen for all the Mac addresses and capture all of the traffic. Meanwhile you never know that your personal information is being compromised. Sometimes just as when your credit card information has been stolen by an employee from using your card at a restaurant or store it can be an inside job by one or two threat actors working on a ship. It’s not likely but it can happen.

According to a June 27 2022 article in an online publication Cybersecurity Dive Carnival Corporation was the target of a series of cybersecurity incidents between 2019 and 2021 including two ransomware attacks.

The line was the victim of phishing and brute force attacks in May 2019 when threat actors accessed the email accounts of 124 employees and sent phishing emails out to other employees.

There were two ransomware attacks in August 2020 and January 2021. A malware attack discovered on Christmas Day in 2020 resulted in the encryption of Costa Cruises’ computer systems. The final incident occurred in March 2021 when a phishing attack impacted Carnival Princess Cruises and Holland America Line.

The attacks exposed the personal data of the victims including passport numbers and in some cases social security and credit card numbers.

The article states that The New York State Department of Financial Services imposed a $5 million penalty on Carnival Corp. citing the lack of multifactor authentication and lack of proper cybersecurity training for its employees. Carnival also had a $1.25 million settlement in 45 states and one in Washington D.C. citing the failure to protect the information of 180000 customers and employees.

As part of the settlement with the state’s Attorney Generals the piece says that ""Carnival agreed to several provisions including implementation of a breach response and notification plan implement email security training multifactor authentication for remote email access and is undergoing an independent information security assessment.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Hunter Lawrence Wins Opening Round of Eastern Regional 250SX Class Racing

Houston Texas (February 5 2023) Monster Energy Yamaha Star Racing’s Eli Tomac returned to his winning ways holding firm through a dramatic Round 5 of the 2023 Monster Energy AMA Supercross. Team Honda HRC’s Chase Sexton had the lead in his sights but had to settle for second inside NRG Stadium in Houston Texas.

Monster Energy Kawasaki’s Jason Anderson took the final podium position in the event that paid points to both the 17-round Supercross season as well as the inaugural 31-round SuperMotocross World Championship. In the opening round of the Eastern Regional 250SX Class Team Honda HRC’s Hunter Lawrence earned the win with a performance that should have his competition worried.

When the gate dropped for the 450SX Class Main Event defending champion Eli Tomac jumped out into the lead with Red Bull KTM’s Aaron Plessinger pressuring him from the start. But 3:25 into the 20-minute plus one lap race a crashed rider necessitated a red flag and a temporary stop to the action. The rules called for a unique staggered re-start. The racers were lined up one after the other according to their race order then thrown back into battle with the wave of a green flag. The starting position order was Tomac Plessinger Anderson Sexton and Red Bull KTM’s Cooper Webb but once back underway Anderson quickly took over second place. Sexton was around Plessinger shortly after and with 13:05 remaining on the race clock Sexton got into the second-place spot.

After Sexton had demonstrated his speed on the Houston track by qualifying first by over a full second and also catching and beating Tomac in their Heat Race it looked like the Texas crowd would see a fight for the lead. But Tomac found some extra speed; he put in laps fast enough to stave off Sexton’s early charge. The gap between the two was 1.6 seconds but soon Sexton was putting in the fastest laps of any rider on the track. When the clock ticked past 6:30 remaining Sexton had whittled the lead down to just half a second and appeared to be looking for a line around Tomac.

But Tomac held tough. The two-time and defending Supercross champion didn’t falter under the pressure. After about one lap with Sexton right on him Tomac pulled back out enough breathing room to ride his own lines. Behind them Anderson and Plessinger held steady while Troy Lee Designs Red Bull GASGAS Factory Racing’s Justin Barcia found a way around Cooper Webb for fifth yet Webb took the spot back before the checkered flag. Tomac scored his third win of 2023 and stretched out his points lead. Sexton nearly backed up his win from the previous round; he kept the bike on two wheels and earned second place points securing second in the 17-round championship standings.

In Eastern Regional 250SX Class racing Hunter Lawrence grabbed the Holeshot but within a few turns Frenchman Red Bull KTM’s Tom Vialle slid from third into the lead. Vialle the two-time and reigning MXGP MX2 class Motocross World Champion found himself leading not only his first Monster Energy AMA Supercross but his first race ever in America. Hunter fought back on the opening lap but misjudged his launch off a triple jump and sent his Honda off the track. Lawrence made an incredible high-speed save through the track-lining Tuff Blox and rejoined the race only losing one position.

Team Honda HRC’s Chance Hymas found himself in second place. The Rookie put immediate pressure on Vialle. But before two minutes had run off the clock in the 15-minute plus one lap Main Event Lawrence had re-taken second from Hymas. Shortly after that pass Hymas had trouble and Fire Power Honda’s Max Anstie took over the third place spot with Muc-Off FXR ClubMX Yamaha’s Jeremy Martin Monster Energy Yamaha Star Racing’s Jordon Smith and rookie Monster Energy Yamaha Star Racing’s Haiden Deegan right behind. Deegan was in his first pro race after competing in the SX Futures class just one week prior.

Smith reeled in Anstie and pressured for the position until he crashed in the sand. With five minutes left on the race clock the top three seemed comfortably in their spots. It was an Australian Brit and a Frenchman looking to make the opening Eastern Regional race an international podium. But in the final laps Smith put on a charge getting around Martin right before Vialle crashed in one of the track’s bowl turns. Martin then crashed on the final lap and the opening round of the Eastern Regional Series ended with Lawrence crossing the finish line in first Anstie in second Smith earning a hard-fought third place and Haiden Deegan grabbing fourth in his first professional race.

The racers face off again next weekend at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa Florida for Round 6 of the 450SX Class and the second round of the Eastern Regional 250SX Class. The event pays points to each class for both the 2023 Monster Energy AMA Supercross season as well as towards the ultimate title the 2023 31-round SuperMotocross World Championship series which combines Supercross Pro Motocross and two SMX Playoffs and Final for an all-new title with a $10 million-dollar total purse.

Monster Energy Kawasaki’s Jason Anderson took the final podium position in the event that paid points to both the 17-round Supercross season as well as the inaugural 31-round SuperMotocross World Championship.

In the opening round of the Eastern Regional 250SX Class Team Honda HRC’s Hunter Lawrence earned the win with a performance that should have his competition worried.

When the gate dropped for the 450SX main event defending champion Eli Tomac jumped out into the lead with Red Bull KTM’s Aaron Plessinger pressuring him from the start.

But 3:25 into the 20-minute plus one lap race a crashed rider necessitated a red flag and a temporary stop to the action. The rules called for a unique staggered re-start. The racers were lined up one after the other according to their race order then thrown back into battle with the wave of a green flag.

The starting position order was Tomac Plessinger Anderson Sexton and Red Bull KTM’s Cooper Webb but once back underway Anderson quickly took over second place. Sexton was around Plessinger shortly after and with 13:05 remaining on the race clock Sexton got into the second-place spot.

After Sexton had demonstrated his speed on the Houston track by qualifying first by over a full second and also catching and beating Tomac in their Heat Race it looked like the Texas crowd would see a fight for the lead.

But Tomac found some extra speed; he put in laps fast enough to stave off Sexton’s early charge. The gap between the two was 1.6 seconds but soon Sexton was putting in the fastest laps of any rider on the track. When the clock ticked past 6:30 remaining Sexton had whittled the lead down to just half a second and appeared to be looking for a line around Tomac.

But Tomac held tough. The two-time and defending Supercross champion didn’t falter under the pressure. After about one lap with Sexton right on him Tomac pulled back out enough breathing room to ride his own lines.

Behind them Anderson and Plessinger held steady while Troy Lee Designs Red Bull GASGAS Factory Racing’s Justin Barcia found a way around Cooper Webb for fifth yet Webb took the spot back before the checkered flag.

Tomac scored his third win in four races this season and stretched his points lead. Sexton nearly backed up his win from the previous round; he kept the bike on two wheels and earned second place points securing second in the 17-round championship standings.

In Eastern Regional 250SX Class racing Hunter Lawrence grabbed the Holeshot but within a few turns Frenchman Red Bull KTM’s Tom Vialle slid from third into the lead. Vialle the two-time and reigning MXGP MX2 class Motocross world champion found himself leading not only his first Monster Energy AMA Supercross but his first race in America.

Hunter fought back on the opening lap but misjudged his launch off a triple jump and sent his Honda off the track. Lawrence made an incredible high-speed save through the track-lining Tuff Blox and rejoined the race only losing one position.

Team Honda HRC’s Chance Hymas found himself in second place. The rookie put immediate pressure on Vialle. But before two minutes had run off the clock in the 15-minute plus one lap main event Lawrence had re-taken second from Hymas. Shortly after that pass Hymas had trouble and Fire Power Honda’s Max Anstie took over the third with Muc-Off FXR ClubMX Yamaha’s Jeremy Martin Monster Energy Yamaha Star Racing’s Jordon Smith and rookie Monster Energy Yamaha Star Racing’s Haiden Deegan right behind. Deegan was in his first pro race after competing in the SX Futures class just one week prior.

Smith reeled in Anstie and pressured for the position until he crashed in the sand. With five minutes left on the race clock the top three seemed comfortably in their spots. It was an Australian Brit and a Frenchman looking to make the opening Eastern Regional race an international podium.

But in the final laps Smith put on a charge getting around Martin right before Vialle crashed in one of the track’s bowl turns. Martin then crashed on the final lap and the opening round of the Eastern Regional Series ended with Lawrence crossing the finish line in first Anstie in second Smith earning a hard-fought third place and Haiden Deegan grabbing fourth in his first professional race.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ob3VzdG9uY2hyb25pY2xlLmNvbS90ZXhhcy1zcG9ydHMtbmF0aW9uL2JyaWFuLXQtc21pdGgvYXJ0aWNsZS9ob3VzdG9uLXRleGFucy1kZW1lY28tcnlhbnMtbWFydGhhLXJ5YW5zLW1vdGhlci0xNzc2MzI2My5waHDSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,DeMeco Ryans: New Texans coach learned early from his mother,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.houstonchronicle.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /texas-sports-nation/brian-t-smith/article/houston-texans-demeco-ryans-martha-ryans-mother-17763263.php (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025625500C70>, 'Connection to www.houstonchronicle.com timed out.

The 450 class has made the trek to NRG Stadium for the fifth round of the 2023 Monster Energy Supercross championship. After Eli Tomac’s disastrous mistake and impressive recovery the points hunt has closed significantly which makes it a whole lot more interesting for the fans. But before the gate drops for the premier class we have to find out who’s fastest amongst the 450 class. The track is fast and short so look forward to high pace action. Scroll down below to find out who’s setting the fastest lap times in NRG Stadium.

450 GROUP A QUALIFYING RESULTS (SESSION 2 OF 2)

Eli thankfully looks healthy after his intense crash from last weekend.

It’s looking like it might be Chase’s weekend as he grabbed the holeshot in the second qualifying session. But as we typed that he nearly wadded in the sand and oj’d the over under so maybe we should watch what we say. But nonetheless Chase still set a 51.67 lap time and a ridiculously fast 50.32 one lap later. Adam Cianciarulo showed up looking really good making his way up to second with a 51.56. The top 5 excluding Chase were fractions of a second off from each other as Dylan Ferrandis Eli Tomac Adam Cianciarulo and Jason Anderson were all in the 51 second margin. Chase would be the fastest rider of the day riding more than a whole second faster than second place’s Dylan Ferrandis.

Chase was the fastest rider of the day by a pretty wide margin. Chase would finish qualifying with one whole second to spare on second place.

450 GROUP A QUALIFYING RESULTS (SESSION 1 OF 2)

Chase was insanely fast in the first qualifying session.

As qualifying begun Chase was quick to set a blistering fast lap time nearly breaking into the 51 second threshold. It took five minutes before anyone was remotely close to his lap time. But as Dylan Ferrandis was .2 of second away from Chase Chase dropped all the way down to 50.79 a second and a half faster than second place. However this wasn’t just a lucky lap for Chase as Chase continued to drop his lap time down to 50.48. Jason Anderson would bump up to second but still more than half a second slower than the leader.

Chrome 110 already supports RTX VSR but NVIDIA still needs to release a new driver.

NVIDIA upscaling technologies will soon enter a new dimension online video streaming will soon be improved with the power of RTX graphics. The company announced that RTX Video Super Resolution will unlock up to 4K AI upscaling with Chrome and Edge Internet browsers.

Google has just released a new early stable version of Chrome (110.0.5481.77) which is now available to a small percentage of users and will see broader release on February 7th (i.e. the actual release).

According to the official changelog Chrome 110 already supports this technology but it will still need a new driver to work. Furthermore it is now confirmed that RTX VSR will only work if enabled by users manually through NVIDIA Control Panel. It will not be enabled by default.

NVIDIA RTX VSR support Source: Chrome

NVIDIA showcased the technology working for YouTube but one can imagine that it will find a much broader use. Technically speaking nothing should stop NVIDIA and Google from allowing VSR to work with GeForce Now or even premium video streaming platforms such as Netflix. That could theoretically allow 4K videos from 1080p source and an opportunity to safe on higher membership tier.

As long as official information is considered RTX VSR will only work with GeForce RTX 30 and RTX 40 graphics cards. The RTX 20 series are also confirmed to be supported later. NVIDIA still needs to release a compatible driver which should happen sometime in late February.

Look no further than the recent surge in any stock associated with the letters “AI.” If ChatGPT is churning out amusing copy it must be a great time to buy “AI stocks” right? Never mind doing any due diligence just search for company names that contain AI. A similar behavior was observed nearly two decades ago when companies with “nano” in the name soared to the moon.

Then there’s the often repeated mistake of ticker confusion which isn’t just about fat fingering the wrong ticker. Researchers have shown remarkable return profiles associated with tickers that look the same. From an article by Quartz:

One spectacular example was when as the researchers document the stock price of Tweeter Home Entertainment Group surged by more than 1000% on Oct. 4 2013. The company traded under the ticker TWTRQ and social media giant Twitter had just filed plans for its IPO—it listed the following month with the ticker TWTR. Credit: Quartz

Even the trading algorithms get it wrong every now and then something known as “the Anne Hathaway Effect.”

The power of a company’s brand can also have an impact on investor perceptions.

Well we may have our first peek at an upcoming desktop GeForce part with some leaked specifications and benchmarks out of Chinese-language forum ChipHell.





Chart from panzerlied at ChipHell translated by @harukaze5719 on Twitter.











Still assuming these results are legitimate this gives us a decent picture of what kind of performance we can expect out of x60-class Ada Lovelace GeForce cards. As expected the AD106 GPU runs an extremely high GPU boost clock and this gives it great compute and raster performance despite being smaller than the GA104 by a fair bit. However it is suffering under a rather extreme memory bandwidth deficit compared to the older cards.









You can see this demonstrated in the 3DMark results where the AD106 chip generally comes out ahead of both TU104 and GA104 in the standard tests at 1080p and 1440p but in Fire Strike Ultra and Time Spy Extreme—which run in native 4K resolution—it falls behind the older GPUs. It also loses out to the GA104 GPU rather badly in the new Speed Way test that makes heavy use of asset streaming. That's likely because of its PCIe 4.0 x8 interface which you can see demonstrated in the PCIe test at the bottom.







3DMark data graphed for easier comparison by @harukaze5719

Posting on the forum user ""panzerlied"" dropped a chart with a comparison of what he claims is a ""borrowed"" graphics card with an AD106 GPU against cards with GA104 and TU104 processors. Those GPUs go into the GeForce RTX 3070 Ti and Geforce RTX 2080  respectively although panzerlied is apparently using a hacked-together GA104 card with 16 GB of underclocked memory so the results don't quite line up with any extant GeForce card.Of course it's not exactly fair to compare the AD106 against the previous-generation TU104 and GA104 parts given that they are clearly a higher tier of product but panzerlied admits that himself. Also as posters in the forum point out it's possible that this GPU could be priced as high as current street prices of RTX 3060 Ti and RTX 3070 cards based on GA104 silicon. If you're intending to play in high resolutions like 4K the older cards could end up being the better buy for you.There's also the consideration that the AD106 part comes out well ahead in the DXR ray-tracing feature test though and that's to say nothing of the new card's support for DLSS 3 frame generation. Furthermore panzerlied says that the performance of this AD106 GPU is probably not final and the market may not look the same in a few months when these cards launch either.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtcm9sbHMtb3V0LXVwZGF0ZS1mb3ItcnR4LTMwLXNlcmllcy1kaXNjb3JkLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLWJ1Zy0xNjUyMjg3ODguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA rolls out update for Discord performance bug,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vZmluYW5jZS55YWhvby5jb20vbmV3cy9udmlkaWEtcm9sbHMtb3V0LXVwZGF0ZS1mb3ItcnR4LTMwLXNlcmllcy1kaXNjb3JkLXBlcmZvcm1hbmNlLWJ1Zy0xNjUyMjg3ODguaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000256274048B0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

But their share prices are certainly high enough to do so.

In addition to being a dismal year for the stock market 2022 might go down as the year of the stock splits. Several well-known companies conducted stock splits last year.

Many investors were especially glad to see Amazon's (AMZN -0.45%) 20-for-1 stock split in June. Could there be another round of stock splits this year? It's possible. Here are three stocks that are even better candidates for stock splits in 2023 than Amazon was last year.

1. NVR

Amazon's share price at the market close before its stock split was $2447. That's certainly a lofty enough level to warrant a split. However it pales in comparison to NVR's (NVR 0.56%) current share price of around $5380. The company has never conducted a stock split but doing so would make its shares more affordable for retail investors.

NVR ranks as one of the biggest residential homebuilders in the U.S. The company serves 35 major metropolitan markets across 15 states and operates under three brands: Ryan Homes NVHomes and Heartland Homes. It also provides mortgage banking services.

You might think that higher interest rates could dampen growth for construction stocks. That hasn't been the case for NVR. The company recently reported that its revenue and earnings soared 22% and 36% year over year respectively in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Although NVR stock fell throughout much of the first three quarters of 2022 it's been on a roll over the last three months. Despite that momentum NVR still appears attractively valued based on its free-cash-flow generation.

2. Seaboard

Seaboard (SEB 3.45%) appears to be another great prospect to conduct a stock split this year. Its share price is hovering around $3940 right now and like NVR Seaboard has never split its shares.

The company is an agricultural and transportation conglomerate with operations on four continents. Its primary businesses include pork production and processing in the U.S. containerized shipping in the Western hemisphere and grain processing and commodity trading in Africa the Caribbean Europe and South America.

Seaboard experienced some challenges related to COVID-19. However its business tends to be relatively stable overall. While the stock market plunged last year Seaboard's share price fared pretty well even with multiple up-and-down swings.

The company's Commodity Trading & Milling segment has recently been its biggest growth driver. But Seaboard's pork and marine transportation businesses have also delivered solid growth.

3. Booking Holdings

Booking Holdings (BKNG -1.41%) has conducted one stock split in its history -- a 1-for-6 reverse stock split back in 2003. Booking looks like a great candidate for a regular stock split now though with its share price close to $2480.

The company was originally called Priceline.com but changed its name in 2018. It's now the top provider of online travel services with six primary brands: Booking.com Priceline OpenTable Rentalcars.com agoda and KAYAK.

Booking stock was hammered throughout much of last year. In 2023 though the online travel company's shares are up more than 20% so far. The company's business continues to boom as worries about COVID-19 wane. Booking's revenue in Q3 2022 jumped 29% year over year and its earnings soared 117%.

Bet on a split?

Some investors love stock splits because they anticipate the moves will provide solid catalysts. Should you bet on a stock split for NVR Seaboard or Booking Holdings? No. All three stocks have traded at high levels for several years without conducting a stock split.

However that doesn't mean none of these stocks are good picks. My favorite of the three is Booking. I think the company's strong growth prospects as the travel industry continues to recover should enable the stock to deliver market-beating returns over the next several years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jaW5jaW5uYXRpLmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDIvMDQvNC1taWxsaW9uLWluZGlhbi1oaWxsLWhvbWUtc2FsZS1hbW9uZy10aGUtd2Vla3MtdG9wLXByb3BlcnR5LXRyYW5zZmVycy82OTg0MjE2NjAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,$4 million Indian Hill home sale among the week's top property transfers,"Cincinnati Enquirer

Or so the past month of dismal earnings might have you believe.

Electronics giant Samsung saw its profits contract 69 percent during the fourth quarter while revenues slumped eight percent overall. South Korean memory manufacturer SK Hynix meanwhile followed a few days later with an equally bleak report. Both companies told a story of macroeconomic forces that were suppressing consumer spending and driving DRAM and NAND flash inventories to unprecedented levels.

Put simply where there was once a chip shortage there is now a glut. Well of memory anyway — more on that later.

Intel AMD and Qualcomm whose top-end chips depend on DRAM and NAND flash and are thus inexorably intertwined saw declines across key markets including PCs smartphones servers and game consoles. If customers aren't buying memory it makes sense they wouldn't be buying PCs and servers to put it in.

While the rapid deterioration of the semiconductor market may have come as a surprise to some the writing has been on the wall for months.

And bear in mind we're talking about memory and high-end components here in this piece – there are still ongoing supply issues and delays with microcontrollers glue electronics and similar low-level components.

Micron was among the first semis to succumb to market forces. After riding strong demand for months and promising tens of billions in new fabs the company decimated its workforce laying off 4800 after its Q1 2023 earnings tumbled 88 percent from the year prior on a nearly $200 million loss.

But even this wasn't the first sign that the pandemic bubble had burst. More than six months prior the industry watchers at TrendForce offered a stark outlook for the memory market warning of growing inventories of yet unsold product. The memory vendors were headed for economic turmoil long before this week.

How did this happen?

The semiconductor industry has for the past three years been caught in a perfect storm that has fueled steady demand.

In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak an entire remote-working economy was born over the course of a few weeks. Every tech and software company worth its salt rushed to capitalize on the shift out of the office.

Security vendors rushed products tailored to home offices out the door; notebook vendors crammed higher resolution cameras and microphones into their wares; and software vendors like Teams and Zoom scrambled to keep their services online. Whether directly or indirectly all of these dynamics fueled semiconductor demand in one capacity or another.

Before long existing inventories emptied and with factories closed due to COVID-19 lockdowns it seemed everything was in short supply. Within a year the semiconductor supply chain was stretched beyond its limits and we were in the full grip of the chip shortage.

To make matters worse — for consumers anyway — the then-current generation of graphics cards proved particularly efficient at mining cryptocurrencies. And while Nvidia and AMD pretended to care about how difficult it was to buy a GPU they were only too happy to collect the massive profits the cards brought in every quarter.

In mid 2022 the bubble burst. It was already getting easier to find components — lead times for basic but essential parts were down below 26 weeks and headed in the right direction — just as the Ethereum merge came. Within a few weeks cryptocurrency valuations collapsed taking GPU prices down with it.

This would have been good news for consumers but the economy had already started to cool. Interest rates were rising; the cost of living was going up; in Europe the war in Ukraine had driven fuel and energy prices to all-time highs. Suddenly folks weren't so keen on buying another new PC or smartphone.

Over the course of a few months demand for ""high-margin"" chips — think CPUs and GPUs — evaporated. To be clear the chip shortage isn't over. It's just that demand — particularly for processors used in consumer hardware — is gone. Supply of many components especially those used for power delivery and automotive environments remain heavily constrained.

The worst has yet to come

Memory fabs' options given the current predicament are limited. These companies have fairly long and complex supply chains and largely compete on pricing and process tech CCS Insights analyst Wayne Lam previously told The Register.

Until things improve Samsung and SK Hynix are focusing on products like LPDDR5 DDR5 and HBM used in mobile next-gen server and high-performance computing products which it anticipates will drive future demand.

By comparison conventional fabs like those operated by TSMC and those not dedicated to memory at Samsung have relatively short straightforward supply chains. This Lam explained gives them greater flexibility to reallocate capacity to chips that are in higher demand.

Despite all of this the next few quarters are looking pretty grim. Over the past few weeks chipmakers and foundry operators have offered a near universally grisly outlook on the quarters to come.

Intel expects its revenues to fall to $11 billion and potentially lower in the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile AMD is predicting flat revenues for Q1 and poor PC and gaming sales throughout the 2023 fiscal year. And this week Qualcomm again blamed the fact nobody is buying phones for its shoddy performance. Even TSMC forecast a revenue drop its first in four years.

The general consensus among these companies seems to be that things should start picking up again in the second half of 2023. But not everyone is so sure. In a recent report Dylan Patel at SemiAnalysis predicted that inventory levels wouldn't return to normal in Q2 and that the bear market for semiconductor companies would stretch on longer than anyone anticipated.

""We believe there is around a 15 percent downside for semiconductor companies' valuations or significant sideways movement before the real bull run can start"" he wrote. ""Days of inventory are currently at all-time highs. Even higher than the dot-com bubble and the 2008 financial crisis. This inventory will take a lot longer than two quarters to digest.""

Patel isn't the only one. In a recent TrendForce report analysts predicted foundry revenues would contract 4 percent in 2023 as wafer demand continues to dry up and inventory consumption slows.

When the semiconductor market does recover the next question will be how quickly. Short of another civilization-altering event it seems we're unlikely to see the kind of pandemic-level investment in IT that fueled so much of the semiconductor demand over the past three years.

Why all the fabs then?

Given the perilous state the semiconductor space appears to be in it may surprise many to see chipmakers like Samsung TSMC and Intel pushing ahead on fab projects.

These facilities aren't cheap by any stretch of the imagination — prices are often measured in the tens of billions of dollars just to build even one fab. So you'd think these would have been the first on the chopping block. If nobody is buying chips why are you building more fabs? But that's exactly what they're doing.

Intel may be trying to get more cash out of the German government but they are — for the moment anyway — still committed to building a new fab there. And despite the poor quarter Samsung said it's pushing ahead with its foundry expansions including its new operation in Texas. SK Hynix has committed to building a US packaging facility. TSMC has scaled back its capex plans for the 2023 fiscal year but it still plans to spend between $32 billion and $36 billion on new infrastructure. If you're wondering that's between $4 billion and $8 billion less than in 2022.

While it might sound like poor business sense it's important to remember just how large and complex these facilities are. They're not just buildings. They're filled with sophisticated highly-regulated equipment that takes time to acquire install and validate. Most of the 20-or-so fabs announced to date won't come online before 2025.

It certainly doesn't hurt that the US and Europe are funneling tens of billions into domestic chip production in a bid to reduce their reliance on the Asia Pacific fabs before tensions with China boil over. ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vaW5ub3ZhdGlvbm9yaWdpbnMuY29tL2VuL2xhaW8vaG93LXBoaWxpcHMtc3Bpbi1vZmZzLW91dHNob25lLXRoZS1tb3RoZXItY29tcGFueS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Philips spin-offs outshone the mother company,"Philips a Dutch multinational technology company founded in 1891 has spun off many successful companies such as ASML NXP and Signify.

The Birth of ASML

In 1984 ASML spun off from Philips intending to produce lithography machines used by chip manufacturers like NXP and Intel for the production of chips. These machines allow customers to produce chips with the highest performance and lowest product costs which is essential in today’s competitive semiconductor industry.

ASML has invested heavily in research and development (R&D) and adopted a three-pillar operational strategy – technology leadership customer and supplier intimacy and entrepreneurial people. This strategy has enabled them to develop increasingly sophisticated equipment that has allowed them to achieve an 80% market share in the semiconductor industry at unprecedented speed.

The Impact of Spin-Offs on Brainport Eindhoven Region

The success of spin-off companies such as ASML NXP and Signify has had a positive impact on the Brainport Eindhoven region. The more than one thousand startups located in Eindhoven have created at least 25000 jobs since 2019. The city is now home to numerous high-tech companies focusing on robotics photonics and medtech.

The exceptional success of start-ups in Brainport Eindhoven can directly be linked to the characteristics and conditions of the region The above-average success of start-ups from the Brainport Eindhoven region can be directly linked to the specific characteristics and conditions within the region. The high … Continued

The Technical University of Eindhoven (TU) is a major source of technical expertise for these start-ups. Many of these start-ups are located in former Philips factory buildings like the Klokgebouw High tech Campus Eindhoven or Strijp-T. Smart Photonics is working on photonics to make the light sector more sustainable while Xeltis produces plastic heart valves which will eventually be replaced by body cells. Sendcloud is an e-commerce business with a valuation of 665 million euros.

What Could Philips Have Done Differently?

By ‘liberating’ the spin-offs from the mother company Philips has ensured them to become successful and to outshine their mother company. At the same time Philips itself could have learned more from the operations methods of these spin-offs. By adopting a simple business strategy investing heavily in R&D and committing to a three-pillar operational strategy ASML was able to deliver increasingly sophisticated equipment which enabled them to achieve an 80% market share in the semiconductor industry at unprecedented speed.

Medtech

Philips has shifted its focus from consumer electronics to medical technology in the past decade. This strategic move has brought the company a leading position in several medtech markets. Philips has established itself as a global health technology leader with an impressive portfolio of 57000 patent rights 33000 trademarks 114000 design rights and 2900 domain names. The company has ranked in the top 10 of the European Patent Office (EPO) for many consecutive years.

All-in-all the success of spin-off companies such as ASML NXP and Signify and Philips’ choice to go from consumer electronics to medtech have benefited Brainport Eindhoven region. However Philips could have done more to copy their spin-offs’ success outshining their mother company.

(2023 Updated),"AutoZone is a major seller of automotive parts.

If you are looking to make a purchase from an AutoZone near you you probably want to make sure you are getting a good deal.

Price matching can be a great way to do that.

Does AutoZone Price Match?

AutoZone does price match with local competitors.

Some stores that they price match with include Walmart O’Reilly and Napa.

However they don’t match with stores that are outside of the area or online competitors.

They also will not price match with their own online parts retailer autozone.com.

This means that there are some things you will need to keep in mind when asking AutoZone for a price match.

Make sure to come with proof of the lower price and ensure the price you are coming with is from a local competitor.

How To Price Match At AutoZone

The first thing you are going to want to do is to find out what your local AutoZone is charging for the item you want to buy.

This can be done by calling them up or going into the location and asking.

It is important to make sure that AutoZone has the part you want in stock.

They will only price match on parts that are already in stock not parts they need to order.

You then want to check out the other shops in the area and get prices on the part.

The price has to be from a select company that AutoZone has already decided to price match.

This typically includes the major local competitors in the area.

You can ask your AutoZone which stores they will price match with.

You are going to need proof of the price for AutoZone to match it.

The most common way to do this is to bring in an advertisement that displays the piece along with its price.

Take your proof of price to the manager and ask them to price match you on the product.

Is Autozone Price Matching Worth It?

Price matching can seem like a great life hack.

It can be very empowering to get a company to lower its price.

However there are some situations where it might not be worth it.

If the competitor with the lower price is close by and has the product in stock it probably just makes more sense to get it at that store.

After all asking a manager to price match does take time and effort.

Price matching might be worth it if you are buying multiple parts.

For example if you are buying three car parts and AutoZone has the lowest price for two of them it can be worth it to ask them to price match the other part.

This will save you time from having to go to another store.

Another situation in which price-matching might be worth it is if you find an advertisement for a lower-priced part but the part in question is out of stock at the original store.

When you go in all you have to do is present the advertisement as proof of the competitor’s price.

You aren’t required to prove that the item is in stock.

A third situation in which price matching might be worth it is when you are a part of a loyalty program with a certain store.

For example AutoZone has a rewards program.

After five qualifying purchases you earn a $20 reward.

If you frequently make purchases for your car those rewards can add up!

In that case it will make more sense to buy at one store than many different stores when possible.

A fourth situation in which price matching will make sense is if you happen to see an advertisement for a cheap part when you are already planning to go to AutoZone.

In this case it doesn’t take you any extra effort to go to the store and ask them to price match the product.

Does AutoZone Do Price Adjustments?

Price matching is when a store matches the price of a competitor for an identical product.

Price adjustment is when a store lowers the price of a product to match prices from the same retailer.

For example if you notice that the windshield wipers at the AutoZone 30 minutes away are cheaper than the same ones at the AutoZone 15 minutes away you are out of luck.

AutoZone won’t price match itself.

Does AutoZone Price Match For Online Retailers?

AutoZone does not price match for online retailers.

This includes their own online store autozone.com.

When you buy parts at your local AutoZone part of what you are paying for is the convenience of getting the part immediately.

It is also easier to do returns when you buy a product in person.

You don’t have to wait for delivery or pay shipping fees.

Are There Any Cases In Which AutoZone Won’t Match A Local Competitor’s Price?

If the local competitor isn’t on the list of companies that AutoZone considers for price matching they will not match that competitor’s price on a product.

AutoZone also requires that the features of the product be exactly the same along with the warranty.

What Are The Best Stores To Search For Price Matches?

If you want to price match a product at AutoZone the best stores to look for lower prices are going to typically be Walmart or O’Reilly Auto Parts.

While AutoZone will also price match Napa Napa typically sells products for higher prices than AutoZone so it is unusual to find a good price matching opportunity when looking at Napa’s products.

O’Reilly tends to have very similar prices with AutoZone because they are quite close competitors.

However sometimes O’Reilly does have lower prices and you can use them to get a price match at AutoZone.

Walmart will usually be the best option for finding a good price to match.

Even though Walmart is not exclusively an auto shop it sells many of the same products as AutoZone.

Walmart is known for trying to provide the lowest prices possible which is why it is a good option for price matching.

Additionally there are typically multiple Walmart locations within a short distance from AutoZone stores that AutoZone may consider for a price match.

Does O’Reilly Auto Do Price Matching?

AutoZone will price match a local O’Reilly store but what about the other way around?

O’Reilly’s price matching policy is almost identical to AutoZone’s.

They will price match most local competitors but will not price match online retailers.

O’Reilly also will not do price adjustments.

The pricing at each local store is determined by several factors that vary based on location.

One advantage of shopping at O’Reilly Auto Parts is that they have a 10% military discount.

If you have served in the military or are a dependent of someone who is serving in the military you qualify for this 10% discount.

Does AutoZone Have A Military Discount?

Unlike O’Reilly AutoZone does not have an official military discount.

You could use O’Reilly’s military discount to try and negotiate an extra 10% off of your purchase on the basis of price matching.

The results aren’t guaranteed but there is no harm in asking.

While AutoZone doesn’t have an official military discount some military personnel have reported they have received a 5% to 15% unofficial discount in certain AutoZone locations.

These discounts are at the cashier or store manager’s discretion.

If a manager seems hesitant to give you a discount try framing it as a price match for O’Reilly Auto Parts.

Can I Bring My Own Parts To My Mechanic?

If you are looking to buy car parts chances are you have a car that needs some work done!

If you are having a mechanic do the work is it better to buy the part directly from the mechanic or to buy it yourself at a shop like AutoZone?

While you might be able to save money by buying your own parts from a shop like AutoZone if you aren’t doing the work yourself it is typically better to buy parts through your mechanic.

1. Cost

One of the reasons it is better to buy your car parts through your mechanic is that it could save you a lot of money in the long run.

Your mechanic knows exactly what parts your car needs.

They also know what parts are higher in quality and will last longer.

If you buy the same part at AutoZone it might be slightly cheaper.

However the auto shop might charge you a higher rate for their labor to make up for the money they are losing by not selling you the part.

Bringing your own parts to an auto shop is kind of like bringing your own ingredients to a restaurant to try and save money.

Another thing to consider is that mechanics have more experience than you do when it comes to sourcing parts.

It could take you hours to find a good deal on a part while a great mechanic will already be buying parts for the best deal they can find.

2. Warranty

Many mechanics will not provide a warranty if you bring your own parts.

After all if you bring a low-quality part to the auto shop why should the mechanic be responsible for its failure?

Unless you are an expert on cars yourself your relationship with a good honest and reliable mechanic is worth more than a couple of bucks saved on a part.

If you really want to save money you could try asking the auto shop to price match AutoZone on the part.

Where Can I Get The Cheapest Car Parts?

If you are determined to fix or build a car yourself the place you are going to likely find the most affordable car parts is online.

Many brick-and-mortar retailers are having trouble keeping up with the kind of low prices that online retailers are able to provide.

When you buy parts online you can quickly compare prices across a variety of different websites.

This helps you find the best deals more quickly than going into different physical stores to compare.

Not only that but you don’t have to spend money on gas by driving around town to different stores.

It’s important to take shipping costs into account.

The website will often only show you the base price of the product not the shipping costs and sales tax.

If you put the item in your cart and go to check out you can see how much shipping will cost you.

Time is also going to play a big factor in whether online parts purchases make sense for you.

If you are building your own car from scratch as a hobby you might be able to wait a while for parts to be delivered.

However if you are looking to fix your only vehicle that is broken down you might want to pay a little more to get the part immediately at a brick-and-mortar location.

Why Are Car Parts Cheaper Online?

The reason buying car parts online is typically significantly cheaper has to do with the fact that online retailers typically have much lower overhead costs than brick-and-mortar retailers.

An online retailer often sells products via a method called “drop shipping.”

This is when the product is shipped directly from the distributor to the consumer.

When companies sell online they don’t have to pay rent for a store location or the salaries of employees who run the store.

Because they don’t have these additional costs (called overhead) they can sell products for much less than brick-and-mortar stores while making the same profit.

Is It Safe To Buy Car Parts Online?

As we mentioned in the mechanic section there are safety concerns to consider when buying car parts.

If you want the savings of online shopping without the risk of buying from a completely unknown retailer it is best to stick with online stores that have strong reputations.

For example autozone.com can save you money on your purchase while still providing the reliability and peace of mind you have when buying products inside an AutoZone store.

With both sadness and celebration of a life well-lived we announce the passing of David R. Martin at 91 years young. His family and friends’ hearts ache to have lost the presence of such a great man.

David “Dave” was an energy industry leader since the mid-1950s having earned his master’s in geology at UCLA after serving in the USAF during the Korean War.

Along with several other young geologists he was hired by Armand Hammer and then helped build Occidental Petroleum (OXY) from a small drilling company in Bakersfield California to the significant international exploration and production corporation it is today finally retiring as the president of OXY’s Oil & Gas Division.

David was a visionary leader who had a nose for finding new oil reserves and for finding opportunity where others saw only obstacles. One of his discoveries was and continues to be the largest oil field in all South America.

He was passionate about his work and proud of helping to create value in the world.

He was among the best storytellers of all time and considering his many international adventures and his skill in diplomacy and deal-making with foreign governments his stories were the stuff of legends.

David was a devoted husband of nearly 68 years to Sarah “Sally” Martin whom he cherished and loved deeply and together they spent many years supporting the arts and assembling an impressive collection of California Regionalist painting primarily watercolors of Depression-era California scenes.

He was an inspirational father to his two sons Jon and Mat and their wives Michele and Karen; a beloved grandfather to Sarah Nathan Anna and Leah; and a generous friend to many. He was fortunate enough to have his family living close by in Santa Barbara.

David died peacefully at home on Feb. 1 2023 with family at his side after a 20-plus year battle with prostate cancer.

Born on May 9 1931 he was a native Californian who liked to tell of his childhood growing up on a farm in rural San Fernando Valley catching crawdads in the free flowing LA River.

David will be deeply missed by his family friends and all who knew him. His legacy of success hard work generosity love and compassion will live on in the hearts of those he touched.

A graveside service to celebrate David’s life will be held at the Santa Barbara Cemetery 10:30 a.m. Tuesday Feb. 7.

You can get stories like this one straight to your inbox every Thursday morning by subscribing here.

To avoid the worst predicted effects of climate change climate experts say we need to not only reduce our greenhouse gas emissions but also remove and sequester carbon that’s already been released in the atmosphere.

There are more or less natural ways to do this — we can plant more trees (maybe even genetically engineered ones) tweak farm soil to suck up more carbon or spread green sand on beaches. Or we can pull carbon from the atmosphere using huge machines known as direct air capture (DAC) technologies.

Direct air capture: While the specifics vary DAC systems typically use fans to pull in air from the atmosphere. The carbon in it then reacts with and binds to a chemical in the system. Heat can then be applied to the chemical to release the carbon for storage or reuse and the rest of the material is returned to capture more CO2.

Unlike forests farms or beaches CO2 removal facilities aren’t beholden to geographical constraints — the amount of carbon in the air is very similar across the planet so we can establish them virtually anywhere.

And while a wildfire or logging operation can release a forest’s stored carbon DAC gives us the opportunity to store concentrated CO2 someplace more permanent such as deep underground or in products like concrete.

The challenge: Despite these benefits direct CO2 removal still hasn’t really taken off — as of 2020 the world’s 15 operational DAC facilities were pulling a total of about 9000 tonnes of CO2 from the air annually which is about as much as 2000 cars generate per year.

“We’re going to need to remove 10 gigatonnes of CO2 per year by 2050.” Jane Zelikova

To have a serious impact on our climate situation we’re going to need to capture a lot more carbon than that.

“Current models suggest we’re going to need to remove 10 gigatonnes of CO2 per year by 2050 and by the end of the century that number needs to double to 20 gigatonnes per year” Jane Zelikova a climate scientist at the University of Wyoming told BBC News in 2021.

“[Right now] we’re removing virtually none” she continued. “We’re having to scale from zero.”

The startup: A major reason for this slow progress is that carbon accounts for just .04% of our air. That low concentration makes extracting it from the open air an expensive engineering challenge — removal costs between $100 and $1000 per tonne according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Scaling up CO2 removal tech could lower costs making investments in DAC more attractive to governments or corporations looking to offset their emissions — and Swiss startup Climeworks is leading the way on that front.

In September 2021 it opened Orca the world’s largest CO2 removal plant in Iceland. On its own that facility can remove 4000 tonnes of CO2 per year — nearly half of what all other plants are pulling combined.

An independent third-party auditor recently confirmed that Climeworks had removed CO2 from the air at that plant and put it into the ground for permanent storage for paying customers — something no other group has done before.

“Today’s announcement of Climeworks’ first verified deliveries is an important step for DAC and it represents the culmination of years of investment from the Climeworks team” said Zeke Hausfather climate research lead at fintech company Stripe one of Climeworks’ customers.

Climeworks’ goal is to reach multi-megatonne capacity by 2030 and gigatonne capacity by 2050 and while Orca is still far short of that the startup has already broken ground on an even bigger CO2 removal plant in Iceland.

This one Mammoth will be capable of pulling 36000 tonnes of carbon from the air annually once fully operational. Construction is expected to take 18-24 months and once up and running the plant will be powered 100% by renewable energy just like Orca.

“Nobody has ever built what we are building in DAC and we are both humble and realistic that the most certain way to be successful is to run the technology in the real world as fast as possible” said Christoph Gebald Climeworks co-founder and co-CEO.

In late 2021 Congress authorized $3.5 billion in funding to build four DAC hubs across the US.

The big picture: Climeworks might be leading the charge at scaling up direct carbon capture tech but we could soon enter an era when the record for largest plant is broken again and again.

Canadian startup Carbon Engineering and US oil company Occidental Petroleum are building a DAC plant in Texas that’s expected to be operational by 2024 — initially it will be capable of capturing 500000 tonnes of CO2 annually but it could be scaled up to 1 million tonnes.

The US is expected to get several more CO2 removal plants soon too.

In late 2021 Congress authorized $3.5 billion in funding to build four DAC hubs — it’s currently seeking proposals for plants capable of capturing and storing at least 1 million tonnes of CO2 annually.

One of the companies that has announced plans to bid on the project California’s CarbonCapture is already building another DAC plant in Wyoming that’s expected to become operational in 2023.

Initially that plant will be capable of capturing 12000 tonnes of CO2 a year but the company says that it plans to continually add modules that will increase its capacity to 5 million tonnes annually by 2030.

Again that’s still far short of the 10 gigatonnes of CO2 experts say we need to be removing every year by 2050 but if the tech continues to scale — and governments and corporations continue to invest — getting there wouldn’t be impossible.

“I think if the world sets its mind to it we can produce many of these plants” Carbon Engineering’s CEO Steve Oldham told Yale Environment 360. “And we’ve done this in the past. Look at the way we scrambled for COVID vaccines. Or look at the way we scrambled for wars and got into the mass production of planes.”

North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency said Monday that members of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Politburo met on Saturday and agreed to hold a larger plenary meeting of the party’s Central Committee in late February to review strategies on agriculture and set new goals. It said the Politburo members acknowledged a “a turning point is needed to dynamically promote the radical change in agricultural development.”

“It is a very important and urgent task to establish the correct strategy for the development of agriculture and take relevant measures for the immediate farming … to promote the overall development of socialist construction” the KCNA said.

The Politburo meeting came amid indications that the country was preparing to stage a massive military parade in Pyongyang possibly this week to glorify the rule of leader Kim Jong Un and his growing collection of nuclear-capable weapons which he has aggressively pushed to expand despite limited resources and economic decay.

Although not unprecedented it’s uncommon for North Korea to hold two different party plenaries in a span of two months. It’s also rare for North Korea to call a plenary meeting over a single agenda this time agriculture South Korean Unification Ministry spokesperson Koo Byoungsam said in a briefing.

“The government will closely watch North Korea’s food situation and internal trends” said Koo. He said South Korea estimates that North Korean food production fell by about 4% in 2022 to 4.5 million tons.

Following the collapse of nuclear negotiations with the United States in 2019 Kim declared to strengthen his nuclear weapons and missile program against “gangster-like” U.S. sanctions and pressure and urged his nation to stay resilient in the struggle for economic self-reliance.

But the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic unleashed further shock on North Korea’s already broken economy by forcing the nation to shield its poor healthcare system with strict border controls that choked off trade with China its main ally and economic lifeline. The country was also hit with devastating typhoons and floods in 2020 that decimated crops.

In a study published on the North Korea-focused 38 North website last month analyst Lucas Rengifo-Keller said food insecurity in North Korea is likely at its worst since the country's 1990s famine that killed hundreds of thousands of people.

It’s difficult to establish an accurate assessment of North Korea’s humanitarian needs considering the closed nature of its regime and the poor quality of the limited statistics it discloses. But North Korea’s grain balance estimates issued by U.N. agencies and outside governments as well as possibly sharp increases in rice and corn prices observed by NGOs and media indicate that “country’s food supply has probably failed to satisfy minimum human needs” Rengifo-Keller wrote.

Russia’s war on Ukraine likely worsened the situation by driving up global prices of food energy and fertilizer on which North Korea’s agricultural production is heavily dependent.

“Put simply North Korea teeters on the brink of famine” Rengifo-Keller said.

The Workers’ Party’s Central Committee also held a plenary meeting in December when Kim doubled down on his nuclear ambitions by calling an “exponential increase” of nuclear warheads mass production of battlefield tactical nukes targeting rival South Korea and the development of more powerful long-range missiles designed to reach the U.S. mainland. Party members also during the meeting identified key economic projects for 2023 highlighted by agricultural and construction activities.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNvaW5yZXB1YmxpYy5jb20vMjAyMy8wMi8wNS9vY2NpZGVudGFsLXBldHJvbGV1bS1zdG9jay1kb3duLW92ZXItMS01MC1vbi1pbnRyYWRheS1iYXNpYy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Occidental Petroleum Stock Down Over 1.50% on Intraday Basic,"OXY stock struggled and slipped 1.97% in the last trading session.

Since the Russia and Ukraine war started global oil companies have mirrored a hike in their profit as for a certain period of time oil export from Russia was halted or countries were fearing to purchase oil from them.

Russia is the leading oil supplier in the global oil market and due to the war situation the global oil market was affected. However the market tried hard to control the volatility and at some point it was successful.

Don’t go to TikTok.

Despite the social media app exploding in popularity it’s difficult for brands to effectively use the platform during the big game itself. Why? It’s extremely different from other “turnkey” social platforms like Twitter where it is easy to quickly engage users in real-time with text or images says Noah Mallin chief strategy officer of social media agency IMGN Media.

That’s a big problem and it’s essential that brands crack the code as the video sharing app owned by Chinese company ByteDace attracts more than 1 billion users each month.

“On TikTok the potential to be seen [by users] is much greater than on Twitter but the lift is a lot higher than something like Twitter because [TikTok] is a video-based platform” says Mallin. “So you have to be ready to create a video around it. Even though the content looks pretty straightforward it requires sophistication and knowledge of how videos on the platform are constructed to make it really work.”

There are major incentives for brands to step up their game on the social network. No. 1: TikTok makes particular sense for marketers to use during sports events as the platform’s recent U.S. Sports Fandom and Events Insights Survey found that 57% of users watch sports content there weekly. Its Global Olympics and Sports Survey found that six in 10 TikTok users say watching sports content on the platform can be more entertaining than watching sports itself.

No. 2: nearly half (47%) of consumers say they pay “full attention” to TikTok which is 21% higher than other platforms according to TikTok’s Time Well Spent study conducted by Kantar. TikTok users spent 25% more time with ads on TikTok watching almost half before scrolling away according to TikTok’s Brand Building research conducted by DIRT.

Unlike Twitter TikTok requires a user’s full attention with many videos requiring the sound on meaning it’s not a second screen while watching TV.

To meet this challenge Mallin says brands shouldn’t think of TikTok as a marketing tool to use during an event like the Super Bowl. Instead the opportunity is post-game and pre-game.

“Post-game TikTok is a hotbed of trending sounds and moments so if something happens during the game that is notable and leads to organic content being created that starts to trend that is an opportunity for brands if it makes sense” says Mallin.

IMGN Media client Panasonic does not have TikTok content planned for before or during the Super Bowl but Mallin’s team is planning to keep a close eye on what happens during the game to see if anything aligns with topics that are important to the brand. These could include sustainability or technology for problem solving.

Some brands are very active on TikTok before the big game. One using TikTok as a central platform before the Super Bowl is Quaker Oats whose PR partner is FleishmanHillard. Using TikTok as an extension of its campaign is a key strategy to drive fan engagement and capitalize on trends that start within the app says Jessie Rau director of communications for Quaker Foods North America.

Working closely with TikTok to leverage its business tools and features allowed Quaker to craft an integrated media strategy from the planning phase through the execution of influencer contracts organic content and paid media she says.

The oatmeal brand in partnership with NFL legend Eli Manning is inviting fans to share how they “pregrain” before the big game for a chance to attend next year’s Super Bowl LVIII. To enter the Quaker Pregrain Contest fans can visit TikTok to follow @Quaker between January 30 and February 12 2023 and upload their own “pregrain” video.



Quaker Oats has posted videos featuring Manning in the past week to promote the contest.

“In previous years we have leveraged influencers to share our Super Bowl efforts on [TikTok] but this year’s execution allows us to meet consumers where they already are and where we know trends originate to inspire not only engagement but consumer action” says Rau.

Ending the campaign on the day of the Super Bowl allows Quaker Oats to take advantage of the buzz and energy before the event.

“We plan to encourage others to show us how they pregrain and enter the contest all the way through the big game and will do so by interacting with fans and brands in real-time” says Rau. “We started that engagement when the contest opened and will continue until after the game in order to capture the culmination of how fans incorporate Quaker into their creative pre-game rituals in real-time.”

Interactive campaigns are “the future of marketing” and more brands are taking advantage of that insight adds Rau.

“Entertaining fans during cultural events like the Super Bowl is now elevated to live fan engagement” Rau says. “Consumers are excited by the potential for their involvement in timely brand activations.”

Doritos is also involving fans in its Super Bowl LVII plans adding content created for the platform into its big game paid media activation. The snack brand’s campaign stars rapper and actor Jack Harlow and challenges consumers with the Doritos Triangle Tryouts a TikTok dance-off where they can share their “best triangle-inspired dance on TikTok.”

The dance is based on TikTok dancer @vibin.wit.tay’s routine. The highest-scoring dance will be crowned the winner and their final video will appear in a Super Bowl commercial during the game on Fox.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Like US trade restrictions imposed in October  the most recent export controls aim not only to prevent China from obtaining high-performance chips but also to hold China back in developing the ability to produce them.

The United States secured a deal with the Netherlands and Japan last week to restrict China’s access to certain advanced chip-making equipment dimming Beijing’s hopes of circumventing previous sanctions by importing non-US technologies.

As the US pushes to keep China from getting the latest chip-making technology tightened sanctions could cause Chinese semiconductor and AI development to fall decades behind according to industry insiders.

One of the main targets of the measures is China’s artificial intelligence development which requires powerful computer chips.

For instance Nvidia A100 and H100 chips with built-in infrastructure for training artificial intelligence models and algorithms including computer vision natural language processing and conversational AI have been banned from export to the Chinese market since last August.

Just after the October restrictions went into effect Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) suspended production of two Chinese-designed AI chips believed to be able to outperform and serve as potential alternatives to the A100.

The sanctions have led to an imminent shortage of high-performance chips pushing up the price of those still available draining profit margins and dissuading potential clients according to the founder of an AI software start-up in China who did not want to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.

“Our cost to buy chips has gone up five to six times” he said.

He said in the long run fears of violating sanctions could force large companies to redesign their products or even withdraw and small and medium-sized companies could face severe difficulties with many going bankrupt.

Even those that survived would see their R&D funds cut and innovation capacity weakened and the whole sector would shrink he added.

“In my opinion it was a ‘blitz strike’ for the Americans to effectively exploit the Chinese AI sector’s dependence on US-controlled global design and manufacturing systems” the AI start-up founder said.

He added that while the sanctions hurt market players badly they posed much less of a problem to non-market players such as military AI researchers. Military users generally have fewer constraints when it comes to size weight and power consumption allowing multiple older chips to take the place of one advanced chip.

“The impact of the sanctions on the military would be in the long term” he said while noting that an environment that allows civilian technologies to flourish would provide a better foundation for the development of military applications.

US export authorities cited the chip technology’s military potential as the reason for sanctions saying it could be used to produce weapons of mass destruction and advanced military systems improve military decision making planning and logistics and “commit human rights abuses”.

The Pentagon’s 2022 “China Military Power Report” lists some of the ways the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) could use AI including “multi domain precision warfare” to quickly identify vulnerabilities in the US operational system and combine joint forces to launch a strike.

The PLA could also use AI for “cognitive domain operations” to create deep fakes disseminate propaganda analyse public sentiment online and run bot networks on social media the report said.

Since the tech war kicked off in 2019 China has turned to non-US suppliers.

In 2021 alone Chinese buyers bought US$2.17 billion worth of chip-making equipment from Netherlands-based ASML Holding the world’s leading manufacturer of photolithography systems. That was despite an existing Dutch government ban blocking the company from selling its most advanced machinery to China.

The tightened sanctions leave China no option but to build a self-sufficient semiconductor industry.

Alan Estevez the US Commerce Department’s undersecretary for industry and security said in December that the export controls would “slow” China but just “for a period of time”.

“They will figure this out” he said. “But what we’ve done is pretty comprehensive.”

According to analysts China’s independent semiconductor industry will start at a disadvantage compared to global leaders and the sanctions will cause it to fall further behind.

Wu said that without foreign technology it would take at least 20 years for China’s semiconductor industry to regain lost ground and narrow the technological gap to what it is now with China lagging by about three generations.

He said silicon-based semiconductor chips could continue to advance for about 15 to 20 more years before potential replacement technologies such as non-silicon semiconductors or quantum computing  could mature and enter industrial-scale production.

There are physical limits to silicon chip density or the number of components that can fit on an integrated circuit. As industry leaders approach the limit improvement becomes exponentially more difficult potentially giving latecomers like China a chance to catch up.

Beijing is reportedly preparing a 1 trillion yuan (US$143 billion) support package to invest in its semiconductor industry to achieve self-sufficiency in chips and counter the impact of the US sanctions

“The catch-up is not possible unless the latecomer can pursue it at any cost and be persistent for decades and the investment could carry on even without any profit which is almost impractical” Wu said.

“There is no better way for the Chinese side to get out of this predicament or to accelerate development than to subsidise and subsidies plus time is the only way out but this is a very inefficient approach.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXJlZ2lzdGVyLmNvbS8yMDIzLzAyLzA0L3NlbWljb25kdWN0b3JfbWFya2V0X2J1YmJsZS_SAUdodHRwczovL3d3dy50aGVyZWdpc3Rlci5jb20vQU1QLzIwMjMvMDIvMDQvc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvcl9tYXJrZXRfYnViYmxlLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Semiconductor world in for a rough ride as chip bubble bursts at the high end,"Analysis The semiconductor gold rush is all but over at the high end and we've had our fill. Or so the past month of dismal earnings might have you believe.

Electronics giant Samsung saw its profits contract 69 percent during the fourth quarter while revenues slumped eight percent overall. South Korean memory manufacturer SK Hynix meanwhile followed a few days later with an equally bleak report. Both companies told a story of macroeconomic forces that were suppressing consumer spending and driving DRAM and NAND flash inventories to unprecedented levels.

Put simply where there was once a chip shortage there is now a glut. Well of memory anyway — more on that later.

Intel AMD and Qualcomm whose top-end chips depend on DRAM and NAND flash and are thus inexorably intertwined saw declines across key markets including PCs smartphones servers and game consoles. If customers aren't buying memory it makes sense they wouldn't be buying PCs and servers to put it in.

While the rapid deterioration of the semiconductor market may have come as a surprise to some the writing has been on the wall for months.

And bear in mind we're talking about memory and high-end components here in this piece – there are still ongoing supply issues and delays with microcontrollers glue electronics and similar low-level components.

Micron was among the first semis to succumb to market forces. After riding strong demand for months and promising tens of billions in new fabs the company decimated its workforce laying off 4800 after its Q1 2023 earnings tumbled 88 percent from the year prior on a nearly $200 million loss.

But even this wasn't the first sign that the pandemic bubble had burst. More than six months prior the industry watchers at TrendForce offered a stark outlook for the memory market warning of growing inventories of yet unsold product. The memory vendors were headed for economic turmoil long before this week.

How did this happen?

The semiconductor industry has for the past three years been caught in a perfect storm that has fueled steady demand.

In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak an entire remote-working economy was born over the course of a few weeks. Every tech and software company worth its salt rushed to capitalize on the shift out of the office.

Security vendors rushed products tailored to home offices out the door; notebook vendors crammed higher resolution cameras and microphones into their wares; and software vendors like Teams and Zoom scrambled to keep their services online. Whether directly or indirectly all of these dynamics fueled semiconductor demand in one capacity or another.

Before long existing inventories emptied and with factories closed due to COVID-19 lockdowns it seemed everything was in short supply. Within a year the semiconductor supply chain was stretched beyond its limits and we were in the full grip of the chip shortage.

To make matters worse — for consumers anyway — the then-current generation of graphics cards proved particularly efficient at mining cryptocurrencies. And while Nvidia and AMD pretended to care about how difficult it was to buy a GPU they were only too happy to collect the massive profits the cards brought in every quarter.

In mid 2022 the bubble burst. It was already getting easier to find components — lead times for basic but essential parts were down below 26 weeks and headed in the right direction — just as the Ethereum merge came. Within a few weeks cryptocurrency valuations collapsed taking GPU prices down with it.

This would have been good news for consumers but the economy had already started to cool. Interest rates were rising; the cost of living was going up; in Europe the war in Ukraine had driven fuel and energy prices to all-time highs. Suddenly folks weren't so keen on buying another new PC or smartphone.

Over the course of a few months demand for ""high-margin"" chips — think CPUs and GPUs — evaporated. To be clear the chip shortage isn't over. It's just that demand — particularly for processors used in consumer hardware — is gone. Supply of many components especially those used for power delivery and automotive environments remain heavily constrained.

The worst has yet to come

Memory fabs' options given the current predicament are limited. These companies have fairly long and complex supply chains and largely compete on pricing and process tech CCS Insights analyst Wayne Lam previously told The Register.

Until things improve Samsung and SK Hynix are focusing on products like LPDDR5 DDR5 and HBM used in mobile next-gen server and high-performance computing products which it anticipates will drive future demand.

By comparison conventional fabs like those operated by TSMC and those not dedicated to memory at Samsung have relatively short straightforward supply chains. This Lam explained gives them greater flexibility to reallocate capacity to chips that are in higher demand.

Despite all of this the next few quarters are looking pretty grim. Over the past few weeks chipmakers and foundry operators have offered a near universally grisly outlook on the quarters to come.

Intel expects its revenues to fall to $11 billion and potentially lower in the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile AMD is predicting flat revenues for Q1 and poor PC and gaming sales throughout the 2023 fiscal year. And this week Qualcomm again blamed the fact nobody is buying phones for its shoddy performance. Even TSMC forecast a revenue drop its first in four years.

The general consensus among these companies seems to be that things should start picking up again in the second half of 2023. But not everyone is so sure. In a recent report Dylan Patel at SemiAnalysis predicted that inventory levels wouldn't return to normal in Q2 and that the bear market for semiconductor companies would stretch on longer than anyone anticipated.

""We believe there is around a 15 percent downside for semiconductor companies' valuations or significant sideways movement before the real bull run can start"" he wrote. ""Days of inventory are currently at all-time highs. Even higher than the dot-com bubble and the 2008 financial crisis. This inventory will take a lot longer than two quarters to digest.""

Patel isn't the only one. In a recent TrendForce report analysts predicted foundry revenues would contract 4 percent in 2023 as wafer demand continues to dry up and inventory consumption slows.

When the semiconductor market does recover the next question will be how quickly. Short of another civilization-altering event it seems we're unlikely to see the kind of pandemic-level investment in IT that fueled so much of the semiconductor demand over the past three years.

Why all the fabs then?

Given the perilous state the semiconductor space appears to be in it may surprise many to see chipmakers like Samsung TSMC and Intel pushing ahead on fab projects.

These facilities aren't cheap by any stretch of the imagination — prices are often measured in the tens of billions of dollars just to build even one fab. So you'd think these would have been the first on the chopping block. If nobody is buying chips why are you building more fabs? But that's exactly what they're doing.

Intel may be trying to get more cash out of the German government but they are — for the moment anyway — still committed to building a new fab there. And despite the poor quarter Samsung said it's pushing ahead with its foundry expansions including its new operation in Texas. SK Hynix has committed to building a US packaging facility. TSMC has scaled back its capex plans for the 2023 fiscal year but it still plans to spend between $32 billion and $36 billion on new infrastructure. If you're wondering that's between $4 billion and $8 billion less than in 2022.

While it might sound like poor business sense it's important to remember just how large and complex these facilities are. They're not just buildings. They're filled with sophisticated highly-regulated equipment that takes time to acquire install and validate. Most of the 20-or-so fabs announced to date won't come online before 2025.

It certainly doesn't hurt that the US and Europe are funneling tens of billions into domestic chip production in a bid to reduce their reliance on the Asia Pacific fabs before tensions with China boil over. ®",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hbmFseXplLmNvbS8yMDIzLzAyL25leHQtZ3JlYXQtc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1zdG9jay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Finding the Next Great Semiconductor Stock,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiQGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hbmFseXplLmNvbS8yMDIzLzAyL25leHQtZ3JlYXQtc2VtaWNvbmR1Y3Rvci1zdG9jay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002562F4268F0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Brookfield a major infrastructure investor put up $2 billion in equity and borrowed $13 billion from a mix of foreign banks pension funds and sovereign wealth funds ­according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the details weren’t public. That model isn’t new to infrastructure assets just to semiconductors says Scott Peak Brookfield Infrastructure’s chief investment officer for North America.

For Intel bringing in a deep-pocketed investor to cover 49% of the plant’s cost helps to support finances stretched by an ­unprecedented expansion plan a tough competitive landscape and a steep industrywide downturn. (In late January the chipmaker gave one of its gloomiest forecasts ever sending shares tumbling.) When the deal was announced in August Intel described Brookfield’s rate of return as “somewhere between its cost of debt and equity” which it pegged between about 4% and 8.5%. Intel declined to provide more details.

How the investment plays out will demonstrate whether private equity firms and their growing infrastructure funds can be part of the plan to reassert US competitiveness in chip manufacturing. Governments in North America and Europe are trying to rebuild that strategic capability and reduce their reliance on plants in East Asia. Brookfield’s Peak estimates that $1 trillion of capital is required for what Brookfield considers “large-scale critical manu­facturing” in areas such as semiconductors aerospace auto and gigafactories data management and telecommunications.

“There are a lot of infrastructure categories that are well-­established that were not on an investor’s radar 5 or 10 years ago—think data centers towers and fiber” Peak says. “New asset classes evolve and with them come new models and contractual arrangements that attract the right investor base.”

The growing need for semiconductors and the high valuations of companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. have attracted interest from investors. Firms including KKR & Co. and Blackstone Inc. have raised war chests to invest in the space as the definition of infrastructure stretches beyond toll roads and ports to data centers cellphone towers and fiber networks. In December AT&T Corp. and a unit of BlackRock Inc. announced plans to form a joint venture that will provide internet service to US customers outside AT&T’s traditional 21-state local phone territory.

Intel which named the new funding model SCIP (sounds like “skip”) for semiconductor co-investment program is already being contacted by investors with access to pools of private capital looking to form partnerships on other fabrication plants known as fabs in Ohio and Germany according to people familiar with the matter. Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger said in January that the company expects to create a second SCIP this year.

“Given the multiyear horizon of our investments in capacity and product road map we are focused on creating multiple pools of capital to support our strategic investments and enhance our flexibility which is particularly important during short-term periods of business disruption” says Dave Zinsner Intel’s chief financial officer. SCIPs “provide the added benefit of better aligning our capital requirements with our cash-flow-generation timelines as new fabs typically require more than two years of investment before coming online and generating revenue.”

Building plants and making chips require expensive state-of-the art technology that can become obsolete in as little as five years. That makes it riskier than the projects infrastructure investors are accustomed to which remain in use for decades. So unlike a traditional joint venture in which profits and losses are shared according to each partner’s investment in this deal Intel provided Brookfield with some protection against losses. On the flip side if the plant proves more profitable most of the benefits will accrue to the chipmaker.

In the eyes of rating companies that downside protection negates one benefit of the deal: that Intel can keep about half of the cost off its balance sheet and preserve its credit rating. Instead the rating companies view Intel’s guarantee to Brookfield as debtlike. That may affect companies’ willingness to embrace similar deals says Jason Pompeii an analyst for Fitch Ratings. Financing multiple projects in the same way could weigh on Intel’s credit rating.

Intel could tweak the structure of future partnerships to make the deals less debtlike and it’s getting help from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. people familiar with the matter say. The company should also benefit from subsidies and other incentives in the US Chips and Science Act which is designed to boost domestic production of semi­conductors.

For Intel’s Gelsinger the Brookfield deal helps fund one of the first steps in his plan to remake the company and reclaim leadership in the $580 billion industry it once dominated. He’s introducing new technology at a faster rate than ever to make Intel’s plants the world’s best. The company is also building factories across the US and Europe to produce its products as well as to manufacture for other companies even rivals.

The rate on the Brookfield financing now looks attractive as inflation has sent the cost of borrowing up steeply. But in the high-stakes game of semiconductor manufacturing success will depend on whether Intel can keep those factories producing high-priced electronic components at maximum capacity. As one of the world’s few remaining large-scale manufacturers of semi­conductors it has an advantage. Work at existing plants in Arizona Oregon Ireland and Israel could be shifted to the new factories to make sure they’re performing at levels that will ensure the deal’s terms don’t become burdensome.

Deals beyond semiconductors could follow says John Buchanan a Lazard Ltd. banker who advised Intel. “It’s a chance for companies with big physical assets to raise money at an attractive relative rate” he says.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS90ZWNoL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZm94Y29ubi12ZWRhbnRhLWV5ZS1zdG0tYXMtdGVjaC1wYXJ0bmVyL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk3NTg3MDA5LmNtc9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS90ZWNoL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZm94Y29ubi12ZWRhbnRhLWV5ZS1zdG0tYXMtdGVjaC1wYXJ0bmVyL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NzU4NzAwOS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Foxconn Vedanta plan tech tie-up with STM for India semiconductor manufacturing unit,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS90ZWNoL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZm94Y29ubi12ZWRhbnRhLWV5ZS1zdG0tYXMtdGVjaC1wYXJ0bmVyL2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk3NTg3MDA5LmNtc9IBcGh0dHBzOi8vbS5lY29ub21pY3RpbWVzLmNvbS90ZWNoL3RlY2hub2xvZ3kvZm94Y29ubi12ZWRhbnRhLWV5ZS1zdG0tYXMtdGVjaC1wYXJ0bmVyL2FtcF9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NzU4NzAwOS5jbXM?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002562F426B90>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

David Miller the pro-Palestinian British Sociologist who was sacked over Israel comments from Bristol University said that Israel has always been trying to penetrate British society discussing the modus operandi of Oracle the world's largest database company During Press TV’s weekly show Palestine Declassified.

In 1977 Oracle was founded by Larry Ellison. Today Oracle is the world's second-biggest IT software company and Ellison is the seventh-richest person in the world. He is still the top shareholder in Oracle and works as the Chief Technology Officer as well as sitting as the executive chairman of the company despite passing the role of CEO to Israeli Safra Catz.

Less well known is the closeness of Ellison and in fact the whole company to Israel. In 2007 Ellison gave half a million dollars directly to the illegal Israeli settlement of Sderot.

Over a period of a decade he donated over $26 million to the Israeli military through the funding vehicle the Friends of the Israeli Occupation Forces.

The extent of the company's relationship with Israel is even more clearly seen in the report that Ellison even offered the current Israeli prime minister the fascist Benjamin Netanyahu the position of director at Oracle.

“[Before] I had no idea that there were these kinds of conflicts of interest right at the top of British society” Miller said citing the company’s CEO explicitly saying it is pro-Israel and those disagreeing with its commitment to the Zionist regime are not welcomed in Oracle.

In July 2021 Oracle current CEO Safra Catz said upon her visit to Tel Aviv that voiced the Corporation’s deep commitment to Israel.

“… We are not flexible regarding our mission and our commitment to Israel is second to none. … [If our employees] don't agree with our mission to support the Israel then maybe we aren't the right company for them. Larry (Ellison co-founder of Oracle) and I are publicly committed to Israel and devote personal time to the country and no one should be surprised by that” Cats said.

Miller also slammed the British intelligence agency MI6 as “incompetent” wondering where the spy agency’s loyalties lie.

“What on earth MI6 is doing? Are they incompetent? Or have they actually used an agent to fall through this process and are involved in it in some way? It really does beg a belief that an organization like MI6 which is supposed to defend British national interests can be either blindsided by this or collaborating in something which clearly is a problematic thing for British national interests” Miller said.

“And we still have Israel trying to penetrate British society. This is one example we'd be looking at the Ministry of Defense. There are many many others and it's the right time for the British security establishment to wake up and smell the coffee. This is something which they need to focus on” he concluded.

In an earlier edition of weekly show Palestine Declassified aired in mid-December Miller explained that the integration of the UK-Israeli tech industry is a means for the Zionist “operatives” to infiltrate into the “very fabric” of the British governance clarifying the UK-Israel Tech Hub’s true mission.

He also voiced concerns over Israeli tech hubs' infiltration into the British National Health Service (NHS) and getting access to citizens’ data.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS90ZWNoL29yYWNsZS1pbnZlc3QtMS01LWJpbGxpb24tMDcwNTIwNTcyLmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Oracle to invest $1.5 billion in Saudi Arabia open data centre in Riyadh,"By Supantha Mukherjee and Aziz El Yaakoubi

(Reuters) - Oracle Corp plans to invest $1.5 billion in Saudi Arabia in the coming years as it builds up its cloud footprint in the kingdom and opens its third public cloud region in Riyadh a company official said.

Increased demand for cloud computing has pushed technology companies such as Oracle Microsoft Amazon and Alphabet's Google to set up data centres across the world to speed up data transfer.

Saudi officials have pressed international companies to invest in the kingdom and move their regional headquarters to Riyadh in order to benefit from government contracts. ""We are finalising the plans for opening the Riyadh region. We are still working with our suppliers before we can announce the actual date"" Nick Redshaw a senior vice president at Oracle said in an interview from Dubai.

Redshaw said the investment will be made over several years without providing detail. He added that Oracle would also expand the capacity of its cloud region in Jeddah which the company first opened in 2020.

The company made the announcement as global tech companies gathered for a major tech conference in the Saudi capital. Though Oracle lags its bigger rivals in the race to corner the cloud computing market it was among the first large tech companies to open a data centre in Saudi Arabia.

The kingdom has been devoted hundreds of billions of dollars to an economic transformation known as Vision 2030 led by its de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

But it has struggled to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) one of the pillars of Vision 2030 which aims at diversifying the economy away from oil.

FDI reached just under $4.1 billion in the first half of 2022 a fraction of the ambitious $100 billion target set for the end of this decade. While Oracle has been working with the government Saudi Arabia has been trying to encourage foreign firms to set up headquarters in the country or risk losing out on government contracts and has given them until the end of 2023 to comply. ""We are working closely with the Saudi government to finalise plans for that regional headquarter requirement and we will announce them as we finalise that with them"" Redshaw said. Oracle has also won contracts from the crown prince's $500 billion flagship NEOM project a futuristic mega city and economic zone which the crown prince is building on the Red Sea coast. NEOM is one of our largest consumers of cloud capability in Saudi Arabia Redshaw said.

In reality it's still a good opportunity to establish positions in safe companies to purchase for the long term while fear uncertainty and doubt continue to roil the markets.

Although buying risk-free stocks sounds like a great idea there isn't a stock that is really secure. Even the most stable organizations frequently endure considerable stock price fluctuation and even the finest companies might encounter unforeseen difficulties. This was evident in the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic when the stock prices of numerous powerful firms fell sharply. One way to deal with individual stock risk is diversification.

Over the last 12 months U.S. stocks declined slightly more than 10%. We had a great start to 2023 but the markets seem to be overly optimistic. Long-term interest rates are around 3.5% and consensus estimates for S&P 500 Index hover around $230. This means the market has a forward PE ratio of 18 assuming that the optimistic consensus earnings estimates are accurate.

Long-term investors however don't pay attention to the volatile short-term rise and fall of stock markets. Instead they invest in shares of dependable businesses with consistent performance over years or even decades. The best long-term investments are equities of expanding companies that offer consistent profits. You must comprehend the measurements that provide reliable proof of trustworthy long-term success to locate them.

The U.S. dollar index peaked in early November 2022 and has since fallen like a rock. Historically when investors believe that the dollar will remain weak they will bid up the stock price of technology stocks which appears to be the case starting this new year.

So far the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund which tracks an index of S&P 500 technology stocks has risen around 15% in 2023. And with a rising tide lifting all boats Palo Alto Networks' (PANW 1.33%) shares have risen 17%. However you should refrain from investing based solely on what happens in foreign exchange markets.

Let's consider some other excellent reasons why Palo Alto Networks should be high on your potential buy list in this uncertain economic environment.

It is still snowballing in a down market

Palo Alto Networks is a cybersecurity company -- an advantage in a terrible economic environment because while the global economy might be going into a recession cybercrime is in a bull market. Internet magazine Cybersecurity Ventures estimates global cybercrime costs will rise from $3 trillion in 2015 to $10.5 trillion annually by 2025 a compound annual growth rate of 13.4%.

Since few companies can afford many of the costs of intellectual property theft website spoofing ransomware identity theft Internet-of-Things hacking or malware cybersecurity has become an essential service. Consequently demand for Palo Alto's cybersecurity services remains high even amidst a pandemic high inflation rising interest rates a European war supply chain woes and general economic uncertainty.

The company generated 25% revenue growth to reach $1.56 billion in its fiscal 2023's first quarter which ended in September 2022. That's excellent for the largest IT security company by market capitalization. Additionally the company's next generation security (NGS) business grew its average recurring revenue (ARR) an astounding 67% year over year to $2 billion. ARR is a fundamental subscription business metric that can help predict future sales. Therefore a rapidly growing ARR augurs well for the future.

Even better for shareholders Palo Alto says it is growing at roughly twice its total addressable market rate because multiple changes in the security market are tailwinds for its business. One of the most significant changes is that customers no longer want to buy multiple disparate security functions from different vendors.

Instead many cybersecurity customers today prefer a vendor that offers a platform of interoperable solutions. So for example the days of buying a firewall from one company antivirus software from another company and intrusion prevention software from another are over.

The recent economic downturn accelerates this consolidation trend. Many companies wanting to conserve capital are consolidating more security functions to fewer vendors in order to cut costs. And Palo Alto gets a lot of that consolidation business because of the high quality of its products.

Today the company is a leader across seven significant security categories and information technology experts like Gartner Forrester Research Frost & Sullivan and others rate Palo Alto as having the best solutions.

The one fly in the ointment

Should you decide to invest in this company you will need to be comfortable with the fact that it is difficult to achieve profitability in the cybersecurity industry. Plus the potential of rapid technological changes can cause cybersecurity companies to quickly decline into obsolescence if they fail to keep up with change.

For example despite being in business since 2005 Palo Alto found that its original products providing advanced firewalls and intrusion prevention systems remained stubbornly unprofitable. Then before the company became profitable technological advancements like cloud computing upended its original business model delaying profitability further and forcing it to change in 2018 to stay competitive.

You can see on the above chart that Palo Alto's net income has rarely ventured into profitability for most of its history. However things are changing.

Growing profits and free cash flow

Palo Alto has finally reached a point in its evolution where it can add revenue at a much greater rate than cost. As a result its first-quarter fiscal 2023 results produced a net income under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) of $20 million or $0.06 per diluted share its second straight quarter of profitability.

The company is also a free-cash-flow (FCF) machine producing $2.4 billion of FCF on a trailing-12-month basis at a robust 42% margin.

Investors love profitable companies with healthy cash flows in a slowing economy which should limit Palo Alto's downside. And with long-term solid growth tailwinds at its back it is little wonder savvy investors gravitate to this stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbGNhbGlzdGVjaC5jb20vY3RlY2huZXdzL2FydGljbGUvc2pyNmcxYTNq0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Digital bank One Zero raises another $62 million at $320 million valuation,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.calcalistech.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /ctechnews/article/sjr6g1a3j (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002562609C400>, 'Connection to www.calcalistech.com timed out.

Stocks of payment services like PayPal which owns Venmo and Block which owns Cash App boomed in 2020 as more people began sending money digitally.

Zelle which launched in 2017 stands out from the pack in a few ways. It's owned and operated by Early Warning Services LLC which is co-owned by seven of the big banks and it's not publicly traded. The platform serves the banks beyond generating an independent revenue stream.

""Zelle is not really a revenue-generating enterprise on a stand-alone basis"" said Mike Cashman a partner at Bain & Co. ""You should think of this really as a little bit of an accommodation but also as an engagement tool versus a revenue-generating machine.""

""If you're already transacting with your bank and you trust your bank then the fact that your bank offers Zelle as a means of payment is attractive to you"" said Terri Bradford a payment specialist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City.

One limitation of PayPal Venmo and Cash App is that users must all be using the same service. Zelle's appeal is that anyone with a bank account at a participating financial institution can send money.

""For banks it's a no-brainer to try to compete in that space"" said Jaime Toplin senior analyst at Insider Intelligence. ""Customers use their mobile-banking apps all the time and no one wants to cede the opportunity from a space that people are already really active in to third-party competitors.""

Clarification: Zelle appeals to users because anyone with a bank account at a participating financial institution can send money. An earlier version misstated the number of participants.

It is especially convenient at gas pumps where your phone is likely mounted to your dashboard or sitting in a cupholder.

One excellent option for digital payment is PayPal.

Google Pay and Samsung Pay both allow you to link your PayPal account to their digital wallets.

Unfortunately this is not yet true of Apple Pay.

20 Gas Stations That Accept PayPal

1. Chevron

Chevron began as the Pacific Coast Oil Company in 1879 in San Francisco.

They built refineries and drilled for oil for years before the first motor vehicles hit the road.

After a few name changes and expansions Chevron as we know it today was born.

Today there are around 7000 Chevron locations throughout the United States.

Chevron fuel boasts the addition of Techron which the company claims will maximize gas mileage while minimizing emissions.

You can pay using PayPal through Google Pay and Samsung Pay at Chevron.

Once your PayPal account is linked to your digital wallet you can pay with your phone at the pump.

2. Texaco

Texaco was started in 1902 under the name Texas Fuel Company.

For a long time Texaco was the only gas company selling gasoline under the same brand name in all 50 states.

This made it a truly national company.

In 2001 Chevron bought Texaco and took over its refineries.

Many of its stations were then divested to Shell.

However Texaco stations can still be found throughout the country.

There are roughly 1300 locations today.

Because it is owned by Chevron Texaco fuel also has Techron in it.

To pay with PayPal at Texaco download the Texaco app and input your PayPal information.

You can then pay through the app when at the pump.

You can even pay while sitting in your car.

3. Shell

The Shell Company began in London when Marcus Samuel began importing seashells from the Far East to sell in his store.

He passed the company on to his sons who expanded the company and began importing and exporting oil.

The company was later named Shell as a tribute to their father and his business’s humble beginnings.

After 185 years Shell is a global company with over 14000 stations across the United States.

With the Shell app you can use PayPal to purchase fuel as well as items from inside the store.

4. Phillips 66

Phillips 66 opened its first gas station in 1927 in Oklahoma.

The name came from the name of the refinery owners—Frank and L.E. Phillips—and the road test of a new fuel when the test car reached 66 mph on Route 66.

During World War II the company produced aviation fuel for Allied airplanes.

The company merged with Conoco in 2002 to form ConocoPhillips.

After a split in 2012 the company returned to the name Phillips 66 though it is still linked to Conoco.

There are around 7500 Phillips 66 gas stations across 48 states with the company’s headquarters residing in Texas.

Phillips 66 only accepts PayPal through Samsung Pay at participating locations.

5. Exxon Mobil

In 1859 the first successful oil well was drilled in Titusville Pennsylvania.

This led to the formation of the Standard Oil Company which dominated the oil industry for many years by taking over other oil companies.

After a landmark Supreme Court case was decided against Standard Oil in 1911 the company split into 34 different oil companies which evolved into many of the gas stations on this list.

Exxon Mobil emerged from Standard Oil of New Jersey.

Today there are more than 11000 Exxon and Mobil gas stations in the United States.

Exxon Mobil uses Synergy gasoline which they claim protects your engine from damage and gives your car better performance.

The Exxon Mobil Rewards app accepts PayPal through digital wallets like Google Pay and Samsung Pay.

Once you link your PayPal account to your digital wallet you can use it in the Exxon Mobil app.

6. ARCO

Compared to other gasoline companies on this list ARCO is a relatively new one.

Founded in 1966 under the name Atlantic Richfield Company ARCO decided in the early ‘80s to go cash-only.

In 1986 after several rough years they began to accept ATM (debit) cards with a 10-cent transaction fee—something that many stations still charge today.

ARCO was acquired by BP in the year 2000.

It was then sold to Tesoro in 2012.

They’ve recently begun to accept credit cards and digital payments.

Today there are around 1300 ARCO gas stations throughout the western United States and northwestern Mexico.

ARCO accepts PayPal when linked to Google Pay and Samsung Pay.

Simply input your PayPal information and then pay with your digital wallet at the pump.

7. BP

After seven frustrating years of drilling for oil in Persia William D’Arcy’s First Exploitation Company struck paydirt in 1908.

They then became the Anglo-Persian Oil Company housed in England.

Anglo-Persian purchased the assets of British Petroleum (BP) in 1917.

When Britain entered World War II BP supported the war effort by providing aviation fuel and engineering a gasoline pipeline that followed Allied ships to Normandy.

Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries the company saw tragedies such as the Texas City Refinery explosion and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

Despite it all the company still exists today with some 7200 gas stations throughout the country.

BP pumps accept PayPal through Google Pay or you can link PayPal to the BPme app.

8. Sunoco

Sunoco opened its first gas station in Pennsylvania in 1920.

Following World War II they expanded into Canada and Venezuela.

In 1956 Sunoco introduced “custom blending” which allows you to choose from several octane ratings at the same pump.

After exiting the refinery business and filing for bankruptcy Sunoco was purchased and its headquarters were moved to Dallas Texas.

The company has been the official fuel of NASCAR since 2004.

There are more than 5200 Sunoco gas stations in the United States today.

Sunoco accepts Samsung Pay or payment right through the PayPal app at the pump.

At participating locations you can also pay with PayPal for goods inside the store.

9. CITGO

The Cities Services Company eventually CITGO was one of the first companies to provide gas and electricity to public utilities in the United States.

In the 1970s the CITGO Quik Mart pioneered the idea of convenience stores being connected with gas stations.

In Boston the CITGO sign is an iconic sight in Kenmore Square and a major landmark along the course of the Boston Marathon.

There are over 4600 CITGO gas stations across 31 states.

There aren’t any CITGOs in the West or Southwest.

The westernmost CITGO station is in central Texas.

However throughout the East South and Midwest they are easy to find.

CITGO stations accept PayPal on a franchise-by-franchise basis.

Those that do accept PayPal take it through Samsung Pay.

10. Cumberland Farms

Cumberland Farms differs from most other gas stations on this list in that its origins are not in petroleum but in dairy.

In 1939 a couple in Rhode Island purchased a cow and began a small dairy farm.

Cumberland Farms quickly became a series of dairy stores throughout New England which eventually turned into convenience stores.

When cars became more common in the states self-serve gas pumps began appearing outside the stores.

Nearly 600 Cumberland Farms convenience stores are in operation in the United States today.

The pumps at Cumberland Farms accept their SmartPay Rewards app which works with PayPal.

In-store you can use the app or Samsung Pay to pay with PayPal.

11. Speedway

Speedway was founded in 1952 in Michigan.

In 1962 the first incarnation of Speedway became defunct when it was converted to the Marathon brand.

In 1976 however Marathon chose to use the Speedway name once again in self-service stations with convenience stores.

The brand was eventually acquired by 7-Eleven but the Speedway name continues to be used.

There are around 4000 locations in the United States mostly in the East and Midwest though there are some along the West Coast.

Speedway does not accept PayPal at the pump but you can pay with PayPal through Samsung Pay in the convenience stores.

12. Kwik Trip/Kwik Star

Kwik Trip convenience stores first opened in 1965 in Eau Claire Wisconsin.

By 1983 the company had expanded into 50 stores.

Three years after that they had 100 locations.

In addition to traditional convenience store offerings the stores feature bakery and grocery sections.

They also have a small deli that will cook food to order.

Kwik Trip also operates its own dairy which supplies milk cheese and ice cream.

The stores that are located just off highways operate as full-service truck stops.

The Kwik Trip name exists only in Wisconsin and Minnesota while in Iowa and Illinois they are known as Kwik Star stores.

Throughout the four states more than 750 locations are in operation.

Only some locations accept PayPal but those that do will take it both at the pump and in-store through Samsung Pay.

13. Meijer

This chain of gas stations and convenience stores began as the grocery store chain of the same name.

The first Meijer gas station was opened in 1967.

Twenty years later the company opened its first convenience store.

Their gas stations and c-stores operate in the same location as their supercenter stores though not every supercenter has a gas station.

There are 176 Meijer gas stations throughout Illinois Indiana Kentucky Michigan and Ohio.

The stations offer gasoline diesel propane and alternative fuels.

Meijer convenience stores accept PayPal through Samsung Pay.

14. Delta Sonic

Delta Sonic is primarily a car wash though their locations feature gas stations and convenience stores as well.

The car wash chain was founded in 1967.

Their gas pumps offer a variety of fuels and fuel grades.

Customers can get a discount on gas by purchasing a car wash.

The chain operates 29 locations throughout New York Illinois and Pennsylvania.

Unfortunately Delta Sonic does not accept PayPal at the pump but their stores will take PayPal through Samsung Pay.

15. Valero

Valero Energy Corporation was born in 1980 and opened its first full-scale refinery in Corpus Christi four years later.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s the company made major purchases and mergers with other oil companies making it the largest refining company in North America.

Later the company acquired several ethanol plants and built 33 wind turbines creating an alternative energy subsidiary.

Today Valero operates 15 refineries throughout the country which supply fuel to more than 7000 gas stations mainly throughout the East and Midwest.

Depending on the franchise owner some Valero locations accept PayPal in-store.

When at a participating location you can pay with PayPal through Samsung Pay at the register.

16. Kwik Fill

Not to be confused with Kwik Trip and Kwik Star Kwik Fill gas stations operate in New York State Pennsylvania and Ohio.

The gas stations are associated with Red Apple Food Mart convenience stores.

Some Kwik Fills are standalone gas stations with no convenience store while others are located with Red Apple stores of varying sizes.

Their nearly 300 locations include four full-size truck stops four mini truck stops and two truck stop motels.

Red Apple Food Marts accept PayPal through Samsung Pay in-store.

17. QuikTrip

The last on a list of similar-sounding names QuikTrip first opened in 1958 in Tulsa Oklahoma.

Initially the company was just a convenience store but they added gas pumps in 1971.

In the 1980s the company opened “travel centers” which featured 5000-square-foot stores 12 gas pumps five diesel pumps and a truck scale.

QuikTrip earned a “Top Tier” rating in 2005 indicating that their gasoline exceeds the EPA’s standards for gasoline additives.

In the ‘90s QuikTrip opened Wendy’s and Burger King fast-food stores in some of their c-stores.

Today QuikTrip operates more than 900 stores in 14 stores.

Their convenience stores accept PayPal through Samsung Pay.

18. Sheetz

Like Cumberland Farms Sheetz convenience stores started as dairies.

In the ‘50s brothers Steve and Bob Sheetz turned their father’s dairy stores into convenience stores.

From 1952 to 1972 the company expanded to 14 locations.

The following year they introduced gas pumps.

By 1983 Sheetz had grown to 100 stores.

As the company grew the stores introduced their own line of coffee and bakery products.

The chain is still family-owned and based in its original city of Altoona Pennsylvania.

There are more than 600 locations across six states on the eastern side of the country.

Sheetz takes PayPal through Samsung Pay at all locations both at the pump and in-store.

19. RaceTrac

RaceTrac began as Carl Bolch Trackside Stations in 1934.

When Carl Bolch purchased Oil Well Company they began expanding through multiple states in the south.

In the ‘70s the company introduced the first self-serve gas stations in Alabama and Georgia.

In 1979 they adopted the name RaceTrac.

They then began Metroplex Energy a subsidiary of RaceTrac that provides bulk fuel to their gas stations.

In 2004 the company introduced fresh food to their convenience stores.

Throughout the early 2010s RaceTrac began expanding its convenience store models adding frozen yogurt machines indoor and outdoor seating and free Wi-Fi.

More than 550 locations operate throughout Florida Georgia Mississippi Louisiana Tennessee and Texas.

PayPal is accepted through Samsung Pay in almost all convenience store locations.

20. 76

In 1932 Union Oil introduced 76 gasoline.

The name was in reference to the US Declaration of Independence being signed in 1776 as well as the octane rating of gasoline at the time.

They are known for their sign which is an orange ball with “76” written on it in blue.

In 2001 the company was purchased by Phillips and became part of the ConocoPhillips company.

The company split in 2012 and now 76 is owned solely by Phillips 66.

There are just over 2000 locations throughout the country mainly in the South and on the West Coast.

The company is a partner with Google Pay so to pay with PayPal you’ll need to link your PayPal account to your digital wallet.

Linking PayPal To Digital Wallets

It’s not currently possible to link PayPal to your digital wallet on iOS devices.

However Samsung Pay and Google Pay have made it possible for Android users.

To be able to pay with PayPal at these gas stations and many other businesses you’ll need to add your PayPal information to the wallet first.

This is a simple process.

1. Google Pay

To add PayPal to Google Pay open the Google Pay app.

Tap the card button at the top of the screen.

Tap “Add a Payment Method.”

Then click “add PayPal.”

Input your information including the email address associated with your PayPal account.

Accept the terms and conditions and you’re all set.

There are two ways to make PayPal your default payment method in Google Pay.

First you can simply long-press the PayPal card and move it to the top of the list of cards.

The other way is to tap the PayPal card and select “Set as default” in the card details screen.

Linking these accounts will allow the two apps to share some data.

The two will share your name billing address email address account type and a few other pieces of information.

2. Samsung Pay

Linking PayPal to Samsung Pay is very similar.

Open the Samsung Pay app and tap “Add PayPal.”

Log into your PayPal account then select a top-up amount.

Top Up is a PayPal feature that allows the app to pull money in increments of $10 from your bank account.

This helps prevent your payment from being declined when you don’t have sufficient funds in your PayPal account at the time of purchase.

The app will also ask you to select a backup funding instrument for your top-up (such as a bank account).

You can add up to five PayPal accounts to your Samsung Pay wallet.

To make PayPal your default payment method through Samsung Pay select the checkbox “add to favorite cards” when linking your account.

Paying With The PayPal App

For those without an Android phone paying through the PayPal app is still an option.

Unfortunately fewer businesses accept the PayPal app than digital wallets but there are a handful that will receive payments in this way.

The PayPal app utilizes QR codes to help you pay for items in-store.

There are two ways to make a purchase at a participating business.

The first way is to use the PayPal app to scan the QR code on the item in question.

However not all businesses have items with QR codes.

The other way to pay is to present your PayPal QR code at the register (found under “show to pay”).

Participating businesses will be able to scan your QR code and the money will come out of your PayPal account.

PepsiCo and Anheuser-Busch InBev — previously two major Super Bowl sponsors — have reportedly struck advertising deals with Twitter for the Big Game which is historically the social media platform’s highest-grossing advertising event of the year.

PepsiCo has committed to spending more than $3 million on Twitter takeover ads on Feb. 12 the day of the Super Bowl according to The Information.

on on Feb. 12 the day of the Super Bowl according to The Information. Anheuser-Busch InBev has reportedly committed to spending $2.4 million on takeover ads including at least four in the weeks before the Super Bowl.

Both companies have extra money to allocate.

PepsiCo will not be the Super Bowl halftime show’s title sponsor for the first time since it struck a deal in 2012 reportedly worth more than $2 billion. Its spot was filled by Apple.

Anheuser-Busch InBev will not be the exclusive alcohol advertiser for the game for the first time since 1989.

The deals come after mass layoffs and fleeing advertisers following Musk’s arrival.

Waning Wallets

Researchers led by Dr. Dena Abd El Aziz El Sammak of Zagazig University Hospital in Zagazig noted that the uptake occurs more often in patients who have been on treatment for more than six months prior to the second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

""Knowing mRNA vaccination-related secondary effects is essential for radiologists and oncologists to prevent false interpretations during diagnostic imaging procedures"" the team wrote. The study was published online February 2 in the Egyptian Journal of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine.

Since September 30 2021 approximately 8.25 million people in Egypt have received one or more doses of Pfizer vaccine according to the authors.

Previous research has shown that enlarged and sometimes painful swollen lymph nodes can occur in cancer patients within days following COVID-19 vaccinations. These cases of vaccine-associated hypermetabolic lymphadenopathy (VAHL) can confound PET/CT findings related to a patient's malignant lymphadenopathy primarily due to the ability of F-18 FDG-PET/CT scans in detecting ""hot"" nodes even if they are normal.

In this study the authors sought to explore the issue further by investigating the incidence of VAHL in patients undergoing rituximab treatment for lymphoma who received second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

The researchers reviewed scans of 120 patients at their hospital in Zagazig who underwent PET/CT imaging between October 2021 to April 2022. They included adult lymphoma patients who had scans within one to three weeks after their second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. All patients had been on treatment for at least six months.

According to the findings hypermetabolic lymph nodes were identified ipsilateral to the vaccine injection site in 66 of 120 vaccinated patients (55%). The authors noted that the incidence and grades of VAHL were higher within the first week following the second vaccine dose than the second and third weeks and that patients younger than 60 years old showed higher incidence and grades of VAHL than those older than 60.

Ultimately accurate data collection regarding the time and site of COVID-19 vaccinations are important to help radiologists in identifying the cause of abnormal lymph node FDG uptake the authors wrote. As in previous studies they recommended scheduling F-18 FDG-PET/CT imaging for lymphoma patients at least three weeks after their second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. This step can help avoid additional patient anxiety and potentially unnecessary biopsies they added.

""Radiologists' awareness of VAHL is important to prevent FDG PET/CT misinterpretation"" the authors concluded.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL2hlYWx0aC8yMDIzLzAyLzA0L2NvdmlkLXRyZWF0bWVudC1wYXhsb3ZpZC1waWxsLWV4cGxhaW5lZC8xMTA4NDIzMjAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Paxlovid for COVID: Side effects drug interactions what to know,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnVzYXRvZGF5LmNvbS9zdG9yeS9uZXdzL2hlYWx0aC8yMDIzLzAyLzA0L2NvdmlkLXRyZWF0bWVudC1wYXhsb3ZpZC1waWxsLWV4cGxhaW5lZC8xMTA4NDIzMjAwMi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000256263CEA70>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Faced with the possibility of going into the luxury tax next season the New Orleans Pelicans could going into the offseason trying to cut payroll with several trade candidates on their roster.

Michael Scotto said on the latest episode of the HoopsHype podcast that CJ McCollum is ""not untouchable"" in trade talks but he's considered a ""grown-up in the room for a young Pelicans squad providing stability on the court and a good locker room presence for the team.""

The Pelicans currently have $167.4 million in salary on their books for next season. That total doesn't include cap holds that bring their total up to $199.7 million which is nearly $10 million over the projected second tax apron.

Jonas Valančiūnas who has a $23.2 million cap hold is the biggest question mark for the Pelicans among their potential free agents.

ESPN's Bobby Marks noted the Pelicans have never paid the luxury tax in franchise history and the front office's decision regarding Valančiūnas and Naji Marshall who is also a free agent will determine if the club has the full nontaxpayer mid-level exception of $12.9 million or the taxpayer mid-level of $5.1 million available.

Of the potential trade candidates for the Pelicans Brandon Ingram has been the most-talked about thus far. The 26-year-old will be playing on a $36 million expiring contract next season but his deal includes a 15 percent trade kicker that could complicate any potential deal.

ESPN's Brian Windhorst has cited the Philadelphia 76ers as a potential landing spot for Ingram this summer. Scotto noted rival executives consider him to be the ""most likely"" Pelicans player to be moved because the fit on the court ""isn't ideal"" with Zion Williamson.

Next season will mark the first year of McCollum's two-year $64 million deal he signed in September 2022. The contract has descending salaries of $33.3 million in 2024-25 and $30.7 million in 2025-26 that could make it easier to trade.

The Pelicans have invested a lot of money in this core that hasn't produced great results. They have made the playoffs in two of the past three years but lost in the first round both times. They were swept by the Oklahoma City Thunder this year with Williamson unavailable due to a hamstring injury he suffered in the play-in tournament loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi2AFodHRwczovL25ld3MucGcuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvbmV3cy1kZXRhaWxzLzIwMjQvUHJvY3Rlci0tR2FtYmxlLVJlY2FsbHMtOC4yLU1pbGxpb24tRGVmZWN0aXZlLUJhZ3Mtb2YtVGlkZS1HYWluLUFjZS1hbmQtQXJpZWwtTGF1bmRyeS1EZXRlcmdlbnQtUGFja2V0cy1EaXN0cmlidXRlZC1pbi1VUy1EdWUtdG8tUmlzay1vZi1TZXJpb3VzLUluanVyeS9kZWZhdWx0LmFzcHjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Procter & Gamble Recalls 8.2 Million Defective Bags of Tide Gain Ace and Ariel Laundry Detergent Packets ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.pg.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news-releases/news-details/2024/Procter--Gamble-Recalls-8.2-Million-Defective-Bags-of-Tide-Gain-Ace-and-Ariel-Laundry-Detergent-Packets-Distributed-in-US-Due-to-Risk-of-Serious-Injury/default.aspx (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000256267CC4F0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi2AFodHRwczovL25ld3MucGcuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvbmV3cy1kZXRhaWxzLzIwMjQvUHJvY3Rlci0tR2FtYmxlLVJlY2FsbHMtOC4yLU1pbGxpb24tRGVmZWN0aXZlLUJhZ3Mtb2YtVGlkZS1HYWluLUFjZS1hbmQtQXJpZWwtTGF1bmRyeS1EZXRlcmdlbnQtUGFja2V0cy1EaXN0cmlidXRlZC1pbi1VUy1EdWUtdG8tUmlzay1vZi1TZXJpb3VzLUluanVyeS9kZWZhdWx0LmFzcHjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTkvcHJvY3Rlci1nYW1ibGUtcGctcTMtMjAyNC1lYXJuaW5ncy5odG1s0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjQvMDQvMTkvcHJvY3Rlci1nYW1ibGUtcGctcTMtMjAyNC1lYXJuaW5ncy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Procter & Gamble sales disappoint as price hikes slow down,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMTkvcHJvY3Rlci1nYW1ibGUtcGctcTMtMjAyNC1lYXJuaW5ncy5odG1s0gFLaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY25iYy5jb20vYW1wLzIwMjQvMDQvMTkvcHJvY3Rlci1nYW1ibGUtcGctcTMtMjAyNC1lYXJuaW5ncy5odG1s?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000256267CD150>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Gray has worked with legal firms for over two decades in advocating for low-income communities in Chicago that disproportionately bear the brunt of environmental injustice - such as the selenium generated by the nearby plant on the Indiana border.

""Just because a contaminant is at a low level doesn't mean it has no effect. That's a very empty excuse"" Gray said also noting that Lake Michigan's chemistry has already been altered significantly by pollutants.

The toothlessness of local authorities in dealing with water pollution as well as the IEPA's unwillingness to pursue enforcement actions is part of a larger trend of industrial deregulation that has steadily advanced in the US since the far-right Reagan administration. Most environmental standards for oil refineries have not been revised since 1985 despite an explicit goal of the 1972 Clean Water Act being ""the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters be eliminated by 1985.""

""EPA’s national discharge limits for refineries apply to just ten pollutants including ammonia chromium and oil and grease. These skeletal standards do not begin to address the variety and volume of dangerous contaminants found in the wastewater from refining processes"" the January report concludes.

The report also lambasts the EPA for failing to revise the 1985 standards in 2021 when the agency published its 15th Preliminary Effluent Guidelines Program Plan. The plan ""announce[d] no further action on oil and gas extraction wastewater management.""

The EIP report said this decision was ""based on a cursory erroneous and plainly inadequate analysis of the industry.""

""I cannot tell you my level of disgust"" Gray said in agreement. ""The EPA is supposed to be the champion of people who need protection and they're not.""

Professor Jean-François Gaillard Gray's colleague in the civil and environmental engineering school at Northwestern also expressed exasperation at the lack of state control over these high-polluting private companies. The French-born professor said that the offending Illinois oil refineries would likely not be able to get away with discharging as much pollution were they operating in the European Union.

""In Europe... they have to show that what they discharge into the environment does not harm aquatic life"" Gaillard said. ""The US has never really set this regulation in place.""

Gaillard further detailed an EU regulatory structure known as REACH which stands for Registration Evaluation Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals. Under REACH the European Chemical Agency can restrict the use and sale of hazardous substances if their producer cannot identify and manage their risks.

""The regulations in Europe are much more restrictive... if there are violations it makes it so you cannot buy products from this manufacturer"" Gaillard said. ""Most of the discussions about metal [in the US] is not going in the same direction as Europe.""

The US' lack of regulations on the private sector goes even beyond the energy industry with standards for food and pharmaceutical production being far more lax than most of the developed world.

As Germinal Organic - a company that produces foods for both the U.S. and European markets - put it ""in the United States food additives are innocent until proven guilty while in Europe only those additives proven not to be harmful are approved for use.""

What makes the lack of regulation on oil refineries so particularly worrying is that many of the metals discharged into Illinois waters are ""bio-accumulative"" according to Professor Kathryn Nagy Department Head of Environmental Biogeochemisty at the University of Illinois - Chicago. This means that not only are people drinking in pollutants from their tap water the dissolved metals are also absorbed in the different plants and animals people eat.

""Any organic matter that you can imagine the metals tend to attach to the organic matter"" Nagy said. ""If we have too much of them they start replacing metals that we need for our cellular processes.""

Excessive selenium for example can replace the sulfur in a person's amino acids disrupting normal cell function and potentially leading to disorders ranging from organ damage to various cancers.

Metal pollution from refineries is likely to continue for as long as gasoline remains a primary consumer fuel as according to Professor Nagy these metals are present naturally in crude oil and must be removed during the refining process. But Gray stressed that there are actually methods for oil refineries to reduce wastewater contamination. She again blamed a lack of effective regulation for those methods not seeing widespread implementation in the US saying oil companies would not voluntarily hurt their profit margins by investing in more intensive waste treatment.

""There are treatment methods for this but once [the pollutants] are released you can't treat them"" Gray said. ""If they're not using these treatment methods they're saving money.""

Per professor Gaillard and the EIP's January report the only thing preventing the worst water polluters from being reigned in is a lack of political will.

""It's just a question of legislation"" Gaillard said.

Gray though was skeptical that the political will to challenge Big Oil will coalesce anytime soon. In 2022 alone BP Citgo Phillips 66 and Exxon Mobil saw over $76 billion in profits between them while national figures in both major political parties have taken millions in oil and gas companies' political donations.

""[The Indiana plant] is constantly in violation of its permits"" Gray said. ""But because they're Big Oil the EPA don't enforce them.""

""I think it's absolutely criminal"" she added.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHA6Ly93d3cuZXNwbi5jb20vbWVucy1jb2xsZWdlLWJhc2tldGJhbGwvcGxheWVyL2dhbWVsb2cvXy9pZC81MTA1ODExL2Rhbi1za2lsbGluZ3MtanLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dan Skillings Jr. 2023-24 Stats per Game - NCAAM,"Daniel Skillings gets up for the beautiful slam

HALF-TIME: Combined Provinces XV 26-5 The Thistles

The hosts were able to apply pressure at the beginning of the second-half but The Thistles defence was firm and brought to a halt several attacks.

Crisafulli Economic Development Act. “The Lincoln casino has long been our flagship property and we are proud of our Rhode Island roots even as the company expands globally. We promised our partner the State of Rhode Island that we would continuously explore ways to increase the value of the property and generate increased revenue and clearly the opening of this 14000-square-foot high-end spa will serve to do both.”

All of these will work under the Mumbai Parking Authority (MAP) which is yet to get a legal status.The BMC has completed the parking management plan including survey and GIS mapping at all 24 wards to identify parking and no-parking zones. Chahal said they are ready to implement the pilot project in four administrative wards and have received all required permissions including traffic police NOC.In 2019 the BMC had made a provision for setting up the MPA an independent body to regulate on-street and off-street parking in the city through the Development Control and Promotion Regulation-2034. An amendment to the Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act to give legal status to MPA to empower it to fine offenders was proposed. It is awaiting final approval from the state government.The MPA has conducted surveys to understand off-street and on-street parking patterns in each area and has suggested alternatives including available public parking lots in the vicinity and parking on commercial premises.The BMC has also appointed contractors for the construction of shuttle and robo type parking under multi-level mechanized parking at near Matunga station and at Mumbadevi which will provide 475 and 546 car parking spaces respectively. The BMC is also in process of appointing contractors for underground parking at Patwardhan Park in Bandra (W) Byculla zoo and Municipal Engineering Hub at Worli.The revenue generated through parking will be used inter alia for parking infrastructure and improving public transport and pedestrian facilities civic officials said.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Procter & Gamble on Friday reported mixed quarterly results as it struggles to bring back shoppers after two years of hiking prices across its portfolio from Tide detergent to Charmin toilet paper.

The company's prices were up 3% compared with the year-ago period although CFO Andre Schulten said on a media call that P&G didn't institute any nationwide price hikes during the quarter.

Despite its disappointing sales the consumer giant raised its full-year outlook for earnings growth.

Shares of the company fell more than 1% in morning trading.

Here's what P&G reported compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $1.52 vs. $1.41 expected

Revenue: $20.2 billion vs. $20.41 billion expected

P&G reported fiscal third-quarter net income attributable to the company of $3.75 billion or $1.52 per share up from $3.4 billion or $1.37 per share a year earlier.

Net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. Organic sales which strip out acquisitions divestitures and foreign currency increased 3% in the quarter.

But the company's quarterly volume was flat for the second consecutive quarter. In October executives said they anticipated returning to volume growth in fiscal 2024. Three quarters in the company hasn't yet lured back many of the customers it scared away with its price hikes over the last two years.

However three of P&G's divisions reported volume growth for the quarter. Its beauty segment which includes Olay and Pantene saw volume rise 1% fueled by innovation in personal care. The company's grooming business home to its Gillette and Venus razors reported volume growth of 2%. And fabric and home care which includes Febreze and Swiffer saw 1% volume growth.

But P&G's health care and baby feminine and family care divisions saw volume drop further. The company blamed its higher prices and a weaker cold and flu season for the declines.

Geography also played a role in the company's lackluster sales. China the company's second-largest market is still seeing softer demand for products like its pricey SK-II skin care. Schulten also said that some markets particularly in the Middle East have seen retailers pull back on promotions amid geopolitical tensions tied to the war in Gaza.

""The impact is visible but limited and we expect it to lessen obviously hopefully as these tensions ease over time"" he said.

In the U.S. P&G's largest market the company's volume grew 3%. Schulten said the U.S. consumer isn't trading down or changing shopping behavior.

""Consumers don't want to take a gamble when it comes to the type of performance ... they know ultimately the price for trading down"" he said.

For the full year P&G is now expecting core net earnings per share growth of 10% to 11% up from its prior range of 8% to 9%. The company also raised its projection for unadjusted earnings growth to a range of 1% to 2% up from its previous forecast of down 1% to flat. P&G maintained its outlook of 2% to 4% sales growth in 2024.

P&G also now expects a $900 million benefit from favorable commodity costs up from its previous outlook of $800 million. That's a reversal from the last two fiscal years when commodity costs weighed on the company leading to price hikes.

Correction: P&G's net sales rose 1% to $20.2 billion. An earlier version misstated a figure."

Nancy Pelosi threw her support behind Schiff Thursday — if Feinstein decides to retire — and 20 current or former members of Congress from California joined the former speaker in his camp. Soon others in the state’s enormous class of Democratic officials will be similarly forced to take sides as candidates trawl for potentially valuable endorsements.

And given the close relationships among the state’s Democrats this year’s Thanksgiving could get awkward.

“Many of them served together in the state Legislature before — Barbara Lee Adam Schiff Mike Thompson — it’s a long list” said Rep. Jim Costa (D-Calif.) a Schiff backer. “We’ve known each other for you know 20 30 years. So there’s relationships.”

There’s still the possibility that other top-tier candidates could shake up the race. In recent days with the fresh memory of Rick Caruso’s stronger-than-expected showing in the Los Angeles mayoral election members of the California congressional delegation have privately discussed the possibility of a wealthy self-funded candidate launching a campaign though previous wealthy aspirants don’t boast a successful track record.

Money will be critical in the state’s expensive media markets and Pelosi’s endorsement of Schiff a longtime ally has already rippled through the world of prominent California donors. The list of backers she brought along ran the gamut geographically and ideologically: from southern California to the Bay Area and both long-serving members and relatively new frontliner Rep. Mike Levin.

It’s a significant boost for Schiff who represents wealthy suburbs around Los Angeles. While he has a healthy fundraising operation already underway in Southern California Pelosi’s critical cachet around San Francisco could help him lock down donors in the state’s two wealthiest regions. Schiff already had a head start after a competitive reelection campaign forced Porter to deplete much of her account and Lee’s fundraising has been relatively paltry.

“To have the most significant and prominent Californian in the state” and “someone who is so identified with Northern California politics endorsing Adam Schiff from the south is quite significant” said John Emerson who previously co-chaired the DNC’s southern California finance arm.

“Obviously it’s going to help from a fundraising standpoint. It’s a momentum-builder” Emerson added noting how early Pelosi backed Schiff.

Two Democrats could easily end up on the November ballot under California’s top-two primary system. While Padilla faced a Republican in the 2022 election — and trounced him by 18 points — the state’s previous two Senate races featured four Democrats: now-Vice President Kamala Harris against then-Rep. Loretta Sanchez in 2016 and Feinstein defeating then-state Sen. Kevin de León in 2018.

But the contest to succeed Feinstein is comparatively wide open. Feinstein was the longtime incumbent and Harris was an early and prohibitive frontrunner in taking the seat of outgoing Sen. Barbara Boxer who was elected alongside Feinstein in 1992. Then Padilla was appointed to fill Harris’ seat after she became vice president giving him an incumbency without the battle of a primary.

In other words some California Democrats have been waiting decades for a true run at the upper chamber. And it could be the first truly competitive U.S. Senate race under California’s top-two system.

“It’s difficult insomuch as we have friendships” said Rep. Mark DeSaulnier (D-Calif.) who hasn’t yet backed a candidate but has known Lee and Schiff for a long time. “In a state like California where you’ve got a big delegation you have a lot of opportunities to work with one another and get to know one another and become friends but you have very few opportunities to move up.”

Some members of the delegation want to see a fully-formed field before they stick their necks out.

“I think most folks are waiting to see what the actual total field looks like … But obviously there’s really great folks who have already announced” said Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) a first-term member. And others are waiting for official word on what Feinstein will do like Rep. Tony Cardenas (D-Calif.) who remains publicly undecided out of respect for the senior senator. But as Padilla’s D.C. roommate he admits he’s been “constantly asking [Padilla] what he thinks or what have you.”

Others however are worried about having too many Democratic candidates. That could fracture the liberal vote in the primary allowing a Republican to make it through to the general with a plurality alongside one Democratic frontrunner. Progressives worry that would deliver the seat to Schiff whom they view as unacceptably centrist for the state.

Liberals are already calculating how to avoid getting locked out of a general election slot.

“We cannot afford to split the progressive vote and elect somebody that takes corporate money and passes policies that increase suffering” said Amar Shergill head of the California Democratic Party’s progressive caucus. “There’s a corporate Democrat wing whether it’s Adam Schiff or the billionaire of the month. We don’t want folks that are going to follow the corporate agenda.”

Consolidating behind one candidate will be critical Shergill said — and that may involve pressuring a less viable progressives to abandon their campaigns.

“We’re going to come to a point in the calendar — probably end of summer early fall where there are going to be one or more progressive candidates in the race and we are going to tell all of them but one they need to drop out” Shergill said.

California’s large bloc of unaffiliated voters could factor heavily into the larger calculus. Many of those roughly five million voters lean Democratic and their votes could vault a contender into the general — potentially rewarding an appeal to the center.

At the same time progressives who grew increasingly dissatisfied with Feinstein are energized by the prospect of replacing her with someone to the left. That energy could benefit the candidate who can harness the California Democratic Party’s devoted leftward base.

“There is of course an ideological divide amongst Democrats. What you’re seeing right now is a strong showing among progressives” said Assemblymember Alex Lee who is part of the Legislature’s contingent of Berniecrats. “I think it’s a great position to have multiple strong progressives being considered to run.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtxZWQub3JnL25ld3MvMTE5NDAxMTQvdW5pb24tc2F5cy1jaGV2cm9uLWZpcmVkLXNldmVyYWwtcmljaG1vbmQtcmVmaW5lcnktd29ya2Vycy13aG8td2VudC1vbi1zdHJpa2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,News Radio Podcasts TV | Public Media for Northern California,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmtxZWQub3JnL25ld3MvMTE5NDAxMTQvdW5pb24tc2F5cy1jaGV2cm9uLWZpcmVkLXNldmVyYWwtcmljaG1vbmQtcmVmaW5lcnktd29ya2Vycy13aG8td2VudC1vbi1zdHJpa2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025627A695A0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

How much the agency might ease up on the proposal is not clear. The final rule will need to be approved by three of the SEC’s five commissioners including Gensler before it can take hold. But any move to substantially limit the regulation could spark a backlash from climate activists sustainable investors and progressive Democrats who have been pressing for years for greater insight into companies’ climate footprints.

Under the proposed rule public companies would have to disclose information about the climate risks their businesses face as well as the carbon emissions of parts of their operations — just as they do annual revenue executive compensation and any new updates on legal issues.

Lawmakers companies and business trade groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have voiced broad objections to the proposal ever since its introduction saying the changes are unnecessary and would be too burdensome and costly. Lawsuits are expected to challenge both the content of the rule itself and the SEC’s authority to pursue it — an argument that may carry new weight with the Supreme Court moving to rein in the so-called administrative state.

Another person familiar with the matter said the SEC has also discussed making the scope 3 requirements “more workable” for companies given the feedback the agency is getting.

If the carbon emission disclosure requirements are curtailed the SEC could preempt one of the business community’s biggest concerns about the plan.

But if the agency goes too far it risks causing a significant break with the left. Progressive lawmakers sustainability-minded investors and environmental advocates have pressed for as strong a rule as possible. They argue that predicting what the courts will do is impossible and shouldn’t discourage action now.

“The courts are obviously stacked with pro-pollution judges” a Senate Democratic aide told POLITICO. “But the SEC should not back down in the face of baseless attacks by corporate lobbyists and preemptively water down the rule.”

An SEC spokesperson declined to comment for this story.

A growing corner of the investment world has been calling on the SEC for years to require companies to provide a clearer lens into how they are handling climate change as the proposed rule would do. The final rule would also mark another major climate win for President Joe Biden following the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. One of Biden’s first executive orders declared that the federal government must push for climate-related risk disclosures across the economy.

Yet as the rule has taken shape within the agency Republican state attorneys general across the country the business world and GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill have criticized it.

Their warnings have varied. But a common one is that the SEC is going outside its mission in seeking to mandate climate risk disclosure. The significance of that complaint quickly escalated following the Supreme Court’s ruling last year that the Environmental Protection Agency overstepped its bounds in trying to rein in power plant emissions.

The SEC is seeking a broad slate of new information from public companies under the rule including details on how climate-related risks are affecting their business models if the companies use a carbon price and how and any details about climate-related goals set by the companies such as net-zero emissions targets.

Companies would also have to detail the greenhouse gas emissions from their operations and energy use.

For many larger companies though executives would face the added responsibility of disclosing estimated emissions from their supply chains and customers the scope 3 emissions. Proponents argue that scope 3 is critical to the rule’s success given the amount of a company’s emissions that it represents.

“We still think the proposal should be finalized broadly in the same form” said Alex Martin a senior policy analyst for climate and finance at Americans for Financial Reform a consumer and investor advocacy group. “It would be a mistake to not follow through.”

But groups like the National Association of Manufacturers say scope 3 emission disclosures would be riddled with legal reliability and usefulness questions for investors and companies.

“All options are on the table” said Aric Newhouse senior vice president of policy and government relations at NAM in an interview about how the group would respond to the final rule. Newhouse said that could include a lawsuit against the SEC over the rule once finalized. “We’re going to throw the full weight of the industry behind [this] effort.”

Litigation has been hanging over the SEC’s head for some time. In September while testifying on Capitol Hill Gensler was peppered with questions about the rule as many Republican senators zeroed in on the implications of the Supreme Court case West Virginia v. EPA. At the time Gensler said the SEC takes “seriously the courts and particularly the Supreme Court” but defended the agency’s ability to pursue the plan.

“Investors are using this information now and they want the information” Gensler said. “And I think it does fit into our 80- or 90-year history of how we do disclosures. … We have a role to ensure that there is not only investor protection but as the law said fair dealing that the actual disclosures are not misleading.”

Many in the legal world agree. Former SEC officials including several commissioners from both sides of the aisle academics and even one former clerk to conservative Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch have written in support of the agency’s powers to regulate corporate disclosures even if they relate to emissions.

“This is essentially core SEC rulemaking” University of Pennsylvania law Professor Jill Fisch said.

The final rule is likely to look different from the proposal no matter what as is typical for many SEC regulations.

Whether the SEC opts to include scope 3 as it is drafted in the proposal or scrap it entirely the lawsuits will come either way said Fisch though she added that scope 3 does make the rule “more vulnerable.”

The question is whether the courts will look to brush back decades of legal precedent.

“It’s very hard to predict how far the court will go” Fisch said."

A west London property used by Baroness Mone her husband Doug Barrowman and children has been put on the market for £20 million.

But the newfound fact that the home is owned by two offshore companies owned by her husband which in turn owns two tax avoidance schemes based in Malta is causing a stir.

The UK government recently published proposals clamping down on tax avoidance and non-compliant umbrella companies.

The measures give HMRC the power to close down companies involved in promoting tax avoidance and help taxpayers to identify and steer clear of avoidance schemes by naming companies including umbrella companies which it describes those in Malta as being that are under investigation by HMRC and controlled by promoters.

The Baroness Ultimo lingerie’s founder has denied owning the property but she has not identified who is behind two British Virgin Islands companies that own the companies on behalf of an offshore trust.

The Belgravia property is owned by Perree (PTC) Limited and Soldaldo (PTC) Limited which are registered to her husband’s Knox Group in the Isle of Man.

Soldaldo (PTC) in turn owns two tax avoidance schemes in Malta that were highlighted by the HMRC as late as last November. Both have found innovative ways for clients to get around paying their tax dues.

How the tax-dodging schemes work

The first Malta-based firm Gateway Outsource Solutions Ltd was named by the HMRC last August. Its clients enter an “employment agreement” with the Tigne Point-registered company.

A UK company known as GOS UK provides support to Gateway Outsource Solutions Malta by facilitating engagements with end clients and recruitment agencies.

The scheme’s users undertake work for the end client and submit timesheets either directly to GOS UK or indirectly through the user’s agency.

GOS UK invoices the end client for the user’s work and receives payment from the end client.

They then according to the HMRC receive “two salary payments one paid at national minimum wage and a second as a loan or advance which is not taxed”.

The second company Integra Resourcing Ltd meanwhile sees users entering employment contracts with Charteris Management Ltd (CML) and providing their services to end clients through CML or sometimes through an agency.

CML will invoice the end client or agency for the work and after deducting a fee pay a salary at or just above the national minimum wage. It then pays the remaining funds to the second party.

HRMC explains this second payment “is disguised as an ‘introducer fee’ as CML claims the second party introduced the scheme user to CML”.

The second party after deducting a fee then makes a larger payment to the scheme’s user “which may be labelled as a ‘loan’ ‘option’ or something else”. Neither tax nor National Insurance contributions are paid on the second payment.

Both firms are registered doors away from each other in a block at Tigne Point. Both are owned by Soldaldo (PTC) Limited of the British Virgin Islands.

The London house in question had been raided by the National Crime Agency in April 2022 as part of an investigation into PPE Medpro which won more than £200 million in government contracts after lobbying by Baroness Mone.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB0Y3B1bmphYmkuY28uaW4vcHVuamFiaS1zaW5nZXIta2FyYW4tYXVqbGEtY2FsbHMtaGlzLW1hcnJpYWdlLXJ1bW91cnMtYmFzZWxlc3PSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5wdGNwdW5qYWJpLmNvLmluL2FtcC9wdW5qYWJpLXNpbmdlci1rYXJhbi1hdWpsYS1jYWxscy1oaXMtbWFycmlhZ2UtcnVtb3Vycy1iYXNlbGVzcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Punjabi singer Karan Aujla calls his marriage rumours baseless,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.ptcpunjabi.co.in', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /punjabi-singer-karan-aujla-calls-his-marriage-rumours-baseless (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000256267CF640>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB0Y3B1bmphYmkuY28uaW4vcHVuamFiaS1zaW5nZXIta2FyYW4tYXVqbGEtY2FsbHMtaGlzLW1hcnJpYWdlLXJ1bW91cnMtYmFzZWxlc3PSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5wdGNwdW5qYWJpLmNvLmluL2FtcC9wdW5qYWJpLXNpbmdlci1rYXJhbi1hdWpsYS1jYWxscy1oaXMtbWFycmlhZ2UtcnVtb3Vycy1iYXNlbGVzcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB0Y3B1bmphYmkuY28uaW4vc29jaWFsLW1lZGlhLXNlbnNhdGlvbi1yaWRhLXRoYXJhbmEtdG8tcGFydGljaXBhdGUtaW4tbWlzcy1pbmRpYS0yMDIz0gFmaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucHRjcHVuamFiaS5jby5pbi9hbXAvc29jaWFsLW1lZGlhLXNlbnNhdGlvbi1yaWRhLXRoYXJhbmEtdG8tcGFydGljaXBhdGUtaW4tbWlzcy1pbmRpYS0yMDIz?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Social Media sensation Rida Tharana to participate in Miss India 2023,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.ptcpunjabi.co.in', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /social-media-sensation-rida-tharana-to-participate-in-miss-india-2023 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000256267CD1B0>, 'Connection to www.ptcpunjabi.co.in timed out.

The report claimed that the US has closed all licenses applied by companies in order to be able to trade with Huawei. And this decision also affected the supply of Qualcomm technologies to Huawei according to the reports.

Qualcomm Said it Can Still be Able to Ship Snapdragon Chips to Huawei

Qualcomm on the other hand has come out to make things clearer on this matter. It says the new changes by the US government does not affect its supply to Huawei.

Alex Rogers president of Qualcomm Technology Licensing (QTL) and Global Affairs made this declaration. He made this statement during the Q1 2023 earnings call. According to Rogers the recent changes from the US commerce department remain unknown to Qualcomm. Therefore the company does not see any significant impact the new changes has over its shipment to Huawei.

“So I don’t think it’s fair to characterize it as the latest restrictions on Huawei. What we’ve seen in our news reports the effect that Commerce is considering not issuing new licenses outweighs. And we haven’t heard anything from Commerce itself.” Rogers said. Gizchina News of the week Join GizChina on Telegram

He went ahead to explain further by saying that Qualcomm already has license for a while. This license allows them to ship 4G chips and WiFi chips to Huawei. The United States issued the license after it has confirmed that those chips do not pose any national security threats.

“Those will continue for some number of years and so within the scope of those licenses we don’t see an impact” Rogers added.

This news surely comes as a great relief to Huawei and its fans around the world. The reason being that it clears previous reports which claimed that the US government has intensified its ban on Huawei by barring all 4G chips Wi-Fi 6 and 7 chips as well as AI chips.

Huawei will Launch Flagship Phones with Qualcomm Snapdragon Chips this Year

Huawei has plans of releasing three new flagship devices this year. These include the Huawei P60 series Mate 60 Series as well as the latest Huawei Foldable the Mate X3. All these smartphones are tipped to use Snapdragon chips.

For now the best for Huawei to do in order not find itself in a tight corner is to pile a very large quantity of Qualcomm chips. Enough to to handle all the smartphones they plan to launch in 2023. As things stand now Qualcomm still has the license to ship to Huawei.

However Qualcomm a major chip supplier for Huawei has come forward to clarify their stance on the matter.

During the Q1 2023 earnings call Alex Rogers the President of Qualcomm Technology Licensing and Global Affairs stated that the recent changes made by the U.S. commerce department are still unknown to Qualcomm and that they do not foresee any significant impact on their shipments to Huawei. He explained that Qualcomm already holds licenses which allow them to ship 4G and other chipset technologies including Wi-Fi to Huawei. These licenses were issued after the commerce department confirmed that they posed no threat to national security and will remain in effect for a number of years.

This clarification from Qualcomm comes as a relief for the tech community as previous reports had indicated that the U.S. had barred the export of 4G Wi-Fi 6 7 and AI chipsets to Huawei. Although there are still some uncertainties this news is positive for Huawei who has planned several flagship releases this year all of which will solely use Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ chipsets. Huawei has since been unable to launch any 5G devices because U.S. restrictions cut it off from the most advanced chips needed to power such devices.

Intel and Qualcomm have established a strong presence in the Chinese market. Unfortunately the news took a toll on their stocks as Qualcomm saw a drop of 0.9% in premarket trading earlier this week in the U.S. with Intel shares following suit and declining by 0.9% as well. This outpaces the general trend in the tech industry as evidenced by the 0.4% dip in the tech-focused Nasdaq index. It’s possible that Huawei may have stockpiled a large quantity of Qualcomm chips that could last them a year but for now this news is positive and the company will probably release another statement in due time.

Among the highlights were a host of new phones – including the incredible Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra which features a 200MP camera and the all-new Samsung Galaxy Book 3 Ultra.

But while the focus may have stayed on their phones and laptops it's far from the only revelation to come out of the event. For the final ten minutes Samsung CEO TM Roh welcomed Cristiano Amon from Qualcomm and Hiroshi Lockheimer from Google to join him.

The trio discussed the role they'd all played in the new range of phones before moving on to talk about a joint venture XR project that they were working on. Amon laid out the foundations of the project saying ""We're working to create a new era of highly immersive digital experiences that blur the lines between our physical and digital worlds.""

He went on to give us a little more insight into how the project will shape up stating that it combines Google's experiences and Samsung's products with Qualcomm's technology. It certainly sounds like we'll see a Samsung branded device running a Google-based operating system with a Qualcomm chip then though any details beyond that are scarce.

But that combination could prove to be killer and would surely make for one of the best VR headsets on the market should they choose to collaborate on one. Imagine a device with the power of the S23 Ultra but built for XR tasks. One thing it doesn't sound like is another variant of the Samsung Gear VR though. That early take on the form saw users insert their phone into the front of a headset using the hardware of their handset to power the experience.

This should be a much more integrated unit similar to the Meta Quest Pro or Apple's impending Reality Pro headset. As you'd expect there's no clear date for an expected release or any further details but you can be sure that we'll be following along closely for developments."

Well Ralph Lauren has been attempting to capture its essence since 1998 when the brand first launched their Romance eau de parfum. Now this Valentine’s Day Ralph Lauren is revamping the iconic fragrance—giving us all the gift of stirring memories of the scent of blossoming love in the process. And who better to star in the campaign than real-life lovers King Princess and Quinn Wilson?

With top notes of punchy and forward mandarin essence and pink pepper middle notes of a bouquet of flirty rose jasmine geranium and an earthy patchouli dry down Romance unfolds like a love story drawing you in slowly. King Princess and Wilson describe the scent as “classic intimate woody” “floral” which they say in unison “feminine” and “fresh.”

Sure King Princess and Wilson are one of the hottest celebrity couples today—not only have they amassed a huge amount of influence over music and culture at their young ages but it’s apparent from hanging out with them even for a few minutes that they’re also very in love. They finish each other’s sentences they dance they hold hands they seem to share their own special language.

It’s not the first time the couple has shared their chemistry and adoration for Ralph Lauren; they both starred in the brand’s holiday campaign alongside Gigi Hadid Angus Cloud and Blake Gray for Ralph Lauren’s Holiday 2022 fragrance.

NYLON caught up with the couple on set for the new Romance fragrance campaign about their ideal Valentine’s Days their beauty icons and what romance means to them. (The fragrance as well as the concept of course.)

King Princess Courtesy Ralph Lauren Fragrances Quinn Wilson Courtesy Ralph Lauren Fragrances 1 / 2 INFO 1 / 2

Who are your beauty icons? What celebrities do you look up to in the beauty landscape?

Quinn Wilson: RIP Betty Davis 100% forever and ever. No one will top Betty Davis. Period.

King Princess: For me Princess Margaret because she was just so fierce. Like 12 packs a day and Saint Tropez. Lots of men. Iconic. Jennifer Coolidge obviously. Eddie Vetter or like Chris Cornell. So it's a very gender fluid answer I feel.

How would you want to spend your ideal Valentine's Day?

QW: Well you'd get me a thousand roses—you know I love my flowers. Write this down. I would love to be somewhere warm. I know that Valentine's Day doesn't scream vacation but like we've never had vacation so run it.

KP: I would like to be at our house playing PS5.

QW: So like every day like what we do every day? You heard it here folks. I want a vacation and roses and she wants PS5.

What does romance mean to you?

KP: Romance means comfortability. It means messiness and dysfunction but also friendship and camaraderie.

QW: I was gonna say friendship sisterhood. Like it kind of is. It's a weird sisterhood.

KP: What does Oprah say? She said “the mother I never had the sister I always wanted the friend everyone should have. She was talking—

QW: About Gail.

KP: Yeah she was talking about Gail.

QW: Romance to me means waking up to you every morning. It's true. You're always so sweet in the morning.

KP: Thank you.

QW: Because you're sleeping.

KP: Damn.

QW: Love you.

TAMPA Fla. – Taylor Swift. She’s broken 92 Guinness World Records and won numerous music awards for songs like “Me” and “You Need to Calm Down.” And who can forget “Shake it Off?”

Tickets for her April 13th performance at Raymond James Stadium have been selling for over $6000.00.

But The Cypress Foundation a 501(c) 3 charity organization in Orlando is hosting a concert fundraiser giving away four free lower-bowl Taylor Swift tickets to a lucky winner.

The winner will be picked through Rafflebox on Instagram Saturday April 1st at 10 a.m. At the same time the charity is hosting a “50/50 Add-on” raffle worth $300 cash to a separate winner.

In the news: Average Actual USF Attendance At Raymond James Last Season Was Less Than 17000

That winner will also be picked by Rafflebox. Both winners will be immediately notified upon completion of the drawing.

The Cypress Foundation provides help for financially limited or disadvantaged students in West Orlando helping them gain access to athletic opportunities and character development inherent in sports programs.

Andre Hock Director of The Cypress Foundation described an example of the impact of the charity’s work.

“We had a set of brothers with a great family but less than optimal athletic opportunities where they used to live. We helped with funding to help make sure the parents had the resources to send them to another school which has enabled them to receive interest from an Ivy League school and the military academies.” Hock said the family had suffered financially due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Cypress Foundation member Richard Ionelli said the organization’s goal is to raise $10000. “This concert fundraiser helps us provide opportunities that give children a chance to either play a sport they wouldn’t be able to play or to go to a school that they would not necessarily be able to.”

The charity organization’s website indicates the foundation helps defray the costs of attending private schools getting into club sports family travel and athletic equipment.

It also provides scholarships for camps and clinics saying “We provide motivated students in the West Orlando area access to resources and opportunities that enable them to contribute character ability and enthusiasm to their community.”

100% of the proceeds from the Taylor Swift concert fundraiser will go directly to the supported students and their families.

Yet Brady never mentioned what apparently is his TV future. It’s no secret that in May 2022 Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch announced the network had signed Brady to fill the seat of Troy Aikman who split to ESPN’s “Monday Night Football” where he was eventually joined by his veteran partner Joe Buck. Brady’s Fox contract is reportedly worth $375 million over 10 years.

For that kind of “retirement” scratch and a primo gig it would have also been appropriate for Brady to alert the Free World of his next stop a TV destination. Unless he’s having second thoughts about working as Fox’s No. 1 game analyst. Or unless Brady is not sure he’s ready to start the gig next season.

Tom Brady retired for the second time in a calendar year.

There are more than a few interested voices who believe Brady should make a clean albeit temporary break from the world of football. And that includes TV work. One industry source said this is more of an important “lifestyle” decision for Brady.

“He should do it for himself and his children” the source said. “The more time he takes to make the transition chances are he will find a lifestyle that benefits all involved. If that means not traveling to work in the Fox booth for at least a year well the microphone will still be there when he’s ready.”

The network doesn’t have to worry about anyone forgetting Brady should he sit out the 2023 season. If nothing else his magnified absence will build on the mystique already surrounding him. And it’s doubtful Fox suits would mind deferring the $35 million annual payment they would owe him for next season.

Also anticipation would build over when Brady would start. All the comments and commentary on how Brady will do in the booth would continue. It’s amazing how many media pundits already “know” Brady will flop. They make the prediction with no evidence unless they have discovered some secret Tom Brady audition video.

Anyway it’s not like Fox would have to scramble to find a replacement for Brady in 2023. It already is using Greg Olsen on its No. 1 team with play-by-play voice Kevin Burkhardt who will retain that gig when and if Brady starts working.

While the non-buzz team lacks big game voices Olsen and Burkhardt have developed a following based on their chemistry and insight. They are also benefitting from a Brady backlash.

Olsen has been characterized as Brady’s seat warmer which has cast him in the everyman underdog role. He’s kind of like the backup quarterback (Olsen was a three-time Pro Bowl tight end who played for 14 seasons) who fans pull for.

Burkhardt and Olsen will work Super Bowl LVII on Feb. 12 in Glendale Ariz. There has also been plenty of speculation about whether Brady will appear on Fox’s Super pregame or postgame show.

Unless his starting date at the network has been announced prior to the lights being turned off on the Super Bowl production Brady will continue providing a healthy buzz around Fox’s NFL coverage.

Without having ever entered the broadcast booth.

BENGAL GRAVE DANCING

Talk about rubbing it in.

Talk about shifting into agony overkill.

CBS Sports decided it would take the low road during the Chiefs’ celebration following their AFC title win over Cincinnati.

It wasn’t enough for CBS’ cameras to zoom in once for a closeup of Bengals’ linebacker Joseph Ossai sitting on the bench crying following his crucial mistake hitting Patrick Mahomes well out of bounds and getting flagged for unnecessary roughness.

The penalty with eight seconds left in regulation lead to Harrison Butker’s 45-yard game-winning field goal.

For reasons known only to them the CBS crew felt it necessary to air multiple shots of a despondent Ossai pulling his helmet down over his face trying to hide his tears. Guess those calling these shots in the truck at that particular moment didn’t care much about the despondent Ossai or his dignity.

EMPIRE FAILURE

As soon as the Empire State Building went green in honor of Philly’s NFC Championship win over the quarterback-less 49ers it was only a matter of time before Valley of the Stupid Gasbags and commentators from other precincts would express outrage over this “traitorous” act by ESB management.

The VOS hubbub while moronic was predictable. The real desperadoes in this scenario are politicians who couldn’t run their mouths fast enough to pander to their Giants/Jets constituency by condemning ESB management’s choice of color.

Don’t these politicians (city council people etc.) have more serious issues to deal with? Education? Street Crime? Homelessness? Midtown Ghost Town? Yet they still find time to waste whining over the color of lights on a landmark building.

DOLAN SPEAKS OUT

In the aftermath of James (Guitar Jimmy) Dolan’s recent interview with WFAN’s Craig Carton/Evan Roberts there is one loose end to consider.

While listening to Dolan answer questions about MSG’s facial recognition policy the arena’s liquor situation the Knicks and Rangers we wondered why he selected WFAN to do his state of MSG interview? After all Dolan banned former FAN (and now CBS Sports Radio) Gasbag Maggie Gray from MSG and halted advertising MSG events on the station.

Also Dolan is in business with FAN’s competitor ESPN-98.7 the radio home of the Knicks and Rangers. In the past when Dolan wanted to deliver the word he did it on 98.7’s “The Michael Kay Show.” Could it be Dolan wanted to be on C/R because it gets higher ratings than the Kay soiree?

More likely this situation can be attributed to Dolan revealing Carton is a “friend and we do talk.” And Carton saying Dolan reached out to him offering support when the FAN Talkie was released from prison in 2020.

ROMO INTERVENTION

Sorry but when we heard about CBS Sports executives holding an “intervention” with Tony Romo in his Dallas home the vision planted in our brain was more “séance.” It included Romo CBS suits and Margo the Medium who in an attempt to straighten things out summoned John Madden from the spiritual world. The vision faded with Madden repeating the same phrase over-and-over again: “Ten years $180 million oy vey.” …The images of 49ers QB’s going down during the NFC title tilt makes us wonder how long the NFL can risk wrecking the product should this ever became a trend. On his YES podcast Russ Salzberg offered a solution. He said the NFL should allow all teams to dress a third QB each week for emergency situations. The move would be separate from all other roster moves.

New ASUS GPU trade-in promotion begins today for qualifying graphics products to receive cashback from the purchase of new RTX 4080 and RTX 4070 Ti graphics cards

The new GPU Trade-In program from ASUS UK will be live starting today and will go through March 17 2023. Users will need to find participating sellers of ASUS's program to receive cashback and purchase a new ASUS GeForce RTX 4070 Ti or RTX 4080 graphics card. The amount will vary depending on the GPU traded in but users can anticipate between £50 to £300. This may not be a glamorous amount for consumers but it does allow some users to relieve themselves of older tech.

The list of qualifying ASUS RTX graphics cards are listed below:

ROG STRIX RTX 4080 16GB (ROG-STRIX-RTX4080-16G-GAMING 90YV0IC1-M0NA00)

TUF GAMING RTX 4070 Ti OC (TUF-RTX4070TI-O12G-GAMING 90YV0IJ0-M0NA00)

The graphics cards that qualified for trade-in are the least expensive GPUs from ASUS. The ASUS Radeon RX 5500 GPU will only get consumers £50 while the ASUS GeForce RTX 2080 Ti will grant consumers £300. Missing from the above list of purchasable graphics cards in the company's trade-in program is the ASUS TUF Gaming non-overclocking series.

Chrome 110 already supports RTX VSR but NVIDIA still needs to release a new driver.

NVIDIA upscaling technologies will soon enter a new dimension online video streaming will soon be improved with the power of RTX graphics. The company announced that RTX Video Super Resolution will unlock up to 4K AI upscaling with Chrome and Edge Internet browsers.

Google has just released a new early stable version of Chrome (110.0.5481.77) which is now available to a small percentage of users and will see broader release on February 7th (i.e. the actual release).

According to the official changelog Chrome 110 already supports this technology but it will still need a new driver to work. Furthermore it is now confirmed that RTX VSR will only work if enabled by users manually through NVIDIA Control Panel. It will not be enabled by default.

NVIDIA RTX VSR support Source: Chrome

NVIDIA showcased the technology working for YouTube but one can imagine that it will find a much broader use. Technically speaking nothing should stop NVIDIA and Google from allowing VSR to work with GeForce Now or even premium video streaming platforms such as Netflix. That could theoretically allow 4K videos from 1080p source and an opportunity to safe on higher membership tier.

As long as official information is considered RTX VSR will only work with GeForce RTX 30 and RTX 40 graphics cards. The RTX 20 series are also confirmed to be supported later. NVIDIA still needs to release a compatible driver which should happen sometime in late February.

Many including science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke had expected that the sight of Earth from afar would instill the belief that mankind’s future lay in space.



Instead it made Earth appear more unique and has since become an icon of the global environmental movement.

But that portrait is now a historical artifact. Fifty years later on December 8 2022 NASA took a new image of Earth from its Deep Space Climate Observatory approximately 1.5 million kilometers away. The photo reveals clear changes to the face of the Earth some of which are indicative of 50 years of climate change.

Sparked Environmentalism

The first photos taken of Earth from space were momentous historical events. In 1966 the robotic Lunar Orbiter 1 (the US’s first spacecraft to orbit the Moon) sent back some early pictures including a black-and-white image of a partly shadowed Earth. The following year a satellite called ATS-3 took the first color image of Earth.

Then in 1968 the crew of Apollo 8 became the first humans to see and photograph Earth from space. They took various photos through the capsule’s windows including the famous photo known as “Earthrise”.

This photo energized the environmental movement and helped to launch the first Earth Day in 1970. Held on April 22 each year Earth Day now involves over a billion people worldwide in activities that support environmental protection.

In 1972 NASA – aware of the public value of Earth images – resolved to capture an image of the whole Earth as Apollo 17 moved away from Earth orbit. Lit by the Sun and taken at a distance of 33000 km the photo included the first view of Antarctica from space. The image centered on Africa rather than Europe or America and became a photographic manifesto for global justice.

The Earth also provided the only visible color in space. Dominated by blue light water and clouds it appeared a unique environment that displayed no signs of human activity. “We live inside a blue chamber a bubble of air blown by ourselves” wrote cell biologist Lewis Thomas in 1973.

This was also the decade in which climate scientist James Lovelock put forward the Gaia theory of the Earth as a self-regulating set of combined living and non-living systems. “Earth systems science” as it is now known unites scientific understanding of the planet its biosphere and its changing climate.

The Impact of Climate Change

In December 2022 NASA’s new Blue Marble photograph was compared with the original image at the University of Portsmouth’s “The whole Earth: Blue Marble at 50” conference. Since 1972 the planet has visibly changed.

The Antarctic ice sheet has visibly reduced in size even though the main losses to the Larsen ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula are not visible in this particular image. Differentiating between the permanent ice sheet and seasonal sea ice is also difficult. When the new photo was taken sea ice was still in retreat from the previous winter.

While it can be hard to differentiate between snow and cloud in satellite images in the original photo some snow appears to be visible on the Zagros and Central mountain ranges in Iran (north of the Arabian Gulf). This snow has vanished entirely in the new image. However this is again within the range of seasonal variation and research has failed to identify any significant long-term trend in seasonal snow cover in Iran between 1987 and 2007.

Most striking is the reduction in dark green vegetation in the African tropics particularly at their northern extent. The dark shadow of Lake Chad in the northern Sahara has shrunk and forest vegetation now begins hundreds of miles further south.

This is consistent with evidence of desertification in north Africa’s Sahel region. Research found that tree density in the western Sahel declined by 18% between 1954 and 2002. And the UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that between 1990 and 2010 Africa lost 3–4 million hectares of forest per year a large proportion in the Sahel.

Madagascar’s once-green landscape is now mainly brown. Long renowned for its ecological richness the country is now classified as a “biodiversity hotspot” a term given to a region with significant levels of biodiversity that is threatened by rapid habitat loss.

Many species that are found exclusively in Madagascar including the Malagasy giant jumping rat are now at risk of extinction. The population declined by 88% between 2007 and 2019.

The original Blue Marble photo symbolized a historical turning point from faith in unlimited progress to understanding the limitations of the planetary environment. Most satellite technology is now focused on servicing and understanding the Earth and space exploration has confirmed just what a unique planet we inhabit.

The former Star Trek actor William Shatner felt this powerfully on his brief ride into space in 2021. On his return he remarked: “I discovered that the beauty isn’t out there it’s down here with all of us.”

The evidence of 50 years of environmental degradation is before our eyes. The space mission that really matters now is the mission to save Earth.

Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns are no strangers to one another. They were former stablemates in The Shield and have crossed paths multiple times since the group's dissension.

During a recent Instagram live Rollins addressed fans from all around the world including India. He further accused The Tribal Chief of ""ducking and dodging"" him for a match:

""Wow man you guys are all over the place. Mexico Czech Republic Israel that rocks India I love it I love it... I will fight Roman again at some point he's been ducking and dodging me for over a year now so we'll see what happens"" said Seth Rollins [10:40-10:30]

Seth Rollins recently sent a message to Roman Reigns' future opponent Cody Rhodes

Seth Rollins and Cody Rhodes have a lot of history with one another. Rhodes' first match since returning to WWE was against The Visionary.

Speaking in a recent interview with Wrestling Inc Rollins claimed that his only issue with The American Nightmare was that he tried to steal the former's spotlight. Rollins said:

""Look I never had any disrespect towards Cody Rhodes. The only disrespect I had for Cody Rhodes was that he tried to come in and steal my spotlight. I shouldn't say 'tried to steal it.' He tried to use my spotlight to catapult himself to where he wants to go. So there's nothing more selfish in the world. Don't let anything fool you. Cody Rhodes is a selfish S.O.B. He's not coming back for anything but himself.""

Rhodes who won the 30-Man Royal Rumble Match will face Roman Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Title at WrestleMania. A victory for him could potentially lead toward a fourth Rhodes vs. Rollins match.

No illnesses have been reported as a result of this recall to date. But the FSIS is urging consumers not to eat these products and throw away or return them to their place of purchase.

Conagra Brands produced the recalled meats between Dec. 12 2022 and Jan. 13 2023 and shipped them to retail stores nationwide.

The affected cans also have the code “P4247″ inscribed on the bottom of the can near the “best by” date.

Conagra Brands discovered the problem when it noticed “spoiled and/or leaking cans from multiple production dates” at its warehouse according to the agency.

The company saw that the cans were damaged in a way that could allow foodborne bacteria to get in and contaminate the meat. However it’s not easy for customers to see the damage.

You can find the full list of products affected here.

RCL,Royal Caribbean Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzAyLzA0LzMtcmVhc29ucy1pbS1idWxsaXNoLW9uLXJveWFsLWNhcmliYmVhbi1zdG9jay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Reasons I'm Bullish on Royal Caribbean Stock,"Demand for Royal Caribbean cruises is accelerating.

After enduring a slump of nearly three years Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) is finally seeing a wave of pent-up revenge travel. While cruising is clearly making a comeback Royal Caribbean stock still trades more than 52% down from pre-pandemic highs. My personal opinion is to buy the dip on this cruise-line stock while it lasts. Here's why.

1. Bookings surpass pre-pandemic levels

Citing ""a substantial acceleration in demand"" for cruises this year CEO Jason Liberty said in the company's third-quarter earnings call that bookings doubled between Q2 2022 and Q3 2022. Liberty affirmed that booking volumes stood ""considerably higher"" than in the same period in 2019.

Third-quarter revenue last year landed at nearly $3 billion thanks to a combination of price increases a rebound in demand and onboard passenger revenue generation. Liberty pointed out that Royal Caribbean's guests spent ""significantly more onboard our ships compared to 2019 across nearly all categories"" and that their experiences have led to increased booking activity.

Royal Caribbean closed out Q3 2022 with the first profit in almost three years -- $33 million. While not so impressive on its own compared to 2021's net loss of $1.4 billion in Q3 a small profit looks promising. After all the Celebrity Cruises operator still contends with a fragile supply chain heightened operating expenses and inflationary pressures.

Despite opposing currents and billions in long-term debt Royal Caribbean is signaling recovery to the long-term investor.

2. Big plans for 2023

Royal Caribbean has plenty in store to entice cruisers aboard. After successful tests onboard the Wonder of the Seas and Symphony of the Seas cruise ships a new dining menu has been introduced fleetwide offering fee-based upgrades and exciting cuisine themes.

The Silver Nova a new eco-friendly luxury vessel from Silversea Cruises is set to launch this year. The revolutionary cruise ship will utilize technology including fuel cells and liquefied natural gas (LNG) engines to reduce its impact on the environment.

Late this year Royal Caribbean plans to launch the Ultimate World Cruise a 274-night voyage across 65 countries and 150 destinations. Sure to attract new customers this once-in-a-lifetime offering will sail around the world from Miami to destinations including South America and the Middle East.

Last but not least the highly anticipated Icon of the Seas ship will be delivered in late 2023. Scheduled to debut in 2024 the Icon will emerge as the world's largest cruise ship at 250000 tons and boast a massive floating waterpark. According to Liberty the first day of bookings for Icon ""far surpassed our previous single-day booking record for the brand and the company overall and it wasn't even close.""

3. The future looks bright

With its 64-ship fleet now fully operational Royal Caribbean is looking to book as many cruises as possible during the current season -- a period after the holidays when cruise companies offer promotional rates. Although Chief Financial Officer Naftali Holtz anticipates higher expenses to persist in the near term he forecasts that improved occupancy rates a replenished staff and more relaxed COVID protocols will boost profit margin in future quarters.

2022's Q3 already enjoyed a 50% increase in bookings year over year and investors should pay close attention to future quarters' performance to ensure Royal Caribbean remains on course. The company plans to release fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 financial results on Feb. 7.

According to Liberty ""The future of the Royal Caribbean Group is bright"" suggesting growth in the near future. If the company continues to recover as it has Royal Caribbean stock should soon follow suit. For these reasons I remain bullish on the stock.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbGF3YWl0cy5jb20vMjg1NTY5Ni90aXBzLWZvci1jcnVpc2luZy1yb3lhbC1jYXJpYmJlYW4td2l0aC1ncmFuZGNoaWxkcmVuL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,I Just Sailed On Royal Caribbean With My Grandchildren — Here Are My 10 Key Tips,"I never get to spend enough time with my grandchildren. They’re getting older now and very involved in their own activities. So when my daughter told me she’d booked a cruise on Royal Caribbean with them for the holidays my husband and I offered to come along.

No matter which Royal Caribbean ship you cruise on — they have 20+ ships in their fleet from smaller boats with fewer decks to 5000-passenger Oasis-class ships — what you can count on is outstanding live shows and entertainment flexible dining options family-friendly cabin design and a Kids Club for those 6 months to 17 years old. These are just some of the perks that make cruising with Royal Caribbean an ideal multi-gen vacation especially for seniors.

For us Royal Caribbean’s Allure Of The Seas provided the perfect backdrop to create lasting memories. I looked at the pictures of the ship out of Galveston Texas and knew it would be an over-the-top experience. The departure port and parking were convenient so I embarked on the ship along with my daughter and her husband plus their four children.

The cruise was fabulous and we made so many wonderful memories together. Here are my key tips if you cruise on Royal Caribbean with your grandchildren.

Note: I was a guest of Royal Caribbean’s Allure of the Seas but my opinions are my own.

1. Download The Royal Caribbean App As Soon As Possible

The Royal Caribbean International app allows you to do so many things like plan your port excursions ahead of time or reserve activities like cupcake decorating or sushi-making classes — such fun things to do together. Many fill up and are sold out so download the app ASAP. You can also make show and dining reservations and buy beverage and internet packages. The best part is you can actually plan each day of your cruise before you even set sail.

Set Up Your Onboard Chats

If you’re cruising with extended family or friends your most important communication is with them. “Where are you? What time are we going to dinner? are destined to be your most common queries. The app allows you to set up a chat with the members of your group by connecting to the free Wi-Fi.

You’ll see three dots in the top right. Open it and invite members of your party to join the chat. Once they accept your invitation to connect you’re free to message them with pertinent details. It took me 2 days to figure this out.

2. Study The List Of Shows And Events

Mamma Mia! Hairspray and Grease are just a few of the popular onboard musicals offered by Royal Caribbean and they’re all family-friendly. Make sure you make your reservations on your app as soon as you can as the shows tend to fill up.

We loved the performance of Mamma Mia! and sang all of the songs together. The Ice Games show was spectacular as well keeping everyone mesmerized with skating skills flips and athletic prowess.

My granddaughter Riley really wanted to go to the ’70s party on the promenade. We joined hundreds of other disco lovers as we danced late into the night. Another evening she wanted to do the HUSH Silent Party. She knew what it was. I had no idea. You put on headphones and tune into the same DJ spinning the songs. There’s no loud music to talk over and we had an awesome time belting out our favorite songs.

Karaoke and a Family Feud–style game also let us create great memories together. Ditto for the carousel and mini-golf on the Boardwalk.

What to take a spin on the ice yourself? Don your skates and off you go on the ice skating rink available on all Voyager Freedom and Oasis-class ships. If you dare zipline across the ship or take the challenge on the rock climbing wall (found on Oasis-class ships); if not watch your grandkids do it with ease. And for something a little tamer ride the carousel at sea (found on Oasis-class ships) or try the bumper cars (found on Quantum-class ships).

3. Creatively Shout Out Your Family Name

It was very cute to see three and four generations of families all wearing the same T-shirts hoodies or pajamas on board. I wished I had thought of that.

4. Try New Things

This is your chance to be open to new experiences. When you go off on your shore excursions take a moment to talk with the locals and ask them about their lives. Expose your grandchildren to different cultures and give them a chance to broaden their understanding of a world very different from their own.

Even if you don’t choose an excursion get off the boat and walk around the port. Taste a new fruit at a stand. Check out the local snacks chips and candies. You may acquire some new favorites. Buy some souvenirs that will provide a lasting memento of your adventures.

I brought my granddaughter to the Art Auction and she learned about artists Marc Chagall Pablo Picasso and Peter Max. I think this is just the kind of thing that will stay with her.

5. Check Out The Adventure Ocean Kids’ Club

There are times when you all need a little downtime and Royal Caribbean’s award-winning Kids Club is just the thing — plus it’s complimentary.

The clubs are divided into age groups and trained professionals work with the kids. Aquanauts is for kids 3–5 where my grandson Blake had a ball singing creating arts and crafts and playing games with the others. Explorers is for children 6–8 and my other grandson Rory was happy to do science projects talent shows and ice cream parties. For tweens 9–12 my granddaughter Bella did karaoke played video games and went on backstage tours. I saw teens playing in basketball tournaments enjoying FlowRider surf simulators and ziplining over the boat. My granddaughter Riley was happy to hang out in the teen lounge with her other friends.

Note that the hours vary from sea days to port days. Extended babysitting hours are also available for a fee. All ships (besides the Adventure of the Seas Explorer of the Seas and Jewel of the Seas) include nurseries for the littlest ones.

Pro Tip: Be sure to register your children on embarkation day. My daughter also signed a waiver so that both my husband and I could pick up the kids.

6. When In Port Stay On Ship Time

Some of the ports we visited were in a different time zone either an hour ahead or behind. Your best bet is to keep your watch on ship time so you don’t miss the boat when your ship is ready to depart. This is especially important if you’re on an excursion not sanctioned by the cruise line.

Pro Tip: Port days have different dining room schedules than sea days. Be sure to check the daily Cruise Compass to confirm their hours.

7. Explore All Onboard Dining Options

The great thing about Royal Caribbean is that they offer so many places to eat from epicurean culinary adventures to something quick and easy at the Windjammer Buffet.

Kids love Johnny Rockets (an upcharge) but there are other specialty restaurants on Royal Caribbean ships. Oasis-class ships have Boardwalk Hot Dogs and The Donut Shop in their Boardwalk neighborhoods and most ships have Sorrento’s pizza Cafe Promenade and soft-serve ice cream stations that are included with your cruise.

If you’re looking for a quieter place to eat on an Oasis-class ship head to the Park Café located in Central Park. They offer soup salads and sandwiches along with great desserts. Once I discovered it we had lunch there every day. I particularly enjoyed the make-your-own salad bar and prime rib sandwiches.

The same is true with the Solarium (found on every Royal Caribbean ship) for breakfast. They offer the same delicious hot and cold buffet as the Windjammer but it’s much smaller and easier to find your group or to find a place for your group.

8. Bring That Hawaiian Shirt

We were hesitant about packing one of those colorful Hawaiian shirts but my husband was glad he did. He wore it several times especially at Caribbean night.

9. Take Your Formal Pictures Before Your Last Night

We had planned to take cruise pictures on the last night but there were no formal photography services or backdrops available. So we ran around the ship in our jeans with matching-colored t-shirts and found some cute spots to take our own.

10. Take Shore Excursions

Part of the joy of cruising is having new experiences in port that range from exotic beaches ATV adventures cultural experiences and outdoor recreation. Before you decide which excursions to book talk to your grandkids about what interests them and go from there.

Royal Caribbean offers an amazing collection of remarkable shore excursions on the island of Barbados: you can swim with the turtles and observe sea turtles in their natural habitat. Hike through the rainforest and go tubing in an underground cave system in Belize. Visit the Chacchoben Ruins in Costa Maya. Your grandkids will love to swim with the stingrays in the shallow sandbars of Grand Cayman. Sailing with Royal Caribbean to the Bahamas means a stop at CocoCay their own private island with access to a beautiful beach food drinks and more.

The Allure stopped in British Honduras as well as Costa Maya and Cozumel Mexico. Snorkeling diving and visiting Gumbalimba Park to hang out with monkeys and parrots was the highlight of Roatan Honduras. Costa Maya is a little more laid back and we went ashore to buy some of the artisan crafts. In Cozumel we visited a chocolate factory to watch the manufacturing process. Of course we got to sample the delicious chocolate and bring a few bars home.

All too soon it was time to return and go ashore in Galveston but we were filled with memories of quality family time we spent together and adventures we would never forget aboard Royal Caribbean’s Allure.

Pro Tip: If disabilities are an issue for you or your party not to worry. There were plenty of people aboard enjoying the cruise in walkers wheelchairs and motorized vehicles.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmphbWFpY2FvYnNlcnZlci5jb20vMjAyMy8wMi8wNC9zYW5kYWxzLXRlYW0tbWVtYmVycy1tZW50b3ItZmxhbmtlci1zdHVkZW50cy0yMDIzMTAyMy0wNjExLTAxNjc0My_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Sandals team members mentor Flanker students,"TEAM members from Sandals Resorts in the Montego Bay region have launched the resort’s Mentorship 2.0 programme at Flanker Primary and Infant School by sharing special sessions with the school population inclusive of grade six students who will be sitting the Primary Exit Profile examinations this year.

The resorts — Sandals Montego Bay and Sandals Royal Caribbean — have also been assisting with providing meals for students attending the PEP Saturday classes so they have a proper nutritional programme as they prepare for their exams.

The group of enthusiastic mentors on January 26 staged role plays and sought to build the self-esteem of the students as well as heighten their confidence particularly those taking the exams.

The mentorship session will take place once per month and will feature Sandals team members from various departments at the two resorts.

The students expressed their gratitude for the advice and love shared by the team members and thanked them for caring enough to take time out of their busy work schedule to impart their knowledge and experience with them.

Ian Spencer the company’s regional public relations manager for Montego Bay said “Our team members were happy and very receptive to becoming mentors to the Flanker Primary students. Many of them have had their lives transformed by mentors in their formative years and saw this opportunity as a way of giving back.”

Spencer noted that his company was delighted to provide this level of support for the students understanding well the level of anxiety associated with PEP and other internal exams as well as the challenges young people face fitting into today’s society.

The sessions are being dubbed Mentorship 2.0 because this is an upgraded version of those undertaken in the past featuring more interaction with the mentees.

“Our team members were cognisant of the fact that students are in need of role models and guidance” Spencer said. “My team understands what these kids are going through as they have all been there. This is really a labour of love and one we are very happy to perform.”

The Sandals regional PR manager was effusive in his praise for Flanker Primary Principal Collette Barnes who has overseen a transformation of the school and re-energised the surrounding communities to assist the institution. “We have created a dynamic partnership with the principal and by extension the school population” Spencer observed. “And we are steadfast in our efforts to transform the lives of the next generation of Jamaican leaders.”

Principal Barnes lauded the efforts of the Sandals team in coming to the assistance of the school and said she was looking forward to a continued long-term relationship. “We have developed a great partnership with Sandals and other business enterprises which has assisted greatly in the improvements at our institutions” Barnes noted.

Jonique Bramwell a member of Sandals’ entertainment department said she was more than happy to donate her time to the mentorship effort as her growth had been fuelled by her own mentors. “I am proud to be giving back to our country’s youth particularly in Flanker a community about which some people have a negative perception” she highlighted.",,,,,,

Duke University/Instagram Jerry Seinfeld gives the commencement address at Duke University on May 12 2024

Jerry Seinfeld has some apologies to offer nearly two decades after the release of Bee Movie.

On Sunday May 12 the Seinfeld alum 70 gave a commencement address to the graduating seniors at Duke University in Durham North Carolina — where his son Julian currently attends and his daughter Sascha previously graduated from.

During his speech the comedian took time to reflect on his 2007 animated film Bee Movie — specifically one controversial element of the storyline.

""I made a cartoon movie about bees you may have watched as a child"" Seinfeld said in a video captured by an attendee and shared on TikTok.

""If any of you felt slightly uncomfortable about the sexual undertones in the relationship between Barry B. Benson and Vanessa the florist who saves his life I would like to apologize for that now"" he continued earning laughs from the crowd. ""I may not have calibrated that perfectly.""

Fans of the DreamWorks kids' movie have previously made long-running jokes about the romantic tension between Seinfeld's character in the film Barry (a bee) and Renée Zellweger's character Vanessa (a human). Back in October 2021 Seinfeld addressed the same issue during an appearance on The Tonight Show apologizing once again for the innuendo.

""I apologize for what seems to be a certain uncomfortable subtle sexual aspect of the Bee Movie"" he said at the time. ""[It] really was not intentional but after it came out I realized this is really not appropriate for children. Because the bee seems to have a thing for the girl and we don’t really want to pursue that as an idea in children’s entertainment.""

Seinfeld's commencement speech at Duke also drew public attention when anti-war protesters walked out of the ceremony and booed from the audience when the TV star took the podium according to NBC News and CBS News.

Seinfeld has been making a slew of public appearances in recent weeks in support of his newest movie Unfrosted which marks his feature-film directorial debut. Speaking with PEOPLE at the premiere of the movie on April 30 Seinfeld opened up about taking on the role of director for the first time in his career.

""You don't want to think about that this is a really big important job. Like the pilot never wants to come on the PA system and go 'I'm going to try and get this plane in the air.' You have to be confident"" he said.

Seinfeld previously told PEOPLE that he has ""been obsessed with Pop-Tarts my whole life"" which is what inspired him to take on the movie.

""My friend Spike Feresten who was a writer on my show and is still a good friend of mine thought we should make a movie out of the story the real story which we did"" he explained.



Unfrosted — which features a star-studded cast including Melissa McCarthy Jim Gaffigan Hugh Grant and more — is set in 1963 Battle Creek Mich. when ""Kellogg's and Post sworn cereal rivals race to create a pastry that will change the face of breakfast forever"" according to a synopsis.

Property developers have taken note and many are now designing new apartments with remote workers in mind.

About 35% of U.S. job holders are able to work remotely full-time and 28% can do so some of the time according to a survey McKinsey & Co. published last year. Meanwhile many companies in response to changing workplace habits are shedding larger-than-necessary office spaces as work is done less in offices and more in employees’ homes.

But remote work can be a drag in tiny apartments or ones designed without it in mind. During the pandemic employees living in small apartments often struggled. Carmine Di Sibio CEO of consulting firm EY told Fortune in November 2020: “We have a lot of young people who are in small apartments around the world and being in a small apartment in this environment is just not great. We have had more people calling our hotlines wanting help just from a mental state.”

Apartments for remote workers

Today many developers and designers have remote workers in mind.

Near Walmart’s headquarters an architecture firm called Verdant Studios in Rogers Ark. is designing multifamily developments with an eye toward remote and hybrid workers including community spaces for co-working.

“We’re designing for at-home workspace in a way that we have never done pre-COVID” CEO Jessica Hester told Talk Business & Politics. “Making sure people have access to comfortable well-lit desk space has become a priority.”

Even the way units will look in video calls is being considered she added: “Three years ago we would’ve never thought about what the background looks like on a Zoom call. Those are things we’re thinking about as we place that kind of space in a residential environment.”

A high-end development in Broomfield Colo. near Denver—called The Lock at Flatirons Apartments—will have co-working units. Likewise outside Dallas in Garland Texas an upcoming 340-unit apartment project called iThirty will offer future tenants access to a remote-work lounge.

Reducing office space

Meanwhile many large employers are abandoning office space that makes little sense now.

For example in the Twin Cities Thomson Reuters is giving up a sprawling campus in Eagan where about 5000 employees worked before the pandemic. Now the company will use smaller and more flexible office space with hybrid work in mind according to the Star Tribune.

“We want to create a modern energized and collaborative work environment that fully supports our hybrid ways of working for our office-based roles” said Paul Fischer president of Thomson Reuters Legal Professionals and co-site lead for the company’s local campus last year.

“Given the vacancy level in our buildings” he added the campus “is too large for the company’s current needs.”

At Slack a subsidiary of San Francisco–based Salesforce chief of staff Robby Kwok said last month the occupancy rate at some Salesforce offices is “still well below 20%” and “some of them are below 10%.” He added “It’s really hard to justify having all of that space.”

And Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff who last year slammed return-to-office mandates said real estate “is going to be a major part” of the software giant’s attempt to reduce costs by as much $5 billion.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbGNhbGlzdGVjaC5jb20vY3RlY2huZXdzL2FydGljbGUvcnkzZm9tNjJv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Novidea announces appointments of Chief Customer Officer and Chief Finance Officer,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiOGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNhbGNhbGlzdGVjaC5jb20vY3RlY2huZXdzL2FydGljbGUvcnkzZm9tNjJv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000256267F7E80>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Namely your kitchen cabinets. If you’re going the paint route here a timeless color that will last you a lifetime is the way to go. That way you might need a touch-up here and there to account for paint chips from daily wear and tear but you won’t have to worry about your cabinets looking dreadfully outdated in just a decade.

Future-minded homeowners are in luck because we’ve gathered a selection of top Southern designers’ picks for colors that will never go out of fashion. To make sure that the look of your cabinets will age well designers recommend avoiding yellowy whites sage greens bright colors or even grays—all of which they say are either outdated or on their way out. Instead these designers are all for well-loved neutrals and neutral-adjacent deep color tones.

“Paint colors are hard to categorize as they each have a different personality of their own depending on the situation they were chosen for” explain Vy Truong and Han Dang the co-founders and principal designers of Very Handsome Studio in Houston Texas. “However without fail it seems that neutrals will never go out of style.”

Stick to these timeless shades for kitchen cabinets that you can rely on staying stylish.

The Post-Journal and OBSERVER have been analyzing real estates sales in Chautauqua County and recently looked at the sales from Sept. 16-30.

During that time period Chautauqua Mall LLC of Columbus Ohio sold 318 East Fairmount Ave. Lakewood to Chautauqua Mall Realty Holdings LLC of Great Neck NY for $6 million. The Chautauqua Mall website lists Kohan Retail Investment Group as the new owner.

The Post-Journal/OBSERVER previously reported the sale Jan. 10. Kohan Retail Investment Group now owns roughly 70 malls across the country including the McKinley Mall in Buffalo. Kohan purchased the Chautauqua Mall from the Washington Prime Group which was formed in 2014 following a spinoff from the Simon Property Group.

Washington Prime operates about 100 malls across the country but the months since the company emerged from bankruptcy have seen its property portfolio decrease. Washington Prime filed for bankruptcy on June 13 2021. Many of its properties were already weakened as consumers began shopping more online and less in brick-and-mortar stores.

Then the COVID-19 pandemic led many malls to be closed including for a time in New York state and crippled revenue streams for Washington Prime. The company emerged from bankruptcy in October 2021 with its debt reduced by nearly $1 billion. It now operates as a private holding company with majority ownership by SVPGlobal which had been Washington Prime’s biggest creditor when the bankruptcy filing began.

There was another seven-digit sale from Sept. 16-30. Lawrence and Daryl Spacciapolli sold 373 Fairmount Ave. Lakewood to JSEK West Seneca LLC of Elma NY for $1.3 million. This is the location of the former Larry Spacc Lakewood Resale.

Joseph Spino of Elma is looking to build a Blue Buffalo Car Wash at that address. Site plans previously submitted to the Lakewood Village Board call for the removal of the building on the property and construction of a new 3150 square foot facility.

The village board held a public hearing on the project Aug. 22. Afterward village officials approved the site plan review of the project.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm9ic2VydmVydG9kYXkuY29tL25ld3MvdG9wLXN0b3JpZXMvMjAyMy8wMi9jaGF1dGF1cXVhLW1hbGwtZnV0dXJlLWNhci13YXNoLXNpdGUtYW1vbmctdG9wLXNlcHRlbWJlci1zYWxlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Chautauqua Mall future car wash site among top September sales,"The cost of what the Chautauqua Mall sold for has been revealed.

Molly posted a pic of herself wearing pink leisurewear holding her precious arrival who was wrapped in a white blanket.

The influencer was looking dotingly at her baby and stroking her face.

Molly captioned the image: ""The nights are the hardest but also the most special.""

She continued: ""You have completely stolen my heart little girl. There is nothing I wouldn't do for you.""

It comes as Molly and Tommy melted fans hearts as they stepped out for the first time with Bambi yesterday.

They enjoyed a Saturday stroll as a family around the chic neighbourhood of Hale Cheshire.

The stars followed in the footsteps of new mums and dads everywhere taking their first Saturday stroll with their precious cargo.

Molly-Mae took the lead and pushed Bambi along in her car seat stroller while boxer Tommy carried their very expensive baby bag - a Gucci GG Supreme worth over £1700.

The former Love Island couple also matched in black jackets and Molly teamed hers with leggings grey socks and Ugg boots.

The Youtube star looked lovingly at Bambi having told fans she is absolutley obsessed with her new bundle of joy.

Molly-Mae and Tommy enjoyed quality time together with Bambi before he jets off on his next fight.

Tommy is scheduled to meet YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul in a catchweight fight on February 26 in Saudi Arabia.

Tommy was forced to pull out in December 2021 due to a rib injury and then last August amid US visa issues.

Jake Paul then broke the news about Tommy and Molly's baby had been born - and has since refused to apologise.

Molly gave birth on January 23 to Bambi.

And while Molly-Mae is soaking in every waking moment with her daughter it seems work is never far from her mind as her next venture is already underway - At Home With The Furys.

The fly on the wall TV docu-series has been filmed for Netflix and the pair will star along side Tommy's brother boxer Tyson Fury and Tyson's wife Paris.

Though the company’s 150-car train in Ohio reportedly burst into 100-foot flames upon derailing — and was transporting materials that triggered a fireball when they were released and incinerated — it was not being regulated as a “high-hazard flammable train” federal officials told the Lever. Documents show that when current transportation safety rules were first created a federal agency sided with industry lobbyists and limited regulations governing the transport of hazardous compounds. The decision effectively exempted many trains hauling dangerous materials — including the one in Ohio — from the “high-hazard” classification and its more stringent safety requirements. Amid the lobbying blitz against stronger transportation safety regulations Norfolk Southern paid executives millions and spent billions on stock buybacks — all while the company shed thousands of employees despite warnings that understaffing is intensifying safety risks. Norfolk Southern officials also fought off a shareholder initiative that could have required company executives to “assess review and mitigate risks of hazardous material transportation.” The sequence of events began a decade ago in the wake of a major uptick in derailments of trains carrying crude oil and hazardous chemicals including a New Jersey train crash that leaked the same toxic chemical as in Ohio. In response the Obama administration in 2014 proposed improving safety regulations for trains carrying petroleum and other hazardous materials. However after industry pressure the final measure ended up narrowly focused on the transport of crude oil and exempting trains carrying many other combustible materials including the chemical involved in this weekend’s disaster. Then came 2017: after rail industry donors delivered more than $6 million to GOP campaigns the Trump administration — backed by rail lobbyists and Senate Republicans — rescinded part of that rule aimed at making better braking systems widespread on the nation’s rails. Specifically regulators killed provisions requiring rail cars carrying hazardous flammable materials to be equipped with electronic braking systems to stop trains more quickly than conventional air brakes. Norfolk Southern had previously touted the new technology — known as electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brakes — for its “potential to reduce train stopping distances by as much as 60 percent over conventional air brake systems.” But the company’s lobby group nonetheless pressed for the rule’s repeal telling regulators that it would “impose tremendous costs without providing offsetting safety benefits.” That argument won out with Trump officials — and the Biden administration has not moved to reinstate the brake rule or expand the kinds of trains subjected to tougher safety regulations. When current transportation safety rules were first created a federal agency sided with industry lobbyists and limited regulations governing the transport of hazardous compounds. “Would ECP brakes have reduced the severity of this accident? Yes” Steven Ditmeyer a former senior official at the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) told the Lever. “The railroads will test new features. But once they are told they have to do it . . . they don’t want to spend the money.” Norfolk Southern did not answer questions about its efforts to weaken safety mandates. The company also did not answer questions about what kind of braking system was operating on the train that derailed in Ohio. The company referred the Lever to the National Transportation Safety Board the federal agency that is investigating the accident and that had originally called for more expansive rules governing the transport of hazardous materials. A spokesperson for one advocacy group pressing for tougher safety regulations said the Ohio disaster is the latest consequence of the rail industry’s cost cutting profit-at-all-cost business model. “Prior to the stock buyback era railroads agreed that ECP brakes were a good thing” said Ron Kaminkow a longtime railroad worker and organizer with Railroad Workers United. “The railroads hadn’t yet come to the realization that they could do whatever they wanted. ECP brakes were on the drawing board then off.”

“Fast as the Speed of Light” The vast majority of the nation’s trains continue to rely on a braking system first developed in 1868. Trains equipped with these traditional air brakes make emergency stops more slowly and with higher rates of damage than trains equipped with ECP brakes according to both safety advocates and the Federal Railroad Administration. While air brakes stop train cars individually as air pressure moves sequentially from one car to the next ECP brakes operate using an electronic signal and can stop an entire train much faster. As one railroad industry insider told the Washington Post anonymously in 2016: “Trains are like giant Slinkies. When you have that back of the train running into the front of the train they can actually push cars out cause a derailment and cause a hell of a mess.” ECP braking the analyst said takes “the energy out of the train quicker so when a train does derail there is less energy that has to be absorbed by crushing tank cars.” Beginning in the 2000s federal rail regulators pushed the rail industry to upgrade to electronic brakes that would lead to shorter stop times. After a 2006 technical report commissioned by the FRA concluded that ECP “could significantly enhance rail safety and efficiency” the agency took the position of promoting widespread adoption of the technology. The railroads including Norfolk Southern were initially outspoken advocates of the new equipment. Electronic brakes were so safe the companies argued that regulators could exempt upgraded trains from other safety mandates saving time and money on frequent stops for safety inspections. During a 2007 hearing before the Federal Railroad Administration Donald Usak manager of engineering for Norfolk Southern’s fleet testified to the “big advantage for emergency braking” offered by the new systems. “We all know the saying ‘as fast as the speed of light’” Usak said. “So does electricity travel at the speed of light. Signals from the engineer are at the rear of the train instantly. Signals initiated at any one of the vehicles in the train are throughout that train instantly.” Later that year when reporting its quarterly earnings Norfolk Southern bragged to investors that it had “made railroad history” by equipping one of its trains exclusively with the new ECP technology and announced plans to add the safety feature to thirty more of its trains in the coming months. But the industry abruptly changed its tune once regulators moved in 2014 to make the upgrades mandatory. That year — after a series of high-profile rail accidents — the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration proposed a regulation requiring train cars carrying hazardous materials to be retrofitted with safety features including ECP brakes over a period of nearly a decade. The proposed regulation also imposed speed limits on trains carrying hazardous materials and required volatility tests for the substances being transported. The railroad oil and chemical industries came out in full force against the regulation arguing the new requirements would be disruptive and costly. The Association of American Railroads (AAR) — a lobbying group to which Norfolk Southern has long been a dues-paying member — in particular fought the ECP braking standards. “AAR strongly opposes any requirement to use ECP brakes” the association said in one of multiple comment letters on the rule. “ECP brakes would be extremely costly without providing an offsetting benefit . . . [the Federal Railroad Administration] assumed that business benefits would more than compensate for the costs of ECP brakes but [the] industry to this day has not identified business benefits that would justify transitioning to ECP brakes.” Norfolk Southern also reported lobbying against “requiring ECP brakes” during the rule-making process. In a 2015 legislative testimony Norfolk Southern’s vice president Rudy Husband told Pennsylvania lawmakers that while the company planned to comply with the new rule the “rail industry has serious concerns about the ECP brake requirements and the potential adverse impacts on the fluidity of the national freight rail network.”

A Hazard by Any Other Name Alongside their campaign to kill the brake rule industry lobbyists pushed to limit the types of chemical compounds that would be covered by new regulations including the brake rule. They proposed limiting the definition of “high-hazard flammable trains” or HHFT mostly to cover oil trains — but not trains carrying the industrial chemical on the Norfolk Southern train that necessitated evacuations in Ohio. “It would be inappropriate to include those other flammable liquids in the rule without assessing how and in what quantities they are shipped and what risks are associated with their transportation” wrote the American Chemistry Council which lobbies for chemical companies in its letter asking regulators to limit the rule. By contrast the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) the federal agency tasked with investigating transportation accidents argued for a broader definition of “high-hazard flammable trains.” The agency pointed out that the industry’s own classifications of which hazardous materials should trigger more stringent safety precautions were broader than those in the proposed rule. Citing an AAR memo on the topic the NTSB wrote that “the railroad industry recognizes that additional safety precautions including speed restrictions are needed for key trains that transport any hazardous materials.” The NTSB explicitly called for the rules to cover Class 2 flammable gases — a category that includes vinyl chloride the chemical that was transported by the Ohio train that derailed. Regulators also noted that “comments from the concerned public local government tribal communities towns and cities voiced concern” that the industry’s proposed definitions of “high-hazard flammable trains” were too narrow — and some commenters “even suggested that a train consisting of one or more tank cars carrying crude oil or any other hazardous material should be classified as an HHFT.” One mayor of a rail-trafficked Chicago suburb told regulators: “We support comments seeking to insure that all tank cars used in the transport of Class 2 flammable hazmat not only those in HHFTs will be covered by the agencies’ new rules.”

“The Costs of the ECP Rule Substantially Outweigh Its Benefits” In 2015 the Obama administration issued the new transportation rule which was far less stringent and wide-ranging than safety advocates had demanded. The final regulation’s definition of “high-hazard flammable trains” was not expanded as the NTSB requested and the regulations applied only to trains with more than twenty of cars in a single block carrying hazardous materials or thirty-five located throughout the train. However the rule did require ECP braking for the subset of rail cars that would still be classified as “high-hazard flammable trains” — an important step in pushing the rail industry to expand its use of the braking technology. Though the rule was limited in scope industry groups nonetheless lambasted the ECP braking requirements. “I have a hard time believing the determination to impose ECP brakes is anything but a rash rush to judgment” the president of the AAR said about the new rule. Obama-era regulators disagreed. “The mission of the FRA is safety and not focusing on what is convenient or inexpensive or provides the most cost savings for the rail industry” said Sarah Feinberg the FRA administrator at the time about the new rule. “When I focus on safety I land on ECP. It’s a very black-and-white issue for me.” Soon after the rule’s enactment the railroad industry took the matter to Congress and found allies in Senate Republicans after an election cycle that saw rail industry donors dump $6 million into GOP campaign coffers. Sen. John Thune (R-SD) — the Senate’s third largest recipient of rail industry campaign cash — pushed to repeal the electronic braking rule outright before settling for a measure requiring additional research and a new cost-benefit analysis of the technology. Under former president Donald Trump the braking upgrades quickly became another casualty of his administration’s slash-and-burn approach to regulatory policy. While the Obama administration had estimated that the rule could save more than $1 billion by averting accidents the Trump administration rolled out new figures that cut the estimated benefits by a third. While the Obama administration had estimated that the rule could save more than $1 billion by averting accidents the Trump administration rolled out new figures that cut the estimated benefits by a third. The AAR lobbying group concurred that “the costs of the ECP rule substantially outweigh its benefits” and claimed the mandate would cost them about $3 billion — or roughly two weeks of their operating revenue in a typical year. The FRA estimated the brake requirement would cost about half a billion. Trump’s Transportation Department ultimately rescinded the brake rule in late 2017. Thune praised the decision in a statement arguing that “sound science and careful study” had won the day. But a 2018 investigation from the Associated Press revealed that the Trump Transportation Department had flubbed its calculations. By excluding the most common type of train derailments the government’s analysis omitted at least $117 million in estimated future damages when it revised the rule’s potential benefits to justify its repeal. The agency acknowledged the error and issued a technical correction to its analysis but said that the expense was still too great to reinstate the ECP brake rule.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmF1ZGFjeS5jb20vOTI5dGhlZ2FtZS9zcG9ydHMvZ2VvcmdpYS1idWxsZG9ncy9zb3V0aGVybi1icmV3aW5nLXJlbGVhc2VzLWNoYW1waW9uc2hpcC1jb21tZW1vcmF0aXZlLWJlZXLSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southern Brewing releases championship-commemorative beer,"When a college football team wins a national championship parties are thrown parades are planned. When a team does it two years in a row like the Georgia Bulldogs just did with their 65-7 drubbing of TCU there are bigger parties and bigger parades.

And beers are created too to celebrate the moment. That is exactly what Athens brewery Southern Brewing Company did when they released Back 2 Back.

Southern Brewing's history supporting the Dawgs is steeped in tradition and they're more than just a brewery based in Athens. From their raspberry and blackberry Berliner Weisse called Red and Black to an IPA homage to Larry Munson called Hobnail to 7:00 AM a light American lager that's a nod to the time when campus tailgating opens on game day Southern Brewing Company lives UGA sports.

""We are a proud Athens Brewery and we are all fans of the program"" said the brewery's sales director Jay Harris. ""Yes we have a few beers that pay homage to UGA football and the university. We have utilized and worked with some of the schools like the Lamar Dodd Art School. They have helped us create our labels for our Double IPA series with a student spotlight on the can for them.""

Harris even said the brewery has gotten help from the Franklin School of Arts and Sciences to create local Georgia yeast strains found in their beers Cherokee Rose and Wild Azalea.

When the Dawgs started prepping for their second trip to the title game in as many years Southern Brewing started prepping too.

""We took a leap of faith and we were hopeful the Dawgs would win"" said Harris. ""So we brewed a 30-barrel batch of beer before the game and just waited to see the outcome and see what the reaction would be. To say the least it was overwhelming. We sold out instantly.""

That batch was just for Athens. Harris said they immediately brewed a 60-barrel batch to send out all over Georgia and another 30-barrel batch for the Athens faithful. Back 2 Back will hit stores outside of Athens on Monday Feb. 6. Harris described the beer as ""light and hazy. Hazy IPAs are very popular so this beer will have a tropical fruit tone on the nose and a nice pineapple-mango kick on the palette.""

As for the name the brewery had to take another leap of faith. Southern Brewing ordered labels for the beer cans more than a week prior to the national championship. Then they hatched a plan for an outstanding social media post and got some unplanned help for a Hollywood superstar.

""Our Athens sales rep Chad Cheely is the company’s biggest Dawg fan so of course he made the trip to Los Angeles for the game"" said Harris. ""The idea was to have him bring an empty can of the beer into the game to get an epic photo for our social media. The picture was epic and one of our most popular posts in almost eight years of being in business. The Samuel L. Jackson tweet was just too perfect to not feature on our photo so we worked it in.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNubi5jb20vMjAyMy8wMi8wNC91cy9lYXN0LXBhbGVzdGluZS1vaGlvLXRyYWluLWRlcmFpbG1lbnQtZmlyZS9pbmRleC5odG1s0gFPaHR0cHM6Ly9hbXAuY25uLmNvbS9jbm4vMjAyMy8wMi8wNC91cy9lYXN0LXBhbGVzdGluZS1vaGlvLXRyYWluLWRlcmFpbG1lbnQtZmlyZQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Train derailment in northeastern Ohio sparks massive fire,"CNN —

Evacuation and shelter-in-place orders remain in effect in a northeastern Ohio town after a train derailment sparked a massive fire and concerns about air quality.

A Norfolk Southern train with more than 100 cars derailed in East Palestine about 15 miles south of Youngstown according to the National Transportation Safety Board.

There were 20 cars with hazardous material in the train – 10 of which derailed. Of those 10 five were carrying vinyl chloride the NTSB said Saturday night.

“We have not confirmed vinyl chloride has been released other than from the pressure release devices” the agency added.

NTSB board member Michael Graham said in a news conference earlier Saturday there was still an “active fire scene” and could not estimate when the flames would be put out.

The cause of the derailment was not known Saturday.

Investigators say the train had image and data recorders onboard. It will take four to six weeks for the NTSB to have a preliminary report on the accident Graham said.

No injuries were reported.

EPA: No harmful levels of compounds in air

One car released some of the vinyl chloride through a safety release valve Graham said. State environmental officials say they have not detected any harmful levels of the chemical in the community.

Exposure with vinyl chloride a colorless gas is associated with a higher risk of certain forms of cancer according to the federal government’s National Cancer Institute.

No harmful levels of compounds had been detected in the air as of Saturday evening a spokesperson with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency told CNN in an email.

“Ohio EPA will remain on site and air monitors will remain in place as long as necessary” Ohio EPA spokesperson James Lee said in a statement. “Ohio EPA has established containment to help limit any damage to local streams and rivers from water runoff from the firefighting.”

The agency will work with local officials and the railroad company to “identify the nature and extent” of any possible contamination and will work to ensure cleanup efforts to protect human health and the environment Lee said.

Evacuation order remains in effect

Officials issued a shelter-in-place order for the entire town of roughly 5000 people while an evacuation order was in effect within a mile of the train crossing at James Street as of early Saturday. Conaway said he did not know when those orders would be lifted.

Two evacuation stations have opened to provide shelter to residents and the Red Cross has been notified Trent Conaway the mayor of East Palestine said.

Conaway on Saturday called for the “exercise of all necessary emergency authority for protection of lives and the property of the residents of the Village of East Palestine Ohio.”

The proclamation also called on citizens to comply with the emergency measures.

Traci Spratt the interim manager of the village of East Palestine said late Saturday the one-mile radius evacuation order from the incident remained in place “until further notice” and stressed “We need everyone to stay away from the scene.”

Spratt also said officials were conducting “continuous air monitoring and have found zero health risks.”

“The village’s drinking water is safe to drink and is being continually monitored” Spratt added.

Photos from the scene showed a large dense cloud of smoke engulfing flames atop the train. Firefighters from three states Pennsylvania Ohio and West Virginia responded according to Conaway.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Saturday he was briefed on the derailment and state authorities were “prepared to help our neighbors.”

The Norfolk Southern train departed from Madison Illinois and was bound for Conway Pennsylvania when it derailed according to the NTSB.

Norfolk Southern Railway said in a statement its team members were at the scene and added it was “coordinating with federal state and local agencies.”

The company said it set up a family assistance center “to address the needs of the community and support those directly impacted.”

“Additionally we are supporting the efforts of the American Red Cross and their temporary community shelters through a $25000 donation” the company said.

AMC's development of the technological capability to prospect explore and extract the resources of asteroids and cis-lunar space is well underway with the development of Space Capable Asteroid Robotic Explorers (SCAR-E) a modular hexapedal robotics platform.

For the past two years AMC has partnered with Tohoku University Space Robotics Laboratory (SRL) and has assembled the first prototype of SCAR-E. This will be the first commercial robot intended for use in microgravity environments for taking core samples and conducting resources prospecting on a range of celestial bodies including the Moon Mars and asteroids.

SCAR-E robots were designed from the ground up to operate autonomously in hostile microgravity environments utilising legged gripping locomotion necessary for targeted assessments of resources samples from Near Earth Asteroids. SCAR-E's hexapedal design allows access to locations inaccessible to previous missions and its built-in universal attachment point enables precise delivery of a range of payloads to their desired location. With resources often found in inaccessible locations such as water ice at the bottom of lunar craters SCAR-E provides novel prospecting capabilities for the space resources industry. The same gripping capabilities will enable SCAR-E to manoeuvre on the exteriors of orbital infrastructure such as space stations saving millions by carrying out activities which would otherwise require an Extra Vehicular Activity (spacewalk).

In order to take advantage of the favourable regulatory environment the relative abundance of space sector funding and to make inroads with partners within the launch and space services industry AMC has established its first international subsidiary in America.

Story continues

Asteroid Mining Corporation is also launching a series A round of fundraising. ""Starting from February 2023 we're looking for investors that can join us in our efforts to commercialise SCAR-E both terrestrially and in space depending on the use case"" said Mitch Hunter-Scullion AMC CEO.

SCAR-E's gripping technology allows for vertical mobility on a range of surfaces giving it a wide range of applications in terrestrial infrastructure inspection. It is particularly useful for jobs which fall under the 4 'D's - Dull Dirty Distant and Dangerous - as a way to reduce costs while increasing worker safety in critical sectors like energy and mining sectors.

About Asteroid Mining Corporation

AMC founded in 2016 is the UK's first space mining enterprise an aerospace company on a mission to exploit the potential of an off-Earth commercial market. Currently focussed on the prospecting and exploration stages it ultimately aims to extract process and utilise the materials embedded within some of the millions of Near Earth and Main Belt Asteroids.

The incident occurred at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport Saturday morning after an air traffic controller cleared a Boeing 737 operated by Southwest Airlines to depart according to the Federal Aviation Administration. However a Boeing 767 cargo plane operated by FedEx was also cleared to land when it was ""several miles from the airport.""

""Shortly before the FedEx aircraft was due to land the controller cleared Southwest Flight 708 to depart from the same runway"" said the FAA. ""The pilot of the FedEx airplane discontinued the landing and initiated a climb out.""

The National Transportation Safety Board called the incident in a tweet a ""possible runway incursion and overflight.""

Flight data from Flightradar24 shows the two planes coming close on the runway.

The FAA and NTSB said they are investigating the incident.

FedEx said in a statement to USA TODAY that its cargo plane arriving from Memphis landed safely at the airport ""after encountering an event."" The Southwest Airlines flight left Austin 15 minutes after its scheduled departure but arrived to its destination in Cancun Mexico early according to FlightAware data.

Southwest Airlines and FedEx referred questions to federal officials.

The close call comes after a similar incident occurred at John F. Kennedy International Airport in January. A preliminary investigation from the FAA found a Delta Air Lines had stop its takeoff roll after an American Airlines flight had crossed the runway from an adjacent taxiway. Days after the near-collision a JetBlue plane struck the tail of a parked aircraft at the same airport.

Citing unfair working conditions being overworked and understaffed unfair scheduling and the removal of their pride flag workers say they are organizing for a seat at the bargaining table and for workplace democracy. Workers are fighting to become the tenth unionized Starbucks in Ohio among the hundreds of stores across the country.

Starbucks workers have become one of the faces of the growing labor wave sweeping the United States currently. Beginning in New York state in 2021 the campaign now boasts over 270 unionized locations with over 7000 workers. The Starbucks corporation has since launched a brutal anti-union campaign against workers registering more than 1200 labor law violations and over 60 National Labor Relations Board complaints. Despite the pressures placed on them workers have continued to fight for their rights and for a better workplace. Following on the heels of the third Columbus location’s victory workers at West 5th filed on Jan. 28.

In their letter to CEO and board member Howard Schultz the West 5th Ave Partners as Starbucks calls their employees write that they “come together across a diverse workforce of parents and students cis and trans people of different abilities and ethnicities to advance [their] need of having a seat at the table in order to preserve and improve [their] store.” West 5th workers explain that as those who run the floor and make the company profit they demand a say in their working conditions.

Akeylah a trainer who supports the union said that she hopes “talks around unionizing elicit more transparency about pay a greater diligence to physical store conditions a better system for distributing partners who get displaced while waiting for their store to be remodeled more support for partners working during the slow holiday season more robust and comprehensive health care and incentives for shift supervisors and baristas who work hard to meet store metrics but rarely see the pay off.” Other demands stated in their letter include consistency and fairness in their scheduling employee-led meetings higher wages reflective of the growing cost of living in a developing city like Columbus open access to store information such as profit and labor budgeting job security and stability and the right to collectively bargain among others.

One partner named Julia elaborated that the process of unionizing would bring their store together in improving the environment and understanding each other more than ever before. She explained “As a partner that has been at West 5th for over a year now many of my coworkers are more than just partners to me they are my friends. These people are important to me and together we are important to our community. I will stand together with them to ensure that we all receive safe working conditions and fair wages that support the many different lifestyles that we lead.” Julia alongside 16 other partners signed the letter addressed to Howard Schultz.

As the latest labor organizing wave has swept the country these partners see themselves as part of the greater movement. Alongside the three other locations over the past year Columbus has seen other workers assert their strength such as the victory of the Columbus City School teachers strike.

Krystal another Partner at West 5th who supports unionizing noted that “a whole generation of young people is realizing that we are stronger together and have to make a stand to improve this world we share. One part of that is recognizing and building workers up both at an individual workplace level as well as a societal one.”

Organizing under the Chicago-Midwest Regional Joint Board of Workers United workers at West 5th are awaiting an election date that they hope will secure their victory and assert their strength as those workers who make the world run. As they finish in their letter to Howard Schultz “if Starbucks wants to call us Partners then we should be treated like those in a true partnership: as equals.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhc3Rpbmd0YWJsZS5jb20vMTE4MzY4Mi9yZXZpZXctdGhlLXN0YXJidWNrcy1nbGF6ZWQtZG91Z2hudXQtaXMtYS13b3J0aHkta3Jpc3B5LWtyZW1lLWFsdGVybmF0aXZlL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Review: The Starbucks Glazed Doughnut Is A Worthy Krispy Kreme Alternative,"Review: The Starbucks Glazed Doughnut Is A Worthy Krispy Kreme Alternative

It's pretty safe to say that Starbucks is not a doughnut shop. You might walk in and order a dozen coffees for the office but you likely won't be asking for a dozen doughnuts to go along with it. You might not even know it sells doughnuts! But the chain has made several changes over the years and we're not just talking about the expansions in its holiday drink menu. Starbucks began selling food in 2003 and the offerings have grown into a substantial list over the years. Today there are several choices to satiate your appetite as you get your daily dose of caffeine and food represented nearly 18% of Starbucks' first-quarter revenue in 2022 (via Business Quaint).

The egg sandwiches are the most beloved breakfast items according to Starbucks regulars but we've always had a sweet spot for the bakery items. Alongside the bagels lemon loaf and croissants is a single doughnut offering — an old-fashioned cake variety glazed with sweet icing. We wondered how it would stack up next to Krispy Kreme's iconic glazed pastries so we picked up a few and tested the sugary waters.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8va2ZveHR2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2Nhci1jcmFzaGVzLXRocm91Z2gtdGhlLWZyb250LW9mLXN0YXJidWNrcy1pbi1ub3J0aGVhc3QtbWFydGluLWx1dGhlci1raW5nLWpyLdIBamh0dHBzOi8va2ZveHR2LmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9jYXItY3Jhc2hlcy10aHJvdWdoLXRoZS1mcm9udC1vZi1zdGFyYnVja3MtaW4tbm9ydGhlYXN0LW1hcnRpbi1sdXRoZXIta2luZy1qci0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Car crashes through the front of Starbucks in northeast El Paso,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8va2ZveHR2LmNvbS9uZXdzL2Nhci1jcmFzaGVzLXRocm91Z2gtdGhlLWZyb250LW9mLXN0YXJidWNrcy1pbi1ub3J0aGVhc3QtbWFydGluLWx1dGhlci1raW5nLWpyLdIBamh0dHBzOi8va2ZveHR2LmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9jYXItY3Jhc2hlcy10aHJvdWdoLXRoZS1mcm9udC1vZi1zdGFyYnVja3MtaW4tbm9ydGhlYXN0LW1hcnRpbi1sdXRoZXIta2luZy1qci0?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025626E24250>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

In a video with over 758000 views as of Sunday TikTok user TJ (@fakery.joyner) explains her situation.

“I gotta say congratulations Starbucks on wasting my time for an entire month out of the year because after playing Starbucks for Life for 5 times a day for over a month I couldn’t even win an ornament or a tote from a multi-billion dollar company” she says. “Stop. It’s annoying.”

In the comments section many users claimed they faced similar issues playing the Starbucks for Life game.

“I have one left on each category. Now I just get not a winner” a user wrote.

“Have one left in about every category now I’m getting ‘sorry not a winner’ message” added another. “Can’t even get $1 off a handcrafted drink.”

“This game was a total disaster. I usually win something coffee stars. But NOPE Nothing” a third alleged.

These commenters share a similar complaint to another TikTok user who went viral late last year after digging into the terms and conditions for the game.

In short to get one of the prizes one must get all three Game Pieces for that item. However the probability of getting the first two Game Pieces is significantly higher than getting the final piece.

Per the terms “Two (2) of the three (3) Game Pieces for each Prize Type will be awarded regularly to Entrants. However there will be a limited number of the third Game Pieces for each Prize Type (“Rare Game Piece”) …”

This means getting the first two pieces in each row is easy while there are a severely limited amount of third pieces.

On TikTok users called out Starbucks’ perceived stinginess.

“They really couldn’t do 50% off a drink? They just raised prices again in my area so $1 is nothing” wrote a user in response to a comment about not even getting the $1-off prize.

“Like fr fr like not even a free pastry???” questioned a second.

We’ve reached out to TJ via TikTok comment and Starbucks via email."

The distributer of contact lenses and other medical goods is constructing a nearly $3 million addition to its headquarters operation at 35263 W. State St. in the Town of Burlington.

Company officials also have approached the City of Burlington about plans for creating a new warehouse in the old Richter’s Marketplace grocery store located two miles away in the city.

Wisconsin Vision Associates representatives could not be reached for comment about either project but local officials familiar with the company’s addition and warehouse plan said the medical goods supplier is carving out space for continuing growth of its sales and distribution business.

The company now describes itself as “the nation’s largest independent and doctor-owned contact lens distributor.”

Julie Anderson director of public works and development services for Racine County said the estimated 12000-square-foot expansion on State Street is designed primarily for more storage of inventory.

“The market for this company has expanded rapidly and they need more space” Anderson said.

The county approved a conditional use permit in 2013 when Wisconsin Vision moved to the Town of Burlington site. And county officials have since reviewed the company’s expansion plan.

Work in progress on the expansion was visible this week to motorists passing the company’s 26-acre campus along State Street just west of Burlington’s city limits.

The company has estimated the addition’s cost at $2.75 million.

Burlington town officials approved a building permit allowing the expansion to get started under contractor PSG Construction Inc.

Town Administrator Rachel Naber said she welcomes growth of the family-owned Wisconsin Vision Associates and she hopes it means that CEO Christopher Fait and his family soon will be hiring more people too.

“It’s nice to see local people investing into our town” Naber said.

Founded in the 1980s by Fait’s parents Robert Fait and Judy Fait Wisconsin Vision warehouses and distributes contact lenses and other optical goods for doctors.

The company operated for many years at 139 W. Chestnut St. in the City of Burlington but built its new facility starting in 2013 and relocated to the town two years later.

The estimated 70000-square-foot complex cost $7 million to construct.

At the time the medical goods operation had 154 employees with plans to add 30 more.

Wisconsin Vision quickly outgrew its new home and the company in 2020 disclosed plans to purchase the Pinecrest Shopping Center and transform the old Richter’s Marketplace into a warehouse.

The grocery store 156 S. Pine St. closed in 2019 and had been vacant ever since. It represented about half of the 102000-square-foot shopping center which was built in the 1960s.

Burlington city officials approved rezoning for the old grocery store site at Wisconsin Vision’s request. But the company never publicly announced more about its Pine Street plans until recently.

Gregory Guidry building inspector for the City of Burlington said company officials presented tentative plans for the former grocery store property about two weeks ago.

“They’re just now starting to move forward” Guidry said.

The plans call for transforming Richter’s Marketplace in three phases. A building permit will be required but no permit application has been submitted yet.

“It’s going to be a huge warehouse distribution center” Guidry said.

On its Facebook page Wisconsin Vision last month posted an upbeat assessment about the company’s growth during 2022.

“This year our team has shown tremendous amounts of positivity support and dedication that has contributed to our successes and achievements” the message stated. “Our people are our greatest asset and we wouldn’t be here without them.”

The Hoosier State maintained its spot as the top steel producer nationally. It has made more steel than any other state for more than four decades said Lisa Harrison senior vice president of communications for the American Iron and Steel Institute.

“Over the past 12 months ending in November 2022 Indiana produced about 21.5 million tons of steel” she said. “That’s about 12% less than the previous year.”

Indiana made 24.3 million tons of steel in 2021 and 21.6 million tons in 2020.

Last year the Hoosier State made more than twice as much steel as the second-place state Ohio.

“The second-largest steel producer over the past 12 months Ohio produced about 10.5 million tons of steel” Harrison said.

Much of the steel made in Indiana takes place at the gargantuan integrated steel mills that ring Lake Michigan’s South Shore in the Region. Cleveland-Cliffs and U.S. Steel’s mills in Northwest Indiana are some of the largest in the world.

Parking lots the size of football fields are filled with steel coil at the mills along the lakeshore. Trains and trucks constantly rumble through carrying the gleaming steel coil to far-flung factories to be made into cars appliances building materials and countless other products.

While steelmaking in America has long been transitioning to smaller lower-cost mini-mills Lake and Porter counties account for about half the blast-furnace capacity in the country.

The steel industry pervades Northwest Indiana where NLMK Indiana and many other steel companies operate out of the Port of Indiana-Burns Harbor for instance. The Region is home to many steel service centers and distributors: Berlin Metals Munster Steel Ryerson Republic Steel Alliance Steel AAA Supply Corp. Kenwai Steel Ratner Steel Supplies Crossroads Steel Supply Adriatic Steel Co. Leeco Steel Bayshore Metal Serve Steel Coltrade Inc. RW Conklin Steel Supply Steel Cities Steels Chicago Specialty Steels and Steel Supply Corp.

It’s also home to many companies that service the steel industry such as TMS International and Praxair.

Indiana is also home to Steel Dynamics in Fort Wayne and a Nucor mini-mill in Crawfordsville.

The Hoosier State has led the nation in steel production since at least 1975 according to the American Iron and Steel Institute.

Steelmaking was long spread out more across the nation with steel mills scattered across Pennsylvania Maryland Michigan and many other places. But the U.S. steel industry suffered significant decline during the 1970s when foreign competitors flooded the country with cheap imports turning many mill towns into gutted ghost towns with great industrial ruins just rusting away.

Much of America’s steelmaking production ended up consolidated in Northwest Indiana. It’s a strategic location because of “proximity to Lake Michigan and easier to access raw materials needed for steelmaking delivered on lake freighters” Harrison said.

Northwest Indiana steel mills can more easily procure iron ore from Minnesota’s Iron Range and northern Michigan. They’re also close to many of the largest users of steel: automotive plants in Michigan Ohio Kentucky and downstate Indiana.

Last year Indiana single-handedly accounted for about 24% of the nation’s steel production. The American Iron and Steel Institute estimates that U.S. steel mills shipped 89 million tons of steel nationwide down from 94.5 million tons the previous year.

Indiana’s steel production remains below pre-pandemic levels however. The state made 24.7 million tons of steel in 2019 but Cleveland-Cliffs and U.S. Steel have idled blast furnaces since then. U.S. Steel also has idled much of its tin production in Northwest Indiana citing declining demand.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvczQxNTk4LTAyMy0yOTA5Ny040gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Incentive strategy of safe and intelligent production in assembled steel plants from the perspective of evolutionary ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='idp.nature.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /authorize?response_type=cookie&client_id=grover&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41598-023-29097-8 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002562F424AF0>, 'Connection to idp.nature.com timed out.

Berry famously cursed out Singer on set one day and told him to ""kiss my Black ass.""Singer's haphazard behaviour often led to scenes being rewritten on the spot.""One of his great things was that when he came to a new set he would have to rethink it. He'd have a thought and then have to rethink [the scene]. So that was always a difficult transition for him. But once he cracked it he cracked it very quickly and was able to get on with it"" Cox said.""I think he's an extraordinary director really really gifted. Certainly I will always be grateful to him because he had confidence in me and got me the role. I played a waiting game and it worked"" he added.The source reported that last month Hugh Jackman  who played Wolverine in the franchise was asked whether Singer's alleged behaviour and misconduct tainted the legacy of the 'X-Men' franchise.Replying to this the actor answered ""You know that's a really really complicated question. There's a lot of things at stake there. 'X-Men' was the turning point I believe in terms of comic-book movies and I think there's a lot to be proud of.""Meanwhile Cox currently starts on HBO's Emmy winner 'Succession' which is returning for its fourth season in March as per source.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjaG9saXZlLmllL2NvcmtuZXdzL2FyaWQtNDEwNjQyMzYuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cork Chamber call for renewed focus on infrastructure and housing to unlock county's potential,"DELIVERY on housing and transport infrastructure is key for Cork to reach its true potential Cork Chamber president Ronan Murray has said.

Speaking at the Chamber’s annual dinner last night Mr Murray said that he believes Cork is “on the cusp of fulfilling its true potential” with the catalyst for success being “continued focus on key infrastructure delivery”.

Mr Murray called for renewed focus on delivery of the Cork to Limerick and Ringaskiddy motorways.

“After the successful opening of the Macroom bypass late last year we should renew our focus on the Cork to Limerick and Ringaskiddy motorways in particular” he said.

“The M28 is key to our port becoming a global hub and of course to unlocking the docklands for housing development.

“This continued focus on key infrastructure delivery will provide a catalyst to ensure our city is poised to capitalise on the growth opportunities that exist in the years ahead.”

He also said the Chamber must work with elected representatives on the “delivery of high-quality high-density apartments in the city centre and docklands as well as the electrification of our suburban rail network”.

The Chamber president said that 2023 “is a year of opportunity for Cork” emphasising that innovation will be key to success for the county.

“In the world we now live in the pace of change is increasing” he said. “Technology and geopolitics are reshaping the global economy the Irish economy and indeed our own city. In this new environment we have shown an outstanding ability to adapt and succeed but to continue to do so we must constantly innovate and continue to challenge ourselves.

“Everyone in this room has a pivotal role to play in continuing that drive towards innovation and entrepreneurism — this will be key to our future success … Cork must continue to be a hub of fresh thinking. In this new modern era innovation is not just for business it is for society as a whole as we address the various challenges that will define this decade.”

Mr Murray said innovation is evident amongst the stories of finalists in the Cork Chamber Company of the Year Awards “where each company sought to make a difference in their respective industries”.

Company of the Year Awards

At the ceremony Cork Chamber announced Stryker as the overall winner of the Cork Company of the Year Awards 2023.

As the leading business organisation in the south of Ireland Cork Chamber supports and represents the interests of almost 1200 businesses employing more than 100000 people across the region.

Now in their 25th year the awards in association with Vodafone Ireland and media partner the Irish Examiner recognise the diversity and vibrancy that exists in the Cork business community.

Overall winner Stryker also won in the International Company category while winners of the other three categories were LegitFit for Emerging Cork Company of the Year M&P O’ Sullivan for SME Cork Company of the Year and Amarenco for Large Cork Company of the Year.

Mr Murray said Stryker’s Cork campus is “a key contributor to their innovative offering of products and services that impact over 100m patients worldwide every year”.

“Not only have they grown their product portfolio to become one of the world’s leading medical technology companies but they have also contributed hugely to the Cork economy.

“They recently invested $300m in their Carrigtwohill facility creating capacity for an additional 600 new jobs.”

Accepting the award Bernard O’Connor Stryker vice-president of advanced operations and global additive technologies said the company is proud of its success in Cork.

“Stryker’s story in Cork began with 20 people in 1998 — 25 years later we now employ over 4000 people across six sites” he said.

“Stryker benefits from the talent pool in Cork and works closely with our education and business partners to drive a programme of lifelong learning

There were four individual category awards presented at the ceremony which took place in City Hall.

One of the great features that we get is the ability to use an HTML5 iKVM instead of using Java. For all of those admins who had to work through Java prompts for years just to get an iKVM session going HTML5 is simply awesome. In the newer X12 X13 H12 H13 and later generations of systems Supermicro made a change to how remote mounting media works. That means it is time for a quick guide.

How to Add Virtual Media to a Supermicro Server via HTML5 iKVM Web IPMI Interface

If you log into a newer Supermicro server’s IPMI management interface and open the HTML5 iKVM you will see something like this:

The “Virtual Media” menu item that we are familiar with from the Java version is there but it is not available. Supermicro’s newer servers do not let you use this function on the HTML5 browser without a license. It usually still works on the Java browser but the whole point is not to have to use Java. In the newer version of the IPMI firmware you may see this layout instead:

We have an easy and a hard way to get it working. The easy way is to buy SFT-DCMS-SINGLE and then apply the license file. That will allow you to do a traditional virtual media mounting via the browser.

If you have a single server this is a $130-200 license that adds other features but it is the easiest way to get that HTML5 Virtual Media working.

The less expensive way is to mount over a network share. Here we have a QNAP NAS that we have an isos share available. This network share needs to be available from the management network. The below look at the directory is being viewed from a Windows PC with the network share mounted.

On the Supermicro IPMI web interface you will want to navigate to Configuration then Virtual Media on the left-hand menu.

There the two required fields are the host and the path. On the hostname if your NAS has a DNS name of “nas123456” for example you cannot just put “nas123456” in the share host field.

Since one sees “domain” for the field another option one may think of is using a https server with ISO images. That requires a SFT-DCMS-SINGLE or SFT-OOB-LIC license.

That leaves us with an IP address and then a path.

So here we have:

Share Host – IP Address

Path to Image – path on the network share. In this case it is “\isos\ubuntu-20.04.5-live-server-amd64.iso”. Note here if you try “/isos/ubuntu-22.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso” because that is the directory when you are going through the share on linux or “\\isos\ubuntu-22.04.1-live-server-amd64.iso” those will not work. Be careful with the “\”.

Users – This is a username if the share requires it

Password – This is the password if the share requires it. Note there are some characters that you cannot use for example the “?” here. So if the network share by chance has a “?” is the password the Supermicro IPMI will not accept this.

Once that is set the ISO can be mounted using the mount button at the bottom.

Once that is done you should see the ISO mounted up top under “Device 1”.

At that point you can install the OS or drivers as needed.

How to Unmount a Supermicro Virtual Disk

If you want to unmount a Supermicro virtual disk then you will go under Device 1 (pictured below) and on the right side there is a disk with a red “x” image. Click on that and you will get this dialog.

After that the disk should be unmounted. If you forget this step then the system might continue to boot from the virtual media ISO.

BONUS: Supermicro IPMIview 2.0 Works in the Opposite Manner Without Installing Java

Many at STH know we have been using IPMIview 2.0 for a long time. The IPMIview 2.0 program has been one that is known to let you run the Java iKVM client without installing Java and keeping that up-to-date. Given what we showed above many will be surprised to find that IPMIview 2.0 works almost in an opposite way. The Virtual CD-ROM with IPMIview 2.0 requires a license (SFT-DCMS-SINGLE or SFT-OOB-LIC):

However if you utilize the OpenJDK viewer then you can get the remote iKVM and also select virtual media and mount a drive remotely using this.

If you want to mount a local ISO to Supermicro IPMI and do not have a network share reachable by the hosts and do not have a license then using IPMIview 2.0 will allow you to get your job done without a license.

Final Words

It is too bad that this feature is being taken away and hidden behind a paywall with the HTML5 viewer. It is one that previously set Supermicro apart from Dell HPE and Lenovo. While having the current functionality is OK the price point of $130-$200 to get the feature SFT-DCMS-SINGLE for the HTML5 iKVM virtual media feels like a lot if you are not using other features. At least there are alternatives available. Usually we pay $50-75 for a USB drive to get mounted to a server with remote hands in a data center so that is another option if the server’s USB ports are enabled.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Agents from various law enforcement groups were in attendance including Homeland Security Cook County Sheriff’s Office the Internal Revenue Service Illinois Attorney General’s Office US Postal Inspectors and Chicago PD among many others. Retailers were also well represented from big box department store and specialty ORC team members. In all over 100 people attended the meeting.

Hosts Dave Williams from the Illinois State Attorney’s office and Ed Hinkel from Walmart led the meeting and started off with two case profiles that resulted in the takedown of two criminal networks.

Synchrony Financial Representatives and Vice Presidents fo the Special Investigations Team Mark Solomon and Jeff Waterman presented a case from Chicago. They walked the group through an aggressive identity theft crime and provided tips on ways to obtain case information without the time and headache of a subpoena.

- Digital Partner -

Officers Jason Bromwich and Chris Fenton from the Chesterfield Missouri police department presented a case where the subject had mastered the art of using Facebook to market his ill gotten wares even going so far as to take orders through the app and set up a brick and mortar shop. He had been operating as the central hub for years in this manner. After navigating a somewhat complicated legal system of qualifying offences and serving a warrant on Facebook the officers partnered with retailers and Flock Safety to track and eventually apprehend the subject. The strong message from the officers to loss prevention teams is: “Help PD close these cases by calling the police doing your reports and providing video. You are the victims and we just want to help you.

Ken Velasquez CFI asset protection specialist with 7-11 spoke about their cooperation with law enforcement and ability to pull video when needed by using their highly efficient internal team. Ken encouraged those in attendance to reach out and 7-11 would be there to help.

The meeting wrapped up with a timely topic that the public is just becoming more familiar with. HSI Intelligence Analyst Cameron McDougal spoke about cryptocurrency and its use in money laundering by organized criminals. McDougal provided an overview of the history of cryptocurrency and educated the group on its current role in hiding illegal profits. As the criminal networks continue to evolve their methods so do law enforcement’s investigative techniques. McDougal walked those present through recent cases including the advanced software that was used to follow money through the labyrinth of the crypto banking system.

It’s been an exciting few years for Kansas City sports enthusiasts who year-round get to enjoy an abundance of teams and athletes to cheer at the professional and college level. And the town's many sports-friendly bars make it easy to find your fellow fans.

Whether you’re watching the Chiefs Royals Current Jayhawks or even the Olympics there are a few musts for any good sports bar: enough (and big!) television screens to catch the action from any angle great food and drinks to pass the time and an atmosphere of winners (even when your team isn’t doing great).

We asked local enthusiasts about their favorite sports bars in Kansas City and these spots took the crown.

Touchdown around town

Bek Shackelford-Nwanganga / KCUR 89.3 Kansas City Chiefs fan Marshon Stephenson celebrates at Gael's Public House & Sports.

Located in a 100-year-old building near UMKC and Rockhurst University Gael’s Public House touts 26 television screens three full-service bars and a hearty menu that includes pizza burgers shepherd’s pie and other pub fare. Quench your thirst with local craft beer and cider on tap wine and cocktails — including a wide array of non-alcoholic options.

Kevin Collins roots for University of Oregon’s football and basketball teams (go Ducks!) but he’s also a well-rounded fan of the Chiefs Royals and Sporting KC. For their atmosphere Collins enjoys The Granfalloon a sports bar staple on the Country Club Plaza since 1977 and Ugly Joe’s in South Kansas City.

Dedicated to “providing the best game day experience in town” Ugly Joe’s displays more than 30 high-definition big screen televisions including several 96-inchers. Guests can also entertain themselves with bar games such as Golden Tee machines and dart boards. Elsewhere Collins highlights Hi-Dive Loungeon W. 39th Street for the “great staff and Chiefs game atmosphere.”

Cassie Niemeyer pitches Midtown’s Tower Tavern “for all things soccer and its charred Buffalo wings.” Make it a goal to explore their Chicago-style Italian roast beef sandwich and stromboli options too.

For Sara Harper Johnny’s Tavernwas her pick “for watching sports because of their great food and service. If it’s hockey then I head to The Blue Line. I’m always rooting for the Chiefs KU basketball Wisconsin football Chicago Cubs baseball and Colorado Avalanche hockey.”

Kickoff Kansas City-style

Robert Hoops Kansas City Chiefs fans gather at Chappell's Restaurant & Sports Museum in North Kansas City.

Jesse Smith Ward 2 city council member in North Kansas City swings over to the original Chicken-n-Picklewhich “has tons of TVs and will often set up a private viewing room for bigger games or at the request of fans.”

Smith keeps up with March Madness college basketball the Georgia Bulldogs (“Go Dawgs”) the Atlanta Braves and the Chiefs. Plus as a World Cup watcher he’ll have plenty of games to enjoy when Kansas City is one of the 2026 host cities.

Speaking of March Madness the NCAA men’s basketball tournament is coming to Kansas City on March 24 and 26 at the T-Mobile Center downtown. The nearby Power & Light District is home to several sports bars such as Yard House Johnny’s Tavern and McFadden’s Sports Saloon (which celebrates its 15th anniversary on February 2). KC Live! also offers outdoor sports viewing for you and hundreds of your closest friends.

Bruce Smith catches soccer matches at Strange Days Brewing in the River Market. You can check online for upcoming viewings of Premier league and other European football events.

Former Kansas Citian-turned-Floridian Erica Williams favors The Peanut’s “really fun atmosphere for all sports” and Christine’s Firehouse for Chiefs games where “they have raffles during the games.” Located in North Kansas City Christine’s Firehouse is known for their pork tenderloin sandwiches.

Also in North Kansas City is Chappell’s Restaurant and Sports Museum a destination for sports memorabilia.

Longtime food and drink journalist Dave Eckert tees up Northland-based T-Shotz for “great views solid food and good booze” when he cheers for the Chiefs and the St. Louis Cardinals.

Even more neighborhood favorites

Kyle Palmer / KCUR 89.3 At The 403 Club bar patrons can play on an array of pin ball machines.

Ashlee Fairchild Jones likes the atmosphere at The 403 Club in Kansas City Kansas. Owned and operated by Artie Scholes the club is known for its craft beer selection array of top-condition pinball games and patio.

“There’s usually a fun spread of snacks and if you aren’t into the game or need to blow off some steam from a loss then you can play pinball” Fairchild says.

Bob Plagens a professional soccer fan and craft beer enthusiast admits that he “generally despises sports bars.” So he prefers to watch Bundesliga a German professional football league at Kansas City Bier Company Sporting KC away matches at Pathlight Brewing or River Bluff Brewing in the River Market.

Sometimes Plagens watches U.S. soccer matches at Johnny's Tavern: “That's where the supporters’ club has watch parties.”

Neighborhood sports bar Sully’s Pub in Mission Kansas serves cold beer in cold mason jars. Outside of the dozen televisions sports lovers can play skee ball foosball darts Pop-A-Shot shuffleboard and GoldenT.

Other neighborhood hotspots include Social in Waldo Brookside hangouts Charlie Hooper’s and The Brooksider Sportsbar and Grill and The Other Place in Downtown Overland Park.

Banned from using Google software and apps by the U.S. Commerce Department due to security issues Huawei developed its own operating system called HarmonyOS. It was first used on a Huawei smartphone with the Mate 40 series and the Mate X2 foldable. Eventually Huawei Mobile Services was also released in 2019 and includes the company's AppGallery app storefront.





Gizchina reports that according to an unnamed tech blogger Huawei is currently in the process of testing HarmonyOS 3.1 internally. Version 3.0 of the operating system was pre-installed on the Mate 50 line that was released to a warm reception domestically last year . The latest rumor says that the new build kills off some bugs while improving system stability. The report also says that Huawei doesn't have plans in place to update recently released handsets over the air with HarmonyOS 3.0.

With a 2% global market share HarmonyOS is the third-largest smartphone platform in the world



And it isn't too soon to be thinking about version 4.0 of HarmonyOS. The report says the operating system's next major build will include some new designs (we assume that the UI of the operating system is what will be changed) along with some new functionality. Now here's the deal folks while HarmonyOS-powered handsets make up only 2% of the world's smartphones that is good enough to make Huawei's in-house operating system the third largest smartphone platform in the world after Android and iOS.









In talking with our readers throughout the years some believe that Huawei deserves all of the punishments placed on it by the U.S. because the company is truly a national security threat. And there are others who believe that the U.S. started punishing Huawei only to make sure that it didn't negatively impact Apple's businesses. No matter what you believe the Chinese manufacturer may not have thrived as it did in the past but it didn't roll over and die either.





And Huawei's Mate 50 featured some innovations including the Emergency Battery Mode that even with 1% battery life remaining allowed users to make calls for 12 minutes send messages and stay on standby for up to three hours. The Mate 50 Pro became only the second handset to feature a camera with a variable aperture.







ne of the most interesting apps available from AppGallery is called Petal Search . The app allows users to obtain ""daily weather forecasts and top news; live sports scores and schedules; video image and music searches; and financial news and stock market updates."" If you're about to travel Petal Search will ""search millions of hotels worldwide and book rooms; and check flights and travel info for top global destinations."" Petal Search will also ""look up local services and businesses with comprehensive directories."" But there is even more functionality to this app.

The U.S. tightens the ban on chip shipments to Huawei







If you're looking for a particular app that isn't listed on AppGallery for one reason or another search for it on Petal Search and even apps developed by Americans will show up if they are available to be sideloaded from a third-party app store. If an alternative source for such an app is found you can install it directly from the Petal Search app. When we first wrote about the app three years ago it allowed Huawei device owners to install American-developed apps such as Amazon Snapchat Speedtest.net and AccuWeather.





Now that the U.S. has banned Huawei from receiving the 4G-only Snapdragon chipsets from Qualcomm the company's continued existence in the smartphone industry will depend on whether Huawei receives a patent for a new light source it created for the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines that are used to etch extremely thin circuitry patterns on silicon wafers. It is crucial to the production of cutting-edge chips. One Ditch company ASML makes these machines and is banned from shipping them to China.

Whatever turns out to be the U.S. market truth what's at stake is the future of the 100 million-plus households the company says share passwords more than 40% of the company's 231 million paid memberships. And beyond that how all of the media companies migrating the last generation of linear cable subscriptions to the internet handle a financial environment in which there is a more pressing need to generate returns on the high costs of streaming. The days of Netflix's Twitter account and HBO's former chief Richard Plepler saying a media company's primary goal was getting people ""addicted"" to streaming are over. Back in 2014 allowing people to share passwords was a ""terrific marketing vehicle for the next generation of viewers"" Plepler once told BuzzFeed. A decade later the next generation's time to pay has come.

It will soon become mostly a thing of the past if the world's largest streaming service has its way. After experimenting with a plan to crack down on password sharing in Latin America Netflix will launch the U.S. version of this subscription identification tracking technology in March but has been quiet on the details of how it will work. That is until earlier this week when a Netflix FAQ page change picked up on by the press indicated that any user watching from an account's non-""primary location"" could receive a temporary code to verify use for up to seven days maximum — to cover legitimate account user travel. But that FAQ page was later updated again to remove those details and the company told The Streamable  the first to identify the FAQ change it was a mistake and still only applied to the Latin American countries where Netflix has piloted the approach.

Netflix's terms of use limit sharing of passwords to people who live together in the same location indicating that college kids may not be allowed. There's a fine point here: College students often don't change their permanent address until after they graduate. Even two analysts who follow Netflix acknowledged that their college-aged children are piggybacking on the family Netflix account for now.

""I have a daughter in college in Florida who uses a TV to watch – that will cost I suspect $5 more per month"" said Rich Greenfield who follows Netflix for LightShed Partners. ""If she only watched on laptop or phone I suspect it would be no incremental cost. I suspect most parents will suck up the extra cost. Whereas friends and extended family will have to get their own accounts.""

""Almost everyone I know who password-shares it's with their families"" said Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter. ""My kids are in college so that's legit. I support them. She's part of my household. The day [my daughter] is on her own she can get her own password.""

Netflix spokeswoman Kumiko Hidaka declined to say how Netflix plans to address college students specifically. The company's terms of use require people to live at the same location to share a password.

In testing in Chile Costa Rica and Peru Netflix uses information such as IP addresses device IDs and account activity from devices signed into the Netflix account to identify persistent sharing outside of a household. The company's terms of use already require customers to agree to Netflix tracking this information in order to deliver the service.

In the U.S. where subscribers are allowed to use their subscriptions while traveling the service already uses similar methods to question whether subscribers signing on from hotels or Airbnbs are who they say they are. In cases like those the company will send the primary account holder a code that must be entered in order to go forward which is what the since-deleted FAQ page explained with the maximum request period for the temporary code set at seven days.

The quick solution to this for many password sharers is a quick text chain from the subscriber to the friend or child using the account. Kid tells mom and dad they're about to log on Netflix sends the code to the main account holder and the parents send it to the kid who enters it. Pachter said in an interview before the FAQ page update and deletion that Netflix could restrict this by imposing a short time limit on how fast the person trying to get onto the service could respond to the authentication effort. But the FAQ suggested the bigger time limit may be related to the maximum number of days that this can work.

Greenfield more than Pachter said that he expected Netflix to crack down on the college-age shared-password users. Netflix may use the college market as a key target for an extra-user plan which adds $2.99 a month to bills and is now offered in Costa Rica Peru and Chile for customers who want to add up to two friends or family members not living with them to their account.

The result could resemble the way Spotify works where cheap add-on plans are available or the forthcoming plan could resemble cell-phone plans that let friends and family bundle lines in exchange for lower rates.

""I don't think I'd pay $15 apiece"" Pachter said but he might absorb a lower rate into the family package. ""I'd tell them to figure it out with your roommate. But I'm not going to not pay $16.99 [for the family]. What am I going to do – save $4?""

The company ought to leave college students alone Pachter said and focus on getting them to sign up independently upon graduation.

Pachter also isn't a fan of the plan as it was briefly revealed which he said overlooks details about how many families use Netflix. The leaked method included a 31-day lapse for any device not logged on to a primary location's home network. But in his own home for example little-used TVs across many rooms might be challenged when guests or kids returning from college try to log them on.

""When Netflix blocks access to those devices at the same location it's going to annoy me"" Pachter said. ""Also this plan may backfire for paying customers who don't use the service for a few months. They could get blocked and decide it's easier to quit.'""

In Latin America users in nations where the password-sharing enforcement is being tested who don't qualify to be added as an extra member on an existing account can get their own for $8.99 a month. In the U.S. the cheapest option is the Basic with Ads plan introduced in November at $6.99 a month. The ad-supported plan isn't available in Peru Costa Rica or Chile yet.

Netflix announced this week several enhancements to its premium plan related to audio quality and download permissions across more devices.

Netflix's plan is likely to include cheap options to appeal to consumers who need ""a little bit of a nudge"" to set up their own account co-chief executive officer Greg Peters said in a Jan. 19 conference call.

""Part of it's just what we call casual sharing which is you know people could pay but you know they don't need to"" Peters said. ""And so they're borrowing somebody's account."""

New York CNN —

Meme stock mania was supposed to be over right? Guess what: It’s not.

Sure the entire market did well in January. But many of the Reddit/WallStreetBets darlings of two years ago were particularly strong performers.

Shares of movie theater chain AMC (AMC) have soared nearly 65% so far in 2023 and AMC (AMC)’s companion preferred stock (which trades under the ticker APE as a nod to the nickname AMC (AMC) fans have given themselves on social media) has more than doubled.

Meanwhile Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) has gained about 30% despite rumors of an imminent bankruptcy filing and more store closings. And shares of GameStop (GME) sort of the OG meme stock from 2021 are up more than 25% as well.

Speculative investors are going all-in on crypto too. With bitcoin rebounding from a 52-week low of about $15600 to a current level of just under $24000 Coinbase shares have skyrocketed an astonishing 140% since the end of 2022.

Then there’s Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation (ARKK) exchange-traded fund a poster child for speculative bets that owns Tesla (TSLA) Zoom (ZM) Roku (ROKU) and Coinbase among its top holdings. This ETF has had an incredible start to 2023 surging more than 40%.

Market history repeating itself?

So did investors learn nothing from last year’s market meltdown? I wrote last week about how one strategist dubbed this year’s market madness as a “flight to crap.”

Others are a little less critical of the so-called junk stock rally but they are still worried this won’t end well.

“I’m concerned generally. I don’t agree with this market rally in meme stocks” said Erik Ristuben chief investment strategist with Russell Investments.

Ristuben said he still thinks odds are greater than 50-50 that the economy is heading toward recession. If that happens lower-quality stocks should get hit hard.

Another strategist agrees this recent rally for meme stocks and other speculative bets may not end well.

“At the start of every year you typically see a mean reversion. The stocks that went down a lot at the end of the previous year get bought” said Michael Sheldon chief investment officer with RDM Financial Group at Hightower. “But this year’s sharp rally and rebound in beaten down names has been an extreme example of that.”

The trouble with meme stocks and other speculative companies is that they are often struggling to sustainably make money. They are story-driven companies rather than businesses that have solid earnings and cash flows.

GameStop for example posted a net loss of $95 million in the third quarter of 2022. AMC reported a loss of about $227 million.

“Investors should not ignore the fact that owning an unprofitable company and hoping it eventually makes money is expensive” said Ronald Temple chief market strategist with Lazard. “The markets are excessively exuberant.”

Temple worries that investors are once again getting swept up by momentum and aren’t stopping to think about how much risk they are taking on with meme stocks.

“There is a little bit of a fear of missing out” Temple said. “That partly explains the lower quality aspect of this rally.”

Consumer comeback?

Of course many companies are actually profitable. And investors will be preparing for another torrent of corporate earnings reports this week.

Big banks oil giants and tech titans have led the earnings parade so far. But now consumer companies get ready for their closeup.

Among the many retail restaurant and entertainment companies on tap to report their latest results: CVS (CVS) Yum Brands (YUM) (owner of KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell) Chipotle (CMG) Disney (DIS) Tapestry (TPR) (parent of Coach and Kate Spade) Mattel (MAT) and Pepsi (PEP).

Recession worries and inflation jitters hurt consumer stocks in 2022. But some Wall Street experts think these companies are due for a major comeback this year as pricing pressures fade.

“Inflation is slowing sharply” said strategists at Evercore ISI in a recent report. They upgraded their outlook on consumer discretionary stocks saying the sector “has once again taken up its traditional ‘worst to first’ role.”

“Consumer Discretionary has a proven track record of outperformance even if growth is subpar in 2023; the key is that while the inflation remains high the trend of inflation is demonstrably falling” the Evercore ISI strategists said.

So investors will be listening closely to what executives at big consumer oriented firms have to say in earnings conference calls with analysts about the outlook for 2023. If they’re upbeat about spending that could keep the rally in consumer stocks going.

The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) ETF has soared almost 20% so far this year.

The Austin Texas electric vehicle company bumped up the price of the Model Y Long Range version by about 2% to $54990 and the Performance version by about 2.7% to $57990 according to its website. The prices exclude shipping and an order fee.

The moves made Friday come three weeks after Tesla cut prices nearly 20% on some versions of the Model Y the company’s top-selling vehicle. The price cuts were made to boost sagging demand and also to make more versions of the Model Y eligible for the $7500 electric-vehicle tax credit in the Inflation Reduction Act. The full tax credits will be available at least into March.

On Friday The Treasury Department revised vehicle classification definitions to make more EVs — including SUVs made by Tesla Ford and General Motors — eligible the full $7500.

The change came after lobbying by automakers that had pressed the Biden administration to change vehicle definitions to allow higher priced vehicles to qualify for a maximum credit. Tesla CEO Elon Musk met with top aides to President Joe Biden last week to discuss the EV industry and the broader goals of electrification.

Under the sweeping law approved last summer pickup trucks SUVs and vans with a sticker price up to $80000 qualify for EV tax credits while new electric cars sedans and wagons can only be priced up to $55000. The rule had disqualified some higher-priced SUVs such as GM’s Cadillac Lyriq and some versions of the Model Y prompting complaints from Tesla and other automakers.

The January price cuts apparently worked. On Tesla’s earnings conference call last week CEO Elon Musk said that so far in January the company had seen the strongest number of orders year-to-date in company history. He also said the company had raised the Model Y price “a little bit in response to that.”

After Tesla’s price cuts Ford responded by reducing the price of its Mustang Mach-E in part to qualify for the tax credit and also to spur buyer interest. But crosstown rival General Motors said it had no plans to cut EV prices.

The EV tax credits are among a host of changes enacted in the Inflation Reduction Act which Congress approved in August with only Democratic votes. The law is designed to spur EV sales as part of a broader effort to reduce planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions.

But a complex web of requirements including where vehicles and batteries must be manufactured to qualify has cast doubt on whether buyers can receive the full $7500 credit.

The Treasury Department said Friday that it hopes to make it easier for consumers to know which vehicles qualify for the credit. Under the revised rule vehicle classifications will be determined by a consumer-facing fuel economy labeling standard rather than a more complicated formula set by the Environmental Protection Agency Treasury said.

A message was left Saturday seeking comment from Tesla on the price increases.

Fresh-frozen or FFPE brain and/or spinal cord samples from 29 cats fulfilling the inclusion criteria for this study (multifocal lymphohistiocytic meningoencephalomyelitis or meningoencephalitis—if spinal cord was not available for analysis—with predominance in the grey matter of unknown cause in combination with clinical signs compatible with the description of ‘staggering disease’ particularly ataxia and other gait disturbances) were provided by different laboratories from Sweden Austria and Germany (Table 1; Fig. 2; Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Exclusion criteria were inflammatory changes predominantly affecting the white matter as well as extensive degenerative grey and white matter lesions. The samples dated back to 1991 to 1993 (Austria) or 2017 to 2022 (Germany and Sweden). Some of these cases had been published previously61112. In addition frozen brain samples from 21 cats originating from Sweden Austria and Germany without encephalitis were included as controls. An additional control group was composed of frozen or FFPE brain samples from eight cats from Germany that had suffered from encephalitis of other types or causes such as CNS manifestation of feline coronavirus (FCoV)-associated feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) vasculitic disorders of suspected hypertensive background and immune-mediated limbic encephalitis (Table 1; Supplementary Table 4)6. Metadata were provided by the submitters and/or extracted from the previous publications including course and duration of disease age sex origin and outdoor access of the cats (Supplementary Tables 2 and 4) as well as clinical signs (Supplementary Table 3).

Furthermore the study includes archived frozen brain samples from yellow-necked field mice (A. flavicollis; n = 10) and wood mice (A. sylvaticus; n = 106) that had been collected near Grimsö Örebro county Sweden as part of the Swedish Environmental Monitoring Program of Small Rodents and in cooperation with the Swedish Infrastructure for Ecosystem Science (SITES) at Grimsö Wildlife Research Station54. Trapping was approved by the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (latest permission: NV-412-4009-10) and the Animal Ethics Committee in Umeå (latest permissions: Dnr A 61–11) and all applicable institutional and national guidelines for the use of animals were followed. Species identities were confirmed by cytochrome b gene sequencing as described previously55.

RNA extraction

Fresh-frozen samples were mechanically disrupted in 1 ml TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies Darmstadt Germany) by using the TissueLyser II (Qiagen Hilden Germany) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. After the addition of 200 µl chloroform and a centrifugation step (14000 × g 10 min 4 °C) the aqueous phase was collected and added to 250 µl isopropanol. Total RNA was extracted using the silica bead-based NucleoMagVet kit (Macherey & Nagel Düren Germany) with the KingFisher™ Flex Purification System (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham MA USA) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. In vitro-transcribed RNA of the enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) gene was added during the extraction procedure as described by Hoffmann et al.56.

RNA extraction from FFPE tissue was performed with a combination of truXTRAC FFPE total NA Kit (Covaris Brighton UK) and the Agencourt RNAdvance Tissue Kit (Beckman Coulter Krefeld Germany). FFPE sections of 3 µm thickness were loaded into a microTUBE-130 Screw-Cap (Covaris) together with 110 µl Tissue Lysis Buffer and 10 µl proteinase K solution (both Covaris). The lysate was processed with a M220 Focused ultrasonicator (Covaris) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations for acoustic pellet resuspension. The tube was subsequently incubated at 56 °C in a thermal shaker at 300 rpm overnight (no longer than 18 h). Subsequently the sample tube was cooled to room temperature and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 15 min using a microTUBE-130 centrifuge adapter. A volume of 100 µl supernatant was transferred into a clean 1.5 ml reaction tube without transferring any wax or paraffin. After another centrifugation (5 min at 20000 × g) 85 µl of the lower phase with the RNA-containing tissue pellet was transferred into a clean 1.5 ml reaction tube. It was incubated at 80 °C for 20 min and then cooled to room temperature before 175 µl B1 buffer (Covaris) were added mixed and briefly centrifuged. Thereafter 250 µl of 65% isopropanol were added mixed and briefly centrifuged. Subsequently the preparations were further processed with the Agencourt RNAdvance Tissue Kit (Beckman Coulter) with the KingFisher™ Flex Purification System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Metagenomic analysis and complete genome sequencing by HTS

Total RNA was sequenced using a universal metagenomics sequencing workflow41. In brief total RNA was extracted from fresh-frozen tissue samples using a cryoPREP impactor (Covaris) along with the Agencourt RNAdvance Tissue Kit (Beckman Coulter) and a KingFisher Flex Purification System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Then 350 ng RNA per sample were reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the SuperScript IV First-Strand cDNA Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the NEBNext Ultra II Non-Directional RNA Second Strand Synthesis Module (New England Biolabs Ipswich MA USA). Subsequently cDNA was processed to generate barcoded sequencing libraries as described in detail elsewhere41. The cDNA was fragmented to 200 base pairs (bp) length (for FFPE material) or 500 bp length (for fresh-frozen material) using an M220 Focused ultrasonicator (Covaris). Subsequent library preparation was performed as described previously with the following modification for FFPE material during size exclusion: small fragments were retained and purified twice with 1.2× Ampure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter). Libraries were quantified with the QIAseq Library Quant Assay Kit (Qiagen) and sequenced on an Ion Torrent S5XL instrument using Ion 530 chips and chemistry for 400 bp reads or Ion 540 chips and chemistry for 200 bp reads (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for fresh-frozen or FFPE material respectively. In addition to the original sequencing libraries 7 µl of the libraries were used to apply a capture enrichment with the panRubi v2 myBaits panel as described elsewhere40. For samples with expected major sequence divergence (>20%) from the initially available RusV sequences from northeastern Germany that were used for designing the panRubi v2 myBaits panel a hybridization temperature of 61 °C was used for 24–26 h. In addition a new panRubi myBaits panel was designed (v3) adding preliminary genome information from samples of Sweden and Austria to the v2 panel. The panRubi v3 myBaits panel consists of 19982 baits (60-nt oligonucleotides arranged every 20 nt 3× tiling; GC content of 67.3%) and was collapsed at 98% sequence identity. This panel was applied with a hybridization temperature of 64 °C.

For selected RusV-positive samples we additionally applied a depletion protocol in order to decrease the amount of host-derived ribosomal RNA (rRNA) within the total RNA and thereby increase the virus-to-background ratio. In detail we used a pan-Mammal riboPOOL reaction kit (siTOOLs Biotech Planegg Germany) for 0.2 and 1 µg total RNA following the manufacturer´s instructions. The rRNA-depleted RNA was then used for strand-specific library preparation with the Collibri Stranded RNA Library Prep Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The libraries were checked for sufficient quality and quantity using the 4150 TapeStation System (Agilent Technologies Santa Clara CA USA) with the High Sensitivity D1000 ScreenTape and reagents (Agilent Technologies) as well as a Qubit Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) along with the dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Pooled libraries were sequenced using a NovaSeq 6000 (Illumina San Diego CA USA) running in 100 bp mode.

De novo assembly and sequence annotation of HTS-derived sequences

The raw sequences from Ion Torrent and Illumina systems were processed as described previously40. Briefly the platform-specific adapters were initially removed from the reads and the sequences were trimmed according to their quality using either 454 Sequencing Systems Software (version 3.0) or Trim Galore (version 0.6.6)57 with automated adapter selection for Ion Torrent and Illumina reads respectively. Subsequently the reads were filtered according to their average G + C content using PRINSEQ-lite (version 0.20.4)58 with a G + C threshold of ≥60 mol%. The trimmed and filtered reads were used for de novo assembly using SPAdes genome assembler (version 3.15.2)59 running in single cell mode (--sc) and Ion Torrent mode (--iontorrent) as required. Subsequently all contigs were mapped back to an appropriate RusV reference sequence using Geneious generic mapper with medium sensitivity (Geneious Prime 2021.0.1; Biomatters Auckland New Zealand) and a consensus sequence was generated. The final sequence was annotated according to an appropriate RusV reference genome using ORF detection as provided by Geneious Prime 2021.0.1.

Bornavirus and RusV RT-qPCRs and design of adapted broad range RusV-specific primers and probes

Two RT-qPCR assays were applied for the detection of either a broad range of orthobornaviruses (panBorna v7.2; Supplementary Table 1) or specifically BoDV-1 (BoDV-1 Mix-1; Supplementary Table 1) following previously published procedures2134. Initial screening for RusV-specific RNA was performed using a TaqMan-based RT-qPCR assay (RusV Mix-1; Supplementary Table 1) targeting the initially discovered RusV sequences from a zoo in northeastern Germany as described by Bennett et al.37. The exogenously supplemented eGFP RNA was amplified as RNA extraction control as described previously56.

To establish a new RT-qPCR assay for the detection of a broader range of RusV sequences all available sequences from northeastern Germany and Sweden were aligned and a set of primers and probe (panRusV-2; Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Fig. 3) was designed to target a highly conserved region at the 5’ terminus of the genome. RT-qPCR was performed with AgPath-ID One-Step RT-PCR reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific) panRusV-2 primers (final concentration: 0.8 µM each) and probe (0.4 µM) eGFP primers (0.2 µM each) and probe (0.15 µM) and 2.5 µl extracted RNA in a total volume of 12.5 µl. The reaction was performed with the following cycler setup: 45 °C for 10 min 95 °C for 10 min 45 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 30 s. A standard RNA preparation of a RusV-positive donkey brain37 served as positive control and was used for the calibration of Cq values in each RT-qPCR analysis.

Determination of partial p150-encoding RusV sequences by Sanger sequencing

Highly conserved primer binding sites in the same alignment as described above were also identified for the amplification of 449 nt at the 5’ end of the p150-encoding sequence by conventional RT-PCR (Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Fig. 3). RNA extracted from frozen brain samples from all cats and rodents with positive panRusV RT-qPCR results was analysed using the following One-Step RT-PCR conditions: 2.5 μl RNA were amplified in a total volume of 25 μl using the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR system with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 0.4 µM each of primers RusV_80+ and RusV_528- (Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Fig. 3). The cycler setup consisted of 50 °C for 30 min 94 °C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s 63 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 25 s and a final elongation step at 68 °C for 5 min. Following separation and visualization by gel electrophoresis amplification products were purified using Zymoclean Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research Freiburg Germany) and Sanger sequencing service was provided by Microsynth Seqlab (Balgach Switzerland). Amplicons were sequenced in both directions and consensus sequences of 409 bp lengths were generated after de novo assembly of quality- and primer-trimmed raw sequences in Geneious Prime 2021.0.1.

Phylogeny and geographic mappings

Phylogenetic analysis of RusV sequences generated in this study was performed together with representative sequences of all currently known matonaviruses3760 as well as all publicly available RusV sequences from the INSDC database3740. For the phylogeny within the known matonaviruses the aa sequences of the sPP were aligned using MUSCLE (version 3.8.425)61 with a maximum of 100 iterations. A maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree was then calculated using IQ-TREE2 (version 2.2.0)62 running in automatic model selection mode (FLU + F + I + G4) and applying 100000 ultrafast bootstrap replicates63. For phylogenetic analysis of RusV nt sequences the complete or nearly complete RusV genome sequences were aligned using MAFFT (version 7.450)64. A ML tree was then calculated as described above (model: TIM3 + F + I). The alignment was further used for sequence comparison with a sliding window approach that calculated the pairwise distances (Jukes Cantor 1969 model) within a window of 200 nt every 50 nt. A phylogenetic tree of partial p150 protein-coding sequences of 409 nt length was built as described above (model: TN + F + G4).

Histologic examination

Brain and spinal cord samples of cats were harvested on post mortem examination via extensive craniectomy-laminectomy. For histology brain and spinal cord tissues from cats as well as brain tissue from all eight RusV-positive wood mice were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. Fixed neural tissues were routinely sampled processed in an automatic tissue processor embedded in paraffin wax sectioned at 2–4 μm and stained with histological standard stains including haematoxylin eosin (H.E.). A selection of brains from four staggering and seven control cats underwent Luxol Fast Blue-Cresyl Echt Violet stain as described by Klüver and Barrera65 (Supplementary Fig. 6).

Sections were microscopically examined for the presence of non-suppurative lymphohistiocytic encephalitis meningoencephalitis and/or meningoencephalomyelitis. Inflammation was graded mild to severe based on the extent of inflammatory cell infiltrates. Mild encephalitis comprised few perivascular infiltrates most of which showed one to two layers of cells and were not necessarily present in all investigated locations. One or two larger infiltrates in a single location were allowed to occur in this category. Moderate encephalitis comprised several infiltrates per location showing three to five layers of cells allowing single locations with larger or smaller infiltrates. Severe encephalitis comprised many perivascular infiltrates most of which showed several layers of cells (>5) in the majority of investigated locations.

Detection of RusV-specific RNA by ISH

A custom-designed RNAscope probe was provided by Advanced Cell Diagnostics (Newark NJ USA) based on the consensus sequence of the available RusV sequences from Sweden targeting the highly conserved region at the 5’ end of the RusV genome (catalogue no. 1145591-C1). A probe targeting the messenger RNA (mRNA) of the ubiquitous widely expressed housekeeping gene peptidyl-prolyl-isomerase-B (Felis catus-PPIB; cat. no. 455011) was used as positive control while a probe targeting bacterial dihydropicolinate reductase (DapB; cat. no. 310043) was used as a negative control probe. Viral nucleic acid was determined using ISH with the manual RNAscope 2.5 High Definition RED assay (Advanced Cell Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly brain sections were deparaffinized and pre-treated with 1× Target Retrieval solution and RNAscope® Protease Plus solution prior to hybridization with the target probe. Subsequently the tissue was treated with a series of pre-amplifiers and amplifiers followed by the application of a chromogenic substrate. The samples were counterstained with Hematoxylin Gill No. 2 (Merck Darmstadt Germany).

Brain sections of a RusV-positive capybara37 served as positive control and showed positive reactivity with the specific RusV RNAscope probe. A brain sample from a RusV-negative control cat incubated with the RusV RNAscope probe and a brain sample from a RusV-positive cat incubated with an irrelevant RNAscope probe (Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae) served as negative controls and yielded no reactivity. The scoring of the signals was performed as described in Table 2.

Recombinant protein production and generation of a monoclonal anti-RusV capsid protein antibody

A synthetic DNA string fragment encoding aa 128 to 308 of the RusV capsid protein based on the sequence from an infected donkey from northeastern Germany (accession number MN552442.1) was ordered from GeneArt Gene synthesis (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and inserted into the pEXPR103 expression vector (IBA Lifesciences Göttingen Germany) in-frame with a Strep-tag-coding sequence at the 3′ end. The protein with a C-terminal Strep-tag was expressed in human Expi293 cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and subsequently purified using Strep-Tactin XT Superflow high capacity resin (IBA Lifesciences) following the manufacturer’s instructions.

For monoclonal antibody generation two female BALB/c mice aged four and twelve months originating from the specific pathogen-free breeding unit of the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut were immunized intraperitoneally with 20 μg of purified capsid protein. The animals were kept in type II L cages at 12 h dark/light cycle 20 to 24 °C room temperature and 45 to 65% humidity. The work was performed in compliance with the national and European legislation with approval by the competent authority of the Federal State of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania Germany (reference number: 7221.3-2-042/17). The immunization as well as the generation of hybridoma cells were performed as described previously66. The final RusV capsid-specific monoclonal antibody 2H11B1 was identified by indirect ELISA and immunofluorescence staining of transfected RK-13 rabbit kidney cells expressing the recombinant RusV capsid protein.

Detection of RusV and BoDV-1 antigen by IHC

Brain sections were evaluated for expression of RusV capsid protein using the mouse monoclonal primary antibody 2H11B1. The slides were deparaffinised and underwent antigen retrieval in the microwave (750 W 20 min) being immersed in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) before incubation with the primary antibody (dilution 1:100) at 4 °C for 18 h. Successful labelling was demonstrated using ImmPRESS® polymer anti-mouse IgG (LINARIS Biologische Produkte Dossenheim Germany) coupled to peroxidase and a diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride staining kit (ImmPACT DAB substrate HRP; BIOZOL Diagnostica Eching Germany) according to the manufacturers’ instructions. After peroxidase reaction sections were counterstained with haematoxylin. Sections of a RusV-positive capybara brain37 served as virus-positive tissue control whereas brain sections of cats from the control groups that had tested negative for RusV by RT-qPCR served as negative tissue control (Supplementary Fig. 8). Specificity of the anti-mouse IgG polymer was evaluated by two sections each of capybara brain and of RT-PCR-confirmed RusV-positive cat SWE_07 in which 2H11B1 antibody was replaced by horse serum and by anti-FCoV mouse monoclonal antibody (FIPV 3–70 LINARIS Biologische Produkte; Supplementary Fig. 8). The scoring of the signals was performed as described in Table 2.

Cat brain sections were furthermore assessed for the expression of BoDV-1 nucleoprotein using murine monoclonal antibody Bo18 (obtained from the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut Greifswald Germany)67 with the ABC detection kit (biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG; BIOZOL Diagnostica) and diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (ImmPACT DAB substrate HRP; BIOZOL Diagnostica). Brain sections of a horse confirmed as BoDV-1-infected by RT-qPCR served as positive control (Supplementary Fig. 1). Replacement of Bo18 antibody by an irrelevant mouse monoclonal antibody (FIPV 3–70) was used as negative reagent control on BoDV-1-positive horse tissue and RusV-positive feline brain SWE_07.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vaW5ub3ZhdGlvbm9yaWdpbnMuY29tL2VuL2xhaW8vcGhpbGlwcy1uYXRsYWItY2xvc2VzLW1hcmtpbmctdGhlLWVuZC1vZi1hLXBpb25lZXJpbmctZXJhLWluLXRlY2gtcmVzZWFyY2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Philips NatLab Closes Marking the End of a Pioneering Era in Tech Research,"Philips recently announced a significant reduction in its research budget resulting in the downsizing of Philips Research formerly known as NatLab. Even while the news is unfortunate NatLab has left a lasting impact on the tech industry through its numerous groundbreaking contributions. It has played a crucial role in the formation of successful companies such as ASML NXP and Thermo Fisher Scientific. The end of NatLab has elicited disappointment from tech leaders in Eindhoven.

Professor Maarten Steinbuch former Philips employee and current professor at Eindhoven University of Technology is one of many who regret the closing of NatLab. “I saw Philips go from a leader to a follower in the space of 10 years” he told Het Financieele Dagblad. Professor Steinbuch is also the Scientific Director of the Eindhoven Engine an entrepreneurship initiative by Eindhoven University of Technology.

Professor Steinbuch is no stranger to entrepreneurship. He holds nine patents and co-founded mechatronics companies precision surgical robotics simulations and consulting. He is a strong advocate for scientists to pursue entrepreneurship and provides advice on how to do so. “I recommend scientists with entrepreneurial ambitions to resign in part from their day job as it will make them better entrepreneurs by understanding customer needs better. To be a successful entrepreneur you need to be a self-starter with an intrinsic drive a long-term vision focus and persistence.”

The legacy of NatLab

NatLab’s legacy can be found in countless technologies that have changed the world. The development of the Compact Disc (CD) in the early 1980s was one of its major successes. This was followed by groundbreaking research into digital video. In the 1990s NatLab created the first navigation systems for cars.

Martin Thoone proposed to Philips’ NatLab in the early 1980s to conduct research into car navigation systems. Despite the lack of enthusiasm Thoone persevered and was at the cradle of an innovation that would be embraced all over the world. He succeeded in raising money from Renault Volkswagen and BMW to start his research and presented his idea at a conference in Detroit.

What’s Next?

The closing of NatLab brings an end to a long era of research and presents an opportunity for new initiatives. Professor Steinbuch believes that the Eindhoven Engine can fill some of the void left by NatLab’s closure.

“The Eindhoven Engine provides researchers with access to resources that are otherwise difficult or impossible to obtain” says Professor Steinbuch. “We guide how to use these resources effectively to make meaningful contributions to science.” The Engine also offers mentorship programs and training workshops on topics such as commercialization and business development.

While NatLab may have come to an end its spirit lives on through projects like the Eindhoven Engine and a campus like High Tech Campus Eindhoven where the NatLab was located for decades. For those wishing to make a lasting impact on technology Professor Steinbuch advises aspiring entrepreneurs to take risks and embrace failure as part of their journey.

The closure of Philips NatLab marks an end to a long era of research that saw the development of important technologies such as digital audio and digital video. Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium (NatLab) was established in 1914 by Gerard and Anton Philips as a way for their company to independently create patents without relying on third parties. At its peak it employed 2000 people with 600 having a university education.

We initially tested whether DNMTs were S-nitrosylated using the physiological NO donor S-nitrosocysteine (SNOC) in HEK293 cells that had been transfected with each subtype of DNMT. In biotin-switch assays we demonstrated that exposure to SNOC markedly enhanced S-nitrosylation of DNMTs (forming SNO-DNMT); importantly the effect of SNOC was concentration-dependent (Fig. 1a Supplementary Fig. 1a)19. In addition S-nitrosylation of endogenous DNMTs was observed (Supplementary Fig. 1b). We also detected SNO-DNMT3B formation using purified recombinant DNMT3B and found a significant increase in SNO-DNMT3B after exposure to SNOC suggesting that SNOC can directly modify DNMT3B (Supplementary Fig. 1c d). We hypothesized that NO-related species may modulate DNMT activity through S-nitrosylation. We focused on the Cys residue at position 651 in the catalytic domain of DNMT3B because it is located in proximity to a partial motif for S-nitrosylation2021. To determine if indeed this residue is a target of S-nitrosylation we substituted a serine (Ser) for the Cys and assessed SNO-DNMT3B formation by performing biotin-switch assays. After 24 h cells were exposed to the physiological NO donor S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) used here because it has a longer half-life than SNOC or as a control to glutathione (GSH). We found that the DNMT3B (C651S) mutant nearly completely abrogated S-nitrosylation (Fig. 1b Supplementary Fig. 1e). Identification of the S-nitrosylation site by biotin-switch assay using full-length wild-type (WT) DNMT3B was subsequently confirmed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). MS/MS analysis verified that Cys651 was modified by biotin after exposure to SNOC and replacement of the-SNO moiety by biotin (Fig. 1c). These results are consistent with the notion that Cys651 is the predominant S-nitrosylation site on DNMT3B.

To investigate whether endogenously generated NO-related species can also induce SNO-DNMT formation we used HEK cells stably expressing NOS1 (nNOS). DNMT3B was S-nitrosylated by endogenous NO in response to A23187 (to induce calcium-activation of nNOS) in a NOS inhibitor-sensitive manner (Supplementary Fig. 1f). Furthermore in RAW cells we assessed if NO species derived from NOS2 (iNOS) induced by treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) plus IFN-γ could S-nitrosylate DNMT3B. In this paradigm we also detected SNO-DNMT3B formation in a NOS inhibitor-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 1g). To demonstrate relevance to human carcinomas we next examined freshly-obtained colon cancer tissues from surgical specimens (Supplementary Fig. 1h). Indeed we found evidence for SNO-DNMT3B in human colon cancer but not in control tissue (Fig. 1d e).

Next we studied the effect of S-nitrosylation on DNMT enzymatic activity. Using recombinant DNMT enzymes in an in vitro assay we found that NO-related species induced SNO-DNMT3B formation and attenuated enzymatic activity (i.e. DNA methylation) in a concentration-dependent manner (Supplementary Figs. 1i j and 2a) and treatment with the chemical reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) abrogated the NO-induced inhibition of DNMT activity under our conditions (Supplementary Fig. 2b) but see refs. 2223. However when we tested the effect of S-nitrosylation on DNMT activity in more physiological cell-based assays we obtained a different set of results. Strikingly only DNMT3B but not DNMT1 enzymatic activity was significantly inhibited by S-nitrosylation in these cell-based assays. To account for this finding we found that exposure to SNOC resulted in some degree of S-nitrosylation of both DNMT1 and DNMT3B in the cells (Fig. 1f) but noted less nitrosylation and loss of the nitrosylation signal in DNMT1 with time in the cell-based assays (Supplementary Fig. 2c) possibly because of the endogenous redox milieu in cells. In contrast S-nitrosylation of DNMT3B was sustained in the cell-based assays similar to our findings in vitro with recombinant proteins. In parallel cell-based assays NO significantly inhibited the enzymatic activity of DNMT3B but not DNMT1 (Fig. 1g Supplementary Fig. 2d). These results demonstrate that while both DNMT1 and DNMT3B can be S-nitrosylated only the activity of DNMT3B is significantly affected by this reaction in cell-based activity assays. The relatively small extent and short time course of S-nitrosylation of DNMT1 compared to that of DNMT3B (Fig. 1f) can explain this lack of significant inhibition of DNMT1 enzymatic activity after exposure to NO in cell-based assays. Moreover since global methylation is influenced by DNMT1 and not DNMT3B activity these data predict that S-nitrosylation of DNMTs would not affect global methylation in cell-based assays exactly as we observed (Supplementary Fig. 2e). On the other hand the persistence of SNO-DNMT3B should affect specific DNMT3B targets of methylation in cells as we subsequently demonstrate.

Affording further mechanistic insight for these findings the cysteine residue (C651) that we identified to be S-nitrosylated in DNMT3B is known to be in the catalytic site for enzymatic activity20. As we have published previously24 S-nitrosylation of an enzyme’s catalytic site cysteine represents a mechanism of inhibition and indeed mutation of this catalytic cysteine abrogated enzyme activity similar to S-nitrosylation20. These findings are consistent with the notion that DNMT enzymatic activity is regulated by redox-mediated posttranslational modification particularly via reaction with NO-related species to form S-nitrosylated DNMT3B.

Gene expression via DNMT3B dysfunction by NO

DNMT3B is believed to be involved in de novo posttranslational DNA modifications that are associated with the onset of several diseases including cancers25. In order to study the effect of SNO-DNMT3B in this process we initially conducted a transcriptomic analysis by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to detect genes that were up- or down-regulated after NO exposure in HeLa cell-based assays. This list of these genes is shown in volcano plots (Supplementary Fig. 3a–c). Within 24 h of exposure to an NO donor we detected 173 genes that were changed >1.5-fold with P < 0.05. To confirm these results we selected four genes (CA9 EGR1 ALDOC and GPR137C) that were upregulated by NO and performed quantitative (q)PCR analysis which confirmed a significant increase in their expression levels (Supplementary Fig. 3d). Notably with only 173 genes significantly affected the action of NO appears to be on a rather limited set of genes not affecting the entire genome.

To confirm this conclusion at an epigenetic level we next performed DNA methylation profiling using the TruSeq Methyl Capture EPIC Library Prep Kit (Illumina) to elucidate the profile of methylation/demethylation in genome-wide CpG regions in HeLa cells. For each sample we scored methylated cytosines with ≥10 reads by bisulfite sequence analysis. Of the detected 25805689 methylated cytosine sites in the whole genome by this method (Supplementary Data 1) we found a greater than 10% decrease in methylation in only 505039 (or <2%) of such sites after overexpression of NOS2 (to increase endogenous NO) or exposure to an exogenous NO donor. From these results we concluded that the vast majority of CpG methylation sites in the whole genome were not changed after exposure to NO but individual CpG sites were indeed found to be less methylated. Hence it does not appear that NO affects global methylation status per se. In addition another index of global DNA methylation employing antibodies to 5-methyl cytosine revealed no significant changes in methylation of whole genomic DNA (Supplementary Fig. 2e). We thus concluded that NO did not affect the vast majority of CpG methylation sites in the whole genome but did result in an increase in individual demethylated CpG sites (Supplementary Figs. 4a–d 5a Supplementary Data 1).

Concerning individual genes whose expression is upregulated following NO exposure we carefully surveyed each such gene for the presence of CpG areas in the 5′-region to determine if there were changes in the methylation/demethylation ratio. As examples we observed that the vast majority of cytosines in the CpG sites of the genes CA9 EGR1 ALDOC and GPR137C were not demethylated. Some specific sites however were found to be demethylated after NOS2 overexpression or SNOC exposure compared to control (Supplementary Figs. 4a–d and 5a). Specifically the number of demethylated cytosines in the genes CCND2 CA9 EGR1 ALDOC and GPR137C was 30 7 33 5 and 20 respectively. In line with these results recent reports have indicated that the percentage of methylated cytosines in the whole genome of Dnmt3b-deficient compared to Dnmt3b-WT mice decreased by ~10% 66.35% compared to 76.94% respectively26. These results suggest that (i) the contribution of DNMT3B may be limited and involves only ~10% of methylation sites in the whole-genome and (ii) exposure to NO decreased the level of individual methylated cytosines in CpG areas consistent with our finding of inhibition of DNMT3B activity.

Our bioinformatic analysis revealed that among the genes that display demethylated CpG sites in response to NO were multiple genes associated with cancer. Hence we next determined if SNO-DNMT3B formation might enhance mRNA expression encoded by these genes. We initially focused on the cyclin D2 (Ccnd2) gene because transcriptional upregulation of this gene and demethylation of CpG in its promoter have been detected in carcinomas including gastric carcinoma2728. While Ccnd2 message was not detected by the primer set in the RNA-seq dataset we found by TruSeq Methyl Capture EPIC analysis that the CpG methylation/demethylation ratio decreased after exposure to NO (Supplementary Fig. 5a). We then monitored temporal expression of Ccnd2 mRNA in HeLa cells in response to GSNO and found a statistically-significant (~2-fold) elevation in the level of Ccnd2 mRNA at 24 h. This response to GSNO was sustained for 48 h and then gradually decreased by 72 h (Fig. 2a). In a similar fashion siRNA knockdown of DNMT3B markedly enhanced the level of Ccnd2 mRNA (Fig. 2b). Moreover after DNMT3B knockdown no further enhancement of Ccnd2 expression was observed in response to an NO donor (Fig. 2b) consistent with the notion that the major contributor to NO-mediated upregulation of Ccnd2 involved S-nitrosylation and thus inhibition of DNMT3B rather than another DNMT such as DNMT3A or DNMT1 which are also present in these cells.

Methylation levels at CpG sites (Targets 1 and 2) within the promoter region of Ccnd2 were detected by bisulfite sequencing. Experiments were performed using 34–35 samples from triplicate cultures run in parallel. Representative results for the CpG sites of the Ccnd2 promoter in cells 12–48 h after exposure to GSNO.

In addition transduction with DNMT3B but not DNMT1 or DNMT3A significantly decreased Ccnd2 mRNA levels (Fig. 2c). Thus it is unlikely that S-nitrosylation of DNMT3A or DNMT1 could have contributed to the effects on Ccnd2 associated with tumor formation observed here since altering the level of either of these DNMTs did not influence the level of Ccnd2 expression. Collectively these findings are consistent with the notion that DNMT3B is a key enzyme involved in the regulation of Ccnd2 expression and inhibition of DNMT3B activity by S-nitrosylation results in increased Ccnd2 at the transcriptional level. To obtain more direct evidence for this conclusion we investigated the effect of overexpression of non-nitrosylatable DNMT3B (C651S) representing a ‘dead enzyme’ on Ccnd2 mRNA induction in HEK cells. As expected compared to WT DNMT3B overexpression of mutant DNMT3B (C651S) did not inhibit Ccnd2 mRNA expression20 (Fig. 2d).

Next we measured the methylation/demethylation ratio in various CpG target areas of the Ccnd2 gene after NOS2 overexpression or NO exposure. We found that the CpG methylation/demethylation ratio in one area (Target 1: −3687 – −3398) was significantly decreased (~25%) within 24 h of exposure to GSNO (Fig. 2e). Moreover each cytosine in the target region (at locations −3621 −3485 −3430 −3426 −3424) was sensitive to NO (Supplementary Fig. 5b c) becoming significantly less methylated between 12 to 48 h post GSNO exposure (Fig. 2g–k). Interestingly in a second target area (Target 2: +642 – +1040) the CpG methylation/demethylation ratio was not greatly affected by GSNO (Fig. 2f). Thus there may be a heterogeneous response to NO in the DNA methylation/demethylation patterns among different CpG islands within a single gene29303132 and such varying patterns have been observed previously after treatment with a DNMT inhibitor2930. These findings are consistent with the notion that some (but not all) CpG sites are targeted by NO-sensitive DNMT3B. Taken together our data indicate that redox modification of DNMT3B by S-nitrosylation can function as a unique and robust regulator of gene expression in cancerous cells.

Isolation of a specific inhibitor of DNMT3B S-nitrosylation

Next we sought to develop a specific inhibitor of DNMT3B S-nitrosylation as a possible therapeutic agent. Hierarchical virtual screening approaches represent an established methodology for filtering complex chemical libraries containing very large numbers of small molecules towards a reasonable number of candidates for further biological testing3334. To this end in order to identify compounds capable of inhibiting DNMT3B S-nitrosylation but not enzymatic activity we initially created a DNMT3B model based on the known atomic structure of DNMT3A. In the absence of structural information about DNMT3B-DNA binding and Cys651 S-nitrosylation we hypothesized that a compound binding to the loop region extending from Thr773 to Asn786 might lock DNMT3B in a conformation suitable for DNA binding and subsequent DNA methyltransferase activity but not favorable for Cys651 S-nitrosylation. We explored small-molecule binding pockets in the vicinity of Cys651 in three models of DNMT3B. The binding pocket calculations using SiteMap indeed revealed a high-scoring pocket near the loop region from Thr773 to Asn786 in all three DNMT3B models (Supplementary Fig. 6a–e). The Sitescore values of 1.02 1.05 and 0.91 for the three DNMT3B models indicated the druggability of this region (Supplementary Fig. 6f). We then docked a large collection of chemicals with this model. Virtual screening was carried out separately for all three of these pockets and the top-ranking compounds from each run were merged and visually analyzed for the interaction they made with the binding pocket. Finally compounds making interactions with amino-acid residues in the loop region from Thr773 to Asn786 were prioritized for further testing. From 4 × 106 chemicals we narrowed the candidates to approximately 100 via two independent in silico docking steps.

We then tested these compounds for an inhibitory effect on SNO-DNMT3B formation while counterscreening to exclude compounds that affected enzymatic activity. With this paradigm we identified (E)-N′-(34-dihydroxybenzylidene)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-5-carbohydrazide designated here as DBIC as fulfilling these criteria (Fig. 3a). Furthermore molecular docking showed that the catechol and benzimidazole moieties are essential for the interaction between DBIC and DNMT3B (Fig. 3b). Indeed we demonstrated that loss of the two hydroxyl groups of the catechol (compound DBIC-neg1) or the benzimidazole moiety (compound DBIC-neg2) completely abolished the inhibitory effect on SNO-DNMT3B formation (Fig. 3c Supplementary Fig. 7a c). Moreover DBIC inhibited SNO-DNMT3B formation in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC 50 value of ~75 nM. While DBIC also impaired S-nitrosylation of DNMT1 and DNMT3A this only occurred at IC 50 values greater than ~50 μM and ~500 nM respectively (Fig. 3c d). In cells DBIC also attenuated the formation of SNO-DNMT3B induced by endogenous NO (Fig. 3e). In addition the DNMT3B double mutant (Q772A/F809A) designed to disrupt binding to DBIC led to the loss of the DBIC inhibitory effect on SNO-DNMT3B formation (Supplementary Fig. 7d).

Next we employed surface plasmon resonance analysis to assess direct binding of DBIC to DNMT3B protein (Fig. 3f). DBIC manifested binding to immobilized DNMT3B in a concentration-dependent manner and at concentrations as low as 12.3 nM the lowest concentration used in our experiments. In contrast DBIC neg-1 and DBIC neg-2 displayed a much lower binding response to DNMT3B than DBIC. These observations suggest that DBIC directly binds to DNMT3B with higher affinity compared to the inactive DBIC derivatives. Critically at 50–100 nM DBIC prevented formation of SNO-DNMT3B and inhibition of DNMT3B enzymatic activity in the presence of an NO donor (Supplementary Fig. 7e Fig. 3g).

The core scaffold of DBIC benzylidene carbohydrazide is well-known among structures that are pan-assay interference compounds (PAINS) which are usually avoided in drug discovery efforts. Although it is generally accepted that a compound can be predicted as a potential PAINS from its core scaffold it is also well-known that the chemical properties of a compound can be significantly modified by substitutions on the core scaffold thus rendering the compound “PAINless.” For example Baell and Holloway considered the hydroxyphenylhydrazone scaffold which shares the core structure of benzylidene carbohydrazide35. Hydroxyphenylhydrazone scaffold-containing compounds have also been identified as PAINS. However they described differences between 2- and 4-hydroxyphenylhydrazones highlighting the effect of substitutions on the core scaffold and how it can render the compound PAINless. Similarly DBIC contains a 34-dihydroxyphenylhydrazone core and an additional N-acyl substitution. In fact this class of N-acylhydrazone (NAH)-containing compounds are found in FDA-approved drugs and in several clinical trial candidates that have shown both safety and efficacy36. These prior publications highlight the fact that not all NAH-containing compounds are PAINS. Specifically for DBIC we found that removing the dihydroxyl group (DBIC-neg1) or the benzimidazole group (DBIC-neg2) while retaining the NAH scaffold rendered the compounds inactive demonstrating that the NAH core per se in DBIC is not causing PAINS.

In addition to corroborate these findings we derived a second active compound lacking PAINS structure (Supplementary Fig. 7f). We found that this compound (N-(2-(34-dihydroxyphenyl)ethyl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole-6-carboxamide) designated DBIC-der1 can also effectively attenuate SNO-DNMT3B formation in cells (Supplementary Fig. 7g h). Moreover in silico simulation revealed that the new derivative (DBIC-der1) can associate with the same amino acids as observed for DBIC itself. Thus we report that both DBIC and DBIC-der1 can bind to DNMT3B protein to prevent S-nitrosylation. We conclude that in this particular case the PAINS structure of DBIC is involved in a specific interaction with DNMT3B.

Considering potential off-target effects of DBIC we had previously demonstrated that phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) another protein implicated in the etiology of many cancers as a tumor suppressor is highly sensitive to S-nitrosylation by donation of NO species;7 however unlike its action on DNMT3B DBIC did not affect the formation of SNO-PTEN (Supplementary Fig. 7b). In addition in a screen for off-target effects high concentrations of DBIC (≥10 μM) did not substantially stimulate or inhibit a large number of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) nuclear hormone receptors transporters or ion channels in cell-based assays (Supplementary Fig. 8a). We found that treatment of cells with 100 nM DBIC inhibited DNMT3B S-nitrosylation without affecting enzymatic activity; however at very high concentrations (>10 μM) DBIC slightly inhibited DNMT3B activity (Supplementary Fig. 8b). In contrast to DBIC theaflavin-33′-digallate (TF-3) a phenol antioxidant and non-selective DNMT3 inhibitor strongly disrupted DNMT3B enzymatic activity37. We also considered the possibility that the inhibitory effect of DBIC on S-nitrosylation might be due to its scavenging ability; however we found that DBIC even at micromolar concentrations did not function as a NO scavenger (Supplementary Fig. 8c). Moreover at 10 µM representing 100-times the therapeutic concentration DBIC manifested no cytotoxicity on several normal cell types (Supplementary Fig. 8d). Thus these results indicate that DBIC is a unique compound that at low concentrations specifically inhibits SNO-DNMT3B formation without affecting enzyme activity and in the absence of cell toxicity.

As shown above we found that NO donors could stimulate Ccnd2 induction via a decrease in the methylation/demethylation ratio of the promoter CpG region in HeLa cells (Fig. 2a g–k). In contrast DBIC significantly abrogated NO-induced Ccnd2 mRNA expression in HeLa cells (Supplementary Fig. 9a). Moreover at 100 nM DBIC prevented the increase in tumor cell number induced by NO; as a control DBIC-neg1 had no such effect (Supplementary Fig. 9b). In addition DBIC significantly ameliorated the decrease in the methylated CpG ratio in the Ccnd2 promoter engendered by NO (Supplementary Fig. 9c d).

Pharmacological characterization of DBIC

We next investigated if DBIC could inhibit tumor formation as RNS are known to play a role in the conversion of adenoma to adenocarcinoma in a NOS inhibitor-sensitive manner in human colonic adenoma (FPCK-1-1) cells and in mouse regressive fibrosarcoma (QR-32) cells38. We observed significant tumorigenic conversion in FPCK-1-1 cells after exposure to the long-lived NO donor NOC18; large spherical clusters of tumor cells formed in three-dimensional (3D) multicellular cultures (Fig. 4a b Supplementary Fig. 10a). Subsequently both control and vehicle-treated cells underwent anoikis. Strikingly treatment with DBIC but not DBIC-neg1 significantly blocked spheroid formation induced by NO in the FPCK-1-1 cells and QR-32 cells (Fig. 4a b Supplementary Fig. 10a). Next we characterized the effect of DBIC on tumor formation in vivo in an inflammation-related mouse model of carcinogenesis3940. For this purpose we used the regressive tumor cell line QR-32 which grows to lethal proportions after being implanted subcutaneously within a foreign body to induce inflammation39. Intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration (25 mg/kg/day for 15 days) of DBIC or 1400 W (NOS2 specific inhibitor) but not DBIC-neg1 significantly decreased the proportion of mice bearing tumors (Fig. 4c).

Fig. 4: DBIC suppresses NO-induced tumor formation. a FPCK-1-1 cells were treated with 100 nM DBIC DBIC-neg1 or 126 μM NOC18 every 3 days for a month before transfer to 3D culture. Spheroidal aggregate formation of FPCK-1-1 (or FPCKpP1-4 control) cells was assessed 3 d after plating. Scale bar 50 μm. The data represent one of four separate experiments. b DBIC inhibited NO-induced sphere formation assessed 7 days post plating. Values are mean ± s.e.m. (n = 4; ***P < 0.001 by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni’s post hoc test). Treatments: None (black); vehicle (blue); DBIC (purple); DBIC-neg1 (green); NO (white); NO + DBIC (red); NO + DBIC-neg1 (orange). Colors correspond to code in representative micrographs in (a). c DBIC inhibits inflammation-related carcinogenesis in vivo. DBIC DBIC-neg1 (25 mg/kg/day) or 1400 W (6 mg/kg/day) administered by i.p. injection from pre-implantation day 2 through day 35 post cell implantation. Regressive QR-32 cells (1 × 105) were implanted into mice on day 0 in a subcutaneously pre-inserted foreign body (gelatin sponge 10 × 5 × 3 mm). **P < 0.01 ***P < 0.001 vs. vehicle by χ2-test. d Time course of DBIC concentration in plasma after single i.p. administration (25 mg/kg) measured by LC-MS/MS.

We then evaluated in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of DBIC in a mouse model of inflammation-related carcinogenesis (ICR) (Fig. 4d Supplementary Fig. 10b). A single i.p. administration of DBIC (25 mg/kg) resulted in a plasma maximum concentration (Cmax) of 2.5 μM which appears to be sufficient for inhibiting tumor formation from our data. Within 6 h of administration DBIC was nearly completely depleted from the blood (Fig. 4d). This finding may reflect good tissue transportability of the compound because of its large volume of distribution at steady state (Vdss) of 23.8 L/kg (Supplementary Fig. 10b). Indeed the concentration of DBIC in tumor tissue (mean of 2.5 nmol/g) after continuous i.p. administration was nearly equivalent to the plasma Cmax (Fig. 4e). Despite only partial inhibition of DNMT3B by once-daily i.p. treatment with DBIC this was sufficient to induce significant inhibition of tumor incidence in treated mice. Hence improved in vivo dosing of would be predicted to reduce the tumor incidence even further. Moreover DBIC caused no obvious toxicity (such as weight loss) or alteration in the appearance or behavior of tumor-bearing mice (Supplementary Fig. 10c).

Furthermore we found that DBIC abrogated formation of SNO-DNMT3B within tumor tissue isolated in vivo from the mouse model (Fig. 4f Supplementary Fig. 10d). Finally to determine whether the level of SNO-DNMT3B detected in human colon cancer is of pathophysiological relevance we calculated the ratio of SNO-DNMT3B (determined by biotin-switch assays) to total DNMT3B (from immunoblots) and found that the ratio in human cancer tissue was similar to that encountered in our in vitro and in vivo cancer models (Figs. 1e 4g Supplementary Figs. 10e f). This finding indicates that pathophysiologically-relevant amounts of SNO-DNMT3B are present in human colon cancers. Collectively our findings show that DNA methylation is regulated at least in part by S-nitrosylation of DNMT forming SNO-DNMT. The resulting decreased methylation within selected promoter CpG sites affects expression of specific genes associated with neoplastic transformation such as Ccnd2. A recent study reported that NO modulates DNMT1 degradation in models of breast cancer but did not find an effect of S-nitrosylation of DNMT1 per se on methylation status41.

In the present study we demonstrate that SNO-DNMT3B inhibited its enzymatic activity in cell-based assays whereas S-nitrosylation of DNMT1 did not affect its enzymatic activity in cell-based or in vivo colon cancer model systems. Moreover we describe a unique modulator of DNMT3B that can specifically attenuate its modification by SNO but not its enzymatic activity (Fig. 4h). This chemical modulator and potential therapeutic designated DBIC significantly mitigated cell proliferation and tumorigenic conversion in vivo. Prior publications had reported the importance of NO and epigenetic regulation to tumorigenesis4243; however the link between these two remained unknown. In the present study we link these events in a mechanistic fashion that also provides important therapeutic insight.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbmluZXdzLmluL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvYXNpYS90aWJldGFuLWFjdGl2aXN0cy1wcm90ZXN0LW92ZXItbWFzcy1kbmEtY29sbGVjdGlvbi1wb2xpY3ktb2YtY2hpbmEtaHVtYW4tcmlnaHRzLXZpb2xhdGlvbnMyMDIzMDIwNDE3NDQ0MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tibetan activists protest over mass DNA collection policy of China human rights violations,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.aninews.in/news/world/asia/tibetan-activists-protest-over-mass-dna-collection-policy-of-china-human-rights-violations20230204174442 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbmluZXdzLmluL25ld3Mvd29ybGQvYXNpYS90aWJldGFuLWFjdGl2aXN0cy1wcm90ZXN0LW92ZXItbWFzcy1kbmEtY29sbGVjdGlvbi1wb2xpY3ktb2YtY2hpbmEtaHVtYW4tcmlnaHRzLXZpb2xhdGlvbnMyMDIzMDIwNDE3NDQ0MtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The theory gained steam on Facebook TikTok and Twitter in recent weeks with some users reporting that their hens stopped laying eggs and speculating that common chicken feed products were the cause. Some went a step further to suggest that feed producers had intentionally made their products deficient to stop backyard egg production forcing people to buy eggs at inflated prices.

“One of the largest egg producers in the country cut a deal with one of the largest feed producers in the country to change their feed formula so it no longer contains enough protein and minerals for your chickens to produce eggs” one Facebook user wrote in a post shared more than 2000 times. “They are now price gouging eggs to make bank.”

But poultry experts say there’s no evidence for such claims. Here’s a closer look at the facts.

CLAIM: Chicken feed companies have altered their products to stop backyard hens from laying eggs and drive up demand for commercial eggs.

THE FACTS: U.S. egg prices in grocery stores more than doubled over the past year due to an outbreak of bird flu combined with increasing labor and supply costs.

Some backyard chicken owners may have separately found their chickens underperforming but experts say the issues are unrelated. While feed quality can affect hens’ egg-laying abilities state agricultural officials told The Associated Press they have not heard of any widespread issues with feed affecting egg production and several major feed suppliers say they haven’t changed their formulas.

Experts say there are far more mundane explanations for the poultry’s meager production.

“Is there a broad conspiracy? No there’s not a broad conspiracy” said Todd Applegate a professor in poultry science at the University of Georgia. “Beyond feed there are a lot probably even more so things from the management and from the bird’s environment that creates different things that would cause her to either go out of production or lower her production.”

More than 43 million of the 58 million birds slaughtered over the past year to control the bird flu virus have been egg-laying chickens The Associated Press has reported.

“Because of high path avian influenza we’ve had to depopulate millions of laying hens. And when you take that many chickens out of production there’s fewer eggs” said Ken Anderson a poultry industry specialist at North Carolina State University. “And when there’s fewer eggs the price goes up.”

Democratic U.S. Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island and a farmer-led advocacy group have called for an investigation into potential egg price-gouging by producers. But there is no evidence that altered chicken feed is driving steep egg prices.

Agricultural officials in multiple states including North Carolina and Georgia told the AP they have received no reports of widespread problems.

“Our members have not really heard any exact reports of any correlation between the feed and egg production” said Austin Therrell executive director of the Association of American Feed Control Officials a group of local state and federal agencies responsible for regulating animal feeds.

Therrell noted however that officials have fielded questions from people who saw feed-related claims on social media.

Other factors could explain the individual reports of low backyard egg yields experts say. Limited daylight hours in the winter can reduce or stop hens’ egg production as can cold weather said Applegate. Improperly stored feed can become compromised and affect egg production too.

“Backyard flock producers don’t necessarily follow lighting programs to support peak egg production” Anderson said. “A lot of backyard flock people utilize natural daylight.”

Many social media users claimed that specific feed products such as those offered by Purina Animal Nutrition and Tractor Supply a chain of farm supplies stores were at fault. Some said their hens started laying again after they switched feeds or made their own. But the companies deny that their products are to blame.

“We confirm there have not been formulation changes to Purina poultry feed products” Brooke Dillon a spokesperson for Land O’Lakes the parent company of Purina Animal Nutrition wrote in an email. Similarly Mary Winn Pilkington a spokesperson for Tractor Supply said that its suppliers confirmed there has been “no change to the nutritional profile” of their feed products.

Feed products have been recalled in the past for improper nutrition according to Adam Fahrenholz an associate professor of feed milling at North Carolina State University. But while feed nutrition issues like insufficient protein can reduce egg production he found no merit in online claims of a massive conspiracy.

“I don’t find it plausible from the standpoint of an intentional large scale you know planned event at all” Fahrenholz added.

The conspiracy that feed companies are deliberately trying to sabotage backyard egg supplies found an audience thanks to a broader distrust of government officials and experts said Yotam Ophir an assistant professor at the University at Buffalo who focuses on misinformation. It’s common for people to look for scapegoats during periods of social anxiety he said. The claims join other recent conspiracies alleging a coordinated effort to undermine the nation’s food supply.

“The official narrative is kind of reminding us that we are sometimes vulnerable to the randomness of nature” Ophir said.

The cost of eggs incentivized many homeowners to consider raising backyard chickens with numbers rising from 8 percent to 13 percent in 2022 but there are many other benefits of keeping these social affectionate birds.

If you’re considering bringing egg production in-house our guide to raising chickens is a great place to get some basic information and ideas of what to expect. Among the things you need to raise backyard chickens is space. It takes 3 square feet in the coop and 10 square feet in the run for each chicken. Here’s a list of some additional items you’ll need.

1. Sentinel Chicken Coop

Bedding material provides chickens a soft and comfortable place to sleep. But what is the best bedding for chicken coops? Pine shavings are a good choice since they’re inexpensive absorbent control odors and have natural anti-bacterial properties to keep the coop clean disease-free and compostable. They provide more insulation than straw but can cause plastic nesting boxes to degrade. Premium Pine Shavings from TSC are our top recommendation for large flakes since they have a pleasant aroma and low dust. They’re also absorbent soft and fluff up nicely.

Insoluble grit—often crushed granite—is necessary to help chickens digest their food. Instead of a stomach chickens have gizzards a muscle that grinds up coarse grains for digestion. However it needs the assistance of little stones to help break up the food. Free-range chickens may not need it but pastured hens will benefit from it. Poultry Grit is crushed granite that is sized appropriately for chickens and it can be fed in a separate container or scattered as scratch.

The SPARC plasma plant technology from PyroGenesis Canada Inc which is due to be completed in 2024 will have the capacity to destroy up to 100 tonnes of gases annually.

Currently the Trust for the Destruction of Synthetic Refrigerants collects and pays a bounty for recovered synthetic refrigerants through its Cool-Safe product stewardship programme which are then shipped to an Australian-based specialist destruction plant.

Evolving from PyroGenesis’ plasma platform developed for the US Military SPARC uses high temperature steam plasma to crack CFCs HCFCs HFCs and PFCs.

In a reactor with a temperature of over 1300°C the steam plasma hydrolysis reaction is said to quickly and efficiently break down the waste refrigerant into CO2 and water. The gas stream is then rapidly quenched to prevent any reformation of dioxins and furans. Acid gases generated by the process are readily scrubbed out of the stream and neutralised.

Richard Lauder chair of the Trust for the Destruction of Synthetic Refrigerants says the purchase is an important milestone in New Zealand’s mission to significantly reduce the negative impact from these refrigerants. “Up until now any of the refrigerants that we’ve collected for safe destruction have had to be shipped to Australia which isn’t an ideal solution. That’s meant an increased environmental risk through offshore transportation of the refrigerants associated carbon generation and variable international shipping and destruction costs.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

2022 was a big year for the cruise industry. Not only was it the first full year of sailings after the shut down but it also saw record bookings.

You may be left wondering what's next for the cruise industry? Here are 7 changes that you can expect to see in 2023.

1. Boozy Ice Cream

Image

Margaritaville at Sea teamed up with Tipsy Scoop last month to create two new boozy ice cream flavors that guests can enjoy on the Margaritaville at Sea cruise ship.

The tequila-infused Blue Margarita sorbet and coconut rum-infused Bahama Mama ice creams are both made with Margaritaville Spirits liquor and designed exclusively with the tropical ship in mind.

Until now Virgin Voyages was the only cruise line offering spiked ice cream concoctions however with the news of Icon of the Seas also joining in on the boozy dessert fun in 2024 we think this is a trend that we will see taking over other cruise lines.

2. Ships are all back to 100%

Image

The days of reduced capacity cruise ships are pretty much behind us.

With the cruise industry back up and running you can expect your next cruise ship to be sailing at full capacity.

While it was nice for passengers to have less guests around a less-than-full ship is not practical from a financial viability standpoint and the cruise industry had to get their ships sailing totally full again to maximize profits and make up for all the money lost between 2020-2022.

Image

Last year there were still a few markets that had ships sailing at less than 100% such as the Mediterranean Northern Europe and even Alaska.

Going forward don't expect to see that again.

3. New Destinations

Image

After holding off on travel for the past few years many travelers are wanting to explore new destinations. Cruise lines are taking notice and offering new destinations to their lineup this year.

Disney Wonder will offer the fleet’s first-ever itineraries in the South Pacific. Explora Journeys launching in summer of 2023 is aiming to take cruisers to places that larger cruise ships can’t travel including 138 ports in more than 40 countries.

There has also been an increased trend of travelers utilizing cruise ships for their bucket-list destinations such as Antarctica offered by many different cruise lines. We’re expecting to see this trend continue into 2023 and beyond.

4. Cut backs in offerings

Image

One trend we're seeing early this year is some cruise lines cutting back a bit.

No body likes getting less than they're used to but cruise lines are still in billions dollars of debt from the past few years so trimming their bottom line has become a necessity.

Norwegian Cruise Line in particular has introduced a series of changes along those lines.

Image

NCL's parent company recently laid off about 9% of its shoreside staff. They also hiked their service fees by 25% for passengers in most cabins on January 1st.

They also increased the cost of its Unlimited Open Bar Beverage Package by about 10% to $109.

At the end of 2022 Carnival Cruise Line announced changes to its food and beverage offerings due to inflation higher fuel prices and supply chain challenges.

Image

Specifically in the main dining room free lobster will continue to be offered on cruises lasting six days or more but will be moved to the second elegant evening.

Guests ordering a third entrée in the main dining room will see an additional $5 charge.

Carnival also cut back on offering free ice cream 24 hours a day.

5. Better internet on cruise ships (finally)

Image

With remote work sticking around it’s opened the door for the way people travel and work. Cruising is no exception last year Royal Caribbean began to implement Starlink on their ships with a goal of having it operational on all Royal Caribbean and Celebrity ships by the end of the first quarter in 2023.

In January 2023 Carnival Corporation announced they had also signed an agreement with SpaceX to have Starlink installed on their ships and also on their other brands including Princess Cruises Costa Cruises Holland America Line and more.

Starlink receivers were also spotted on the Norwegian Breakaway in 2022 and while no official comment has been made by either company many expect to see them follow suit as well.

6. Higher prices for a cruise

Image

If there was a silver lining to the cruise industry being shut down it was some of the amazing deals cruise line's were offering but that's a memory now.

Booking a cruise in 2023 will almost certainly cost you more than a cruise you may have booked last year. Cruise fares are going up and the chances of a last-minute deal is far less likely.

Why is this? In short it's because demand for cruises is higher than in the past few years.

Image

Cruise lines are taking note of the higher demand and you're likely seeing higher prices. This is especially true for a cruise later this year. Even 2024 prices are on their way up.

Your best bet is to lock in a price now rather than chancing a lower price later.

7. New Ships

Image

It’s shaping up to be another big year for new cruise ships! Norwegian Cruise Line Virgin Voyages Celebrity Cruises Carnival Cruise Line Regent Seven Seas Cruises Oceania Cruises Silversea Cruises and MSC Cruises are all expected to debut new ships in 2023.

These ships range from holding 728 passengers (Silver Nova) to 6630 (Carnival Jubilee) passengers ensuring that every cruiser will have an ship to fit their needs.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vbmx0aW1lcy5ubC8yMDIzLzAyLzA1L3NjaGlwaG9sLXBhc3NlbmdlcnMtcGF5LWV1My1zdWl0Y2FzZS1mZWUtaGVscC1hdHRyYWN0LXN0YWZmLWJhZ2dhZ2UtY29tcGFuaWVzLXNhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Schiphol passengers could pay €3 suitcase fee to help attract staff baggage companies say,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='nltimes.nl', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2023/02/05/schiphol-passengers-pay-eu3-suitcase-fee-help-attract-staff-baggage-companies-say (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025625E280A0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMib2h0dHBzOi8vbmx0aW1lcy5ubC8yMDIzLzAyLzA1L3NjaGlwaG9sLXBhc3NlbmdlcnMtcGF5LWV1My1zdWl0Y2FzZS1mZWUtaGVscC1hdHRyYWN0LXN0YWZmLWJhZ2dhZ2UtY29tcGFuaWVzLXNhedIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiU2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhsLmNvLnVrL25ld3MvdGhlLWltcG9ydGFuY2Utb2Ytc2hhcmVob2xkZXItdm90aW5nLWhvdy10by1oYXZlLXlvdXItc2F50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The importance of shareholder voting – how to have your say,Important information - This article isn’t personal advice.

Albany Ohio (WOUB) – After a tough loss to the Athens Bulldogs the Alexander Spartans looked to bounce back against the Trimble Tomcats on Saturday winning the game 54-42.

From the opening tip-off all eyes were on Kyler D’Augustino who was on the brink of hitting 2000 career points scored. It appeared that the game was going to go sideways for Alexander as they started off the game with low energy. The game quickly got out of their hands with the Tomcats moving the ball up and down the court with ease with Trimble being up 14-9 after one quarter.

The low energy poured over into the second quarter with the Spartans still in their slow start. The Tomcats continued to extend their lead and made the game further out of the reach of the Spartans. Trimble’s defense held D’Augustino in check holding him to 6 points in the first half and leading 31-19 heading into the locker room.

Halftime adjustments seemed to be all Alexander needed to reset themselves. They came out fast and quickly made history with D’Augustino achieving his goal of 2000 career points to kick off the new half. He helped set the tone for the Spartans to get their momentum going.

With the Spartans rolling into the fourth quarter the Tomcats lost their footing and could not keep up. Trimble got outscored 18-5 and struggled to get the ball into their possession and capitalize on their lead. The might of Alexander became too much for the Tomcats with the Spartans getting a come from behind victory 54-42.

For the Alexander Spartans their next game with have them travel to Pomeroy to take on the Meigs Marauders.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2plcnJ5LWNsYXJrLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTQxMDM4NTIx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jerry Clark Obituary (2023) - Moline IL - Trimble Funeral Home & Crematory - Moline,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/name/jerry-clark-obituary?id=41038521 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9uYW1lL2plcnJ5LWNsYXJrLW9iaXR1YXJ5P2lkPTQxMDM4NTIx0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,,,,,,,

Here's a look at the Atlanta Braves' entire schedule for the 2023 Major League Baseball regular season.

The Atlanta Braves are now less than two months away from Opening Day.

The Braves will open the 2023 regular season in Washington D.C. playing the Nationals. Then they will travel to St. Louis for a three-game series with Cardinals before returning home to host the San Diego Padres and Cincinnati Reds at Truist Park.

For the first time ever the Braves will play a series against each of the other 29 Major League Baseball teams. All 30 teams will play a series against each other for the first time in baseball history. The hope is that it will generate more fan interest as star players from the opposite league will appear at the city's home ballpark every other year. Braves fans will get a chance to see Shohei Ohtani and Mike Trout play in Atlanta in late-July.

The schedule change will also provide help to teams that play in hypercompetitive divisions. The Braves play in an extremely competitive National League East. Both the Braves and the New York Mets won 101 games last year while the third-place Philadelphia Phillies reached the World Series.

The downside to the change is it means that rivals will play each other less. The Mets and Braves used to play a minimum of 18 regular season games against each other. This season they'll play each other 13 times with their final series coming in mid-August. The two rivals will not play each other once over the final month of the season.

Here's a look at the Braves' entire schedule for the 2023 season:

Tim McCreadie the two-time and defending series champion came from the 12th starting spot to finish in second. Brandon Sheppard who started eighth came him in third followed by 14th starting Devin Moran. Tyler Erb completed the top five to earn the Todd Steel Buildings Hard Charger of the Race after he started 21st on the grid.

Thornton started on the outside of the front row and grabbed the lead at the start of the 50-lap main event. He quickly built a sizable lead in the opening laps of the race until Shane Clanton who started alongside Thornton on the front row was able to close the gap and take over the point with eight laps scored.

Clanton would hold the lead until lap 17 when Thornton regained the top spot. At the halfway mark it was Thornton still in front followed by Clanton and Max Blair who was now up to third. Blair then went to second on lap 27 and two laps later took the lead away from Thornton to become the third different leader of the race.

A caution came out with 29 laps complete with Blair out in front. On the restart Thornton swung to the outside as he pressured Blair and completed the pass heading down the backstretch. Thornton then had to withstand two cautions in the waning laps one with nine laps to go and one with just two circuits remaining holding off McCreadie both times.

In Lucas Oil Victory Lane the 32-year driver who continues to be the most consistent driver to start the 2023 season said: “I really didn’t know what to do tire wise. I knew Max [Blair] and Kyle [Strickler] were on softer tires. I told Max to go soft and it lasted a while for him. I didn’t know if there was really a line there in one and two. It was kind of a do or die. I was like I really want to win this pretty bad so I was trying really hard on that restart and it worked. I kept missing the bottom there in three. It was getting tight. Luckily we held them off.”

McCreadie moved into third in the championship chase with his runner-up finish. “This Paylor Motorsports team just keeps battling. One of these days we’ll be able to start near the front maybe and put some pressure on them early so they have to work a little harder than they are working. That’s the way it goes. We keep passing as many cars as we can. They are not going to slow this team down.”

Sheppard who finished second in last year’s championship standings continues to make strides with his new team. “That was typical All-Tech right there. That was a lot of fun. It was tricky and slippery all over the place. You could chase the brown a little bit. It was a good night. We’ve been needing this for sure. That practice night this week helped us a lot. I learned a lot of stuff on the car.”

OXFORD Miss. – Stephanie Jennings Teague of Chicago sees her commitment of $100000 to the Patterson School of Accountancy‘s new building at the University of Mississippi as a means of saying “thank you.”

“It is a way to show a small token of my appreciation to Ole Miss the faculty and staff and the accounting program” said the alumna who earned undergraduate and master’s degrees in accounting in 2011 and 2012 respectively. “This was a great opportunity to give back to the university and the accountancy school for something that will be around for generations to come.

“I hope the long-term impact of my gift will be that it fosters the next generation of students to have a place they can grow individually network and go after their dreams.”

The four-story building featuring 110000 square feet of tiered auditoriums and classrooms study areas conference rooms and more is to be constructed at the corner of University Avenue and Grove Loop overlooking the Grove. Its cost is estimated at more than $75 million.

“The new building plans will take the accountancy program to the next level” Teague said. “Having a stand-alone space which will be one of the first buildings you see while coming onto campus by the Grove will draw even more attention to the school and provide a community place to gather.”

The school offers a bachelor’s degree four master’s degrees and a doctorate in accountancy. The master’s degrees include two new ones in data analytics: Master of Accountancy and Data Analytics and Master of Taxation and Data Analytics.

It is the top accounting school in the SEC and has ranked among the top 10 programs nationally for more than a decade. Big4AccountingFirms.org ranked the Ole Miss program No. 8 in the nation in 2022.

Since graduation Teague has worked 10 years with Tyson Foods where she has had multiple opportunities to further her career in different positions.

“I jumped at all of them” she said. “This led me to relocating six times within a seven-year period living in North Carolina three times Texas Mississippi and currently in Chicago. My career path has taken me down many roads with different roles within various segments of the company.”

The young alumna said she was well prepared by her education at Ole Miss.

“One of the biggest impacts to my career that the Patterson School of Accountancy prepared me for is how to network and build relationships” Teague said. “The events the school hosts that gave me professional exposure to private and public accounting companies and the camaraderie across the students faculty and staff allowed me to hone and develop my soft skill set that is imperative to preparedness in business situations.”

Mark Wilder the school’s dean expressed appreciation for Teague’s gift.

“She is excelling in her career at Tyson Foods and is moving up the corporate ladder very quickly” he said. “It is exciting and inspiring when our young graduates are successful and want to give back generously.”

Teague is group controller over Tyson Food’s Bruss Co. business unit with responsibilities in Chicago and Jacksonville Florida. She manages all the financial and accounting activities for this group.

Besides being responsible for profit and loss statements balance sheets operational/sales/commercial accounting and projections and strategy she is helping drive improvements in processes determine best practices and champion financial transformation using data analytics. She also serves as a business partner while providing insights for the broader team.

At Tyson Teague has also been part of leadership development programs and project teams focused on system integration mergers and acquisitions and financial transformation.

A native of Hickory North Carolina Teague chose Ole Miss after a family member who attended the university encouraged her to visit.

“I fell in love with Ole Miss as soon as I visited” she said. “The feeling of home you get when you drive on campus the atmosphere at baseball games Saturdays in the Grove and the fact that you run into someone you know everywhere you go are just a few of the school’s charms” she said.

Teague traveled an unconventional path to her accounting major. Always interested in science technology engineering and mathematics fields growing up she started college as a pharmacy major. But when taking her first accounting class during her sophomore year she discovered her true passion.

Her professor suggested that she join the School of Accountancy so she took dual classes the rest of the year and then officially switched to accounting her junior year. After graduation she remained on the Oxford campus to earn a master’s degree.

One of the educational opportunities she enjoyed as an undergraduate was studying abroad in London on a course led by professor J Shaw.

“I love to travel and this was an experience that I was glad to have as a part of my education” Teague said. “It was great to see different cultures and see the global reach and connections that the university has.

“As someone who now works for a global company it helped me to relate and want to learn more about different people.”

Available for a limited time these heart-shaped chicken nuggets are a heartfelt way to celebrate the holiday with sweethearts friends and family according to a blog on the company’s website.

“If the way to one’s heart is really through the stomach then Nuggets of Love are must-have this year. There’s no better way to celebrate the season of love than with a heart-shaped chicken nugget” said Colleen Hall senior director of marketing at Tyson brand.

“That’s why we’re making it easier than ever for fans to get their hands on these heart-shaped nuggets with expanded distribution nationwide.”

Nuggets of Love are pre-cooked lightly breaded chicken nuggets made of 100% white meat raised with no antibiotics ever.

For fans wanting additional Valentine’s Day inspiration the Tyson Brand Instagram page will share a variety of Valentine’s-inspired cards. (My favorite so far – which in fairness could be influenced by the -5 ℉ windchill outside – is “My perfect partner warms my heart and preheats the oven.”)

More opportunities for holiday-themed nuggets

Tyson has a history of holiday-themed chicken nuggets. To celebrate Halloween 2022 the company released Tyson Spooky Nuggets shaped like pumpkins bats and ghosts. At the time my colleague called the lack of a national rollout a missed opportunity explaining that “kids love their nuggets and especially those that come in fun shapes. And let’s be honest a lot of adults do too.”

In addition ThanksNuggets made by Perdue Farms combined all the flavors of Thanksgiving into drumstick- and turkey-shaped nuggets.

I agree and although there are plenty of examples of holiday marketing gone wrong – I’m talking about KFC Germany's poorly thought out Kristallnacht promotion – there are lots of opportunities for holiday- and seasonally-themed nuggets.

I hope this is something that we continue to see for future holidays.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNlYXR0bGV0aW1lcy5jb20vYnVzaW5lc3Mvc2VhdHRsZS1iYXNlZC1zZWFmb29kLWdpYW50LXRyaWRlbnQtcmVhY2hlcy1oYWxmLWNlbnR1cnktbWFyay_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Seattle-based seafood giant Trident reaches half-century mark,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.seattletimes.com', port=443): Read timed out.

Beyond Meat's (BYND 4.89%) stock has likely been beyond frustrating for its investors. The stock is down nearly 70% from its high. And while inflation may be partly to blame as consumers focus on buying more affordable basics the alternative meat maker was experiencing problems long before rapidly rising costs caused shoppers to pare down their grocery lists.

Plant-based meat alternatives had a high wall to surmount in getting more than a narrow band of consumers with a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle interested in its product. While also holding a certain appeal to resource conservationists and those concerned with animal welfare upending the $1 trillion meat industry was always going to be a difficult challenge.

So let's see where the plant-based meat alternative might be in three years -- because right now the outlook isn't very promising.

Fast approaching its expiration date

Third-quarter revenue was down 22% from the year-ago period as supermarket sales plummeted and restaurant and other food-service outlets tumbled. Bloomberg recently cited data from market research firm IRI showing the volume of grocery store sales of plant-based meat was down 14% for the 52-week period ending Dec. 4 while restaurant sales were down 9% at the end of November. The article declared meat alternatives were ""just another fad"" that was fizzling out.

Beyond Meat also has losses stretching as far as the eye can see. That includes a gross loss of $14.8 million in the third quarter versus a profit of $23 million last year. Meanwhile operating losses widened to $90 million from $54 million and net losses nearly doubled to $102 million. Even on an adjusted basis losses before interest taxes depreciation and amortization grew to $74 million from $37 million.

With fewer customers buying the burgers and other faux meat products in stores and major restaurant chains dropping their demand too for Beyond Meat's burgers sausages and alt-chicken tenders there seems little to slow the company's decline.

Faux meat everywhere

So what caused Beyond Meat and the rest of the plant-based meat alternative market to turn from the next big thing into a nothingburger? While there indeed was something of a faddish quality to all the hype surrounding the ""fake meat that bleeds"" phenomenon; in reality it is more a niche product.

Those vegetarians and vegans mentioned earlier only account for a tiny fraction of the population or 2% and 0.5% respectively though if supermarkets put the faux meat in the meat case instead of the vegetarian aisle sales tend to jump.

A 2020 study by supermarket giant Kroger (KR -0.06%) and the Plant Based Foods Association found consumers bought 23% more plant-based meats if they were put next to the Angus beef and other real meat (that's where my local supermarket has them) and not beside the traditional veggie burgers.

The other problem for Beyond Meat is the explosion of competition. Kroger for example launched its own line of plant-based products under the Simple Truth Emerge brand as did Hormel Kellogg Tyson Foods Smithfield Foods Perdue and even Amazon. Similar to what happened when meal delivery kits exploded on the scene the zero-moat business was undercut by large well-financed rivals flooding the market with their own brands.

The faux meat industry has became saturated and commoditized. In fact some companies are now shutting down their efforts. Brazilian meat processing giant JBS has already closed its plant-based meat business just two years after starting it.

A dim outlook

This doesn't bode well for Beyond Meat as a publicly traded company. Its stock lost 81% of its value in 2022 it fired a fifth of its workforce and it expects full-year revenue to be down between 9% and 14% year over year to a range of only $400 million to $425 million.

Beyond Meat founder and CEO Ethan Brown told analysts in November that ""a shakeout does appear to be underway and we expect more brands to either retreat or consolidate and a less cluttered playing field to emerge in the midterm.""

That might be a best-case scenario for Beyond Meat. It seems quite possible the faux meat food stock could be one of those shaken out within the next three years if not by going bankrupt then through being acquired. In either case Beyond Meat is an investment fraught with risk and any money bet on the stock will likely be put through a grinder.

The bank's move into CLOs is part of a larger U.S. investment banking expansion strategy.Nathan Denette/The Canadian Press

Bank of Nova Scotia BNS-T is expanding its U.S. credit operation by hiring a New York-based team to launch a structured loan business targeting a US$1-trillion market.

Scotiabank hired four Wall Street executives from Paris-based investment bank Natixis SA to build a U.S. collateralized loan obligation platform. The group will create securities for institutional clients backed by a pool of loans typically non-investment grade debt. Toronto-based Scotiabank has been a significant investor in CLOs for decades and will start originating the structured products later this year.

The new Scotiabank team includes David Williams and Brad Roberts who were co-heads of credit for Natixis in North America alongside head of structured credit sales Sheri Koval and head of structured credit syndication Mark Dodson. Scotiabank declined to comment on the new hires because they haven’t started their jobs at the bank.

The major U.S. banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. dominate the CLO market but a number of smaller investment dealers are significant players in the sector. Natixis ranked 10th among 24 banks for new CLO issuance in 2022 creating US$3.89-billion of securities according to a study by data service Creditflux Ltd.

Scotiabank is a major lender to U.S. businesses which provide the loans that make up CLOs. The bank’s global loan portfolio grew by an average of 31 per cent annually over the past three years to $123-billion at the end of October 2022 versus 12-per-cent growth in Scotiabank’s Canadian loan portfolio over the same period.

The move into CLOs is part of a larger U.S. investment banking expansion strategy. Last year Scotiabank hired investment bankers to cover U.S. health care technology industrial and consumer products companies and scaled up a division that structures and trades corporate equity derivatives.

The CLO market has expanded rapidly over the past five years hitting an estimated US$1.2-trillion in 2022 as institutions such as insurance companies and pension plans increased their holdings.

“Investors have increasingly become comfortable with the robustness of the structure through multiple periods of market volatility most recently during 2020 and any lingering misplaced associations with the poor performance of subprime mortgage [securities] during the global financial crisis have faded” said portfolio manager Pim van Schie at New York-based Neuberger Berman Group LLC in a recent report. “Most importantly CLOs continue to consistently offer a significant yield premium over other corporate credit instruments for an equivalent credit rating.”

Scotiabank is entering the CLO market at a time when central banks are increasing rates to combat inflation raising recession concerns. In a report Deutsche Bank head of CLO origination Brendan Condon said the U.S. Federal Reserve’s moves to bring down inflation are “a double-edged sword for the asset class because while higher interest rates will hit consumers and businesses these may also prompt a significant influx of funds into CLOs as investors switch from fixed to floating rate products something everyone wants in an inflationary environment.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZ0LmNvbS9jb250ZW50LzQ1NjJjM2UzLTMzM2UtNGZmMi05MDg2LTM4NDJhYjRkZjMwZNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Goldman can regain its swagger,"Try unlimited access Only MX$100 for 4 weeks

Scams can wreck their victims' finances credit scores and emotions. Maybe the scariest part of scams is how common they are. For instance in 2022 Americans reportedly lost almost $40 billion dollars to phone scams alone. If you don't want to fall victim to a scam it's wise to learn what to watch out for in 2023. CNBC Select sat down with Micheal Bruemmer VP of Experian Data Breach Resolution and Consumer Protection to talk about the scams that will likely be most prevalent this year — and how you can protect yourself against them.

Scams to be aware of in 2023

Bruemmer breaks down scams into two big categories: phishing and social engineering. Phishing mostly occurs online and involves fraudulent communication purporting to be from reputable sources such as a bank or employer. The scammer attempts to steal your personal data such as credit card information or login credentials for financial accounts. Social engineering on the other hand usually happens over the phone and sometimes in person. Bad actors use psychological manipulation and deception to gain access to your money or confidential information. Here are five types of phishing and social engineering scams Bruemmer thinks will be prevalent this year. 1. Charitable donations scam To get their hands on your money scammers will stoop to any low including exploiting your empathy. Charity scams range from simplistic one-man operations to complex schemes run by registered nonprofits. In either case the money you're rushed to donate doesn't help any cause. Instead it goes straight to the fraudster. This kind of scam can take the form of phishing where a website or email letter looks like it's from a legitimate organization. More often however a scammer will use social engineering and approach you over the phone or in person to play on your emotions. Don't allow people to prey on your generosity. Research any organization before donating and look for the Employer Identification Number (EIN) on the nonprofit's website to ensure the money is going to the right place. Don't miss: Here's how to donate your credit card rewards to charity 2. Romance scams Another social engineering scam that can leave you not only in financial ruin but also heartbroken is a romance scam. These scams aren't always as elaborate as Netflix's ""The Tinder Swindler"" and most of them happen online. The criminal meets you on a dating or social media app sweeps you off your feet and tries to get into a relationship with you quickly. They're experts at appearing caring sincere and downright perfect. One common sign of a romance scammer is that they probably live far away and make plans to meet you in person — but never will. Instead they'll ask you for money to pay for unexpected medical bills or to get them out of trouble. Usually they'll instruct you to wire money or put it on a gift card. They might keep asking you for money repeatedly until you stop sending it at which point the love of your online life will disappear. Victims of romance scams often find themselves in debt legal trouble and with serious trust issues. To avoid falling for a dangerous fake go slowly in any kind of online romance and don't feel bad about thoroughly researching the person — especially if they seem perfect. ""If it is too good to be true… it's probably a scam"" Bruemmer says. 3. Fitness and weight loss scams It's human nature to want spectacular results with minimal effort especially when it comes to fitness goals. But scammers are taking advantage of people's desire to shed a few pounds to try and make their bank accounts lighter as well. On the phishing side you might come across a fake website posing as a legitimate site that promotes some kind of fitness program. The goal is usually to get you to provide your personal or financial information. Alternatively someone might try to persuade you to sign up for a low-priced gym membership or a different fitness product promising ""you can get 100 pounds off in three weeks and look like new because of the program… for which you have to provide your personal details and credit card"" Bruemmer says. The bottom line here is if something seems too cheap or too good to be true exercise caution and run far away from it. 4. Car warranty scams You know a scam is prevalent when it becomes a meme. You have probably seen pictures or videos online making fun of phone calls ""trying to reach you about your car's extended warranty."" After all this is one of the most common robocalls Americans get. ""I have a software app on my phone that blocks calls"" Bruemmer shares. ""I got seven calls for extended car warranty [last week] because they try to leave a voicemail."" If you're also ignoring these calls then keep up the good work. Otherwise you'll most likely be prompted to provide personal or financial information. Or the fraudster might try to sell you a fake extended auto warranty defrauding you out of thousands of dollars. For that reason when you pick up the phone and hear a pre-recorded message about your car warranty simply hang up. If you think that might be your car dealership calling you you can call them back using their official number to double-check. 5. Gift card scams According to a last year's survey from AARP 26% of U.S. consumers received a gift card with no funds on it. What gives? There are a couple of ways scammers can drain a gift card's balance before you use it. They might for instance take cards off the store rack tamper with the protective strips and steal the bar codes. The fraudster buys similar security tape and replaces the strips to make the card look untouched. Then they enter the card's code into a program that tracks the retailer's website and informs the scammer when someone buys the card so they can spend the money on it or cash it. As a result by the time the card makes it to its recipient it's a worthless piece of plastic. Other fraudsters advertise gift card exchange websites or sites that offer to check your gift card balance. You're prompted to input your gift card information which the scammer then uses to drain the card's balance. When buying a gift card take a close look at it to ensure it hasn't been tampered with — and only buy from reputable resellers. Don't miss: Did you receive a gift card you don't need? Here's how to sell it for cash

How to protect yourself from scams

Scammers can be inventive and extremely persuasive. Luckily you can follow a few guidelines to avoid getting caught in their schemes. Here's what Bruemmer recommends: Don't use a debit card A debit card is linked directly to your checking account and in some cases your savings and other accounts. Debit cards don't offer the same consumer protections credit cards do. Once someone steals your money it might be difficult to get it back. For that reason it's best to use credit cards for most transactions. The Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA) protects you against credit card fraud and limits your maximum liability to $50 though many card issuers expand that law by offering $0 fraud liability on unauthorized charges. Besides you can also earn rewards with a credit card. For example the Chase Freedom Unlimited® CNBC Select's top pick for the best cash-back credit card earns 6.5% cash back on travel purchased through Chase Travel 4.5% cash back on drugstore purchases and dining at restaurants (including takeout and eligible delivery service) and 3% on all other purchases (on up to $20000 spent in the first year).

Be careful about letting your credit card out of your sight When you give someone your card it's all too easy for them to use a skimming device which reads the magnetic strip of your card and stores the card's information. While it's unrealistic to expect the waitstaff at your favorite restaurant to let you hop in the back and swipe your own card try to minimize the times someone swipes it out of your sight. ""If they're going to run it through a machine it should be in front of your eyes"" Bruemmer says. Only click links you trust Since fraudsters are getting very creative in masking their phishing attempts treat every link you get with suspicion. ""My rule of thumb is if somebody is going to send me something that they want me to click on they need to call me and say 'Hey Mike this is what I'm sending you. This is the link it's legit"" Bruemmers says. To spot phishing check where the message is coming from — if it's claiming to be from a reputable company but sent from a generic Gmail email address or an address that has subtle misspellings (like ""amaz0n"" instead of ""amazon"") it's probably a scam. Additionally watch out for bad grammar or emails threatening you or urging you to take action. For example a scammer might say your bank account is about to be blocked and provide a link you need to click to avoid it. Always err on the side of caution when it comes to links and attachments. If you have doubts about whether or not an email or text is a phishing attempt get in touch with the actual company that's supposedly sent it using their official communication channels. Monitor your credit If you've become a victim of fraud you might discover it on your credit report as new accounts you haven't opened or addresses you don't recognize. While nobody likes to see they've been swindled the earlier you detect the crime the sooner you can do something about it. To keep an eye on your credit you can get a free credit report once a year from each bureau at AnnualCreditReport.com (due to the pandemic you can get free reports weekly through December 2023) or sign up for a credit monitoring service. While free credit monitoring services such as Experian Dark Web Scan + Credit Monitoring can cover the basics you receive more comprehensive coverage if you put down some money. For example IdentityForce® UltraSecure and UltraSecure+Credit offers three-bureau credit monitoring and track your information on various sites and services including the dark web court records and social media.

Don't answer phone calls from unrecognized numbers With scammers sometimes all it takes is you picking up the phone and saying a few words for fraud to happen. Bruemmer says that he's set up his phone so that all calls from numbers outside of his contact list go straight to voicemail. ""Even [when you're] saying hello and your name someone can grab a voiceprint and use that as a second factor of authentication with a financial institution or to authorize a transaction"" he explains.

Bottom line

With scams getting elaborate and preying on every facet of human nature it may feel as though your financial well-being is at constant risk. Luckily you can protect yourself from most scams by just staying vigilant and cautious. If someone you don't know is urging you to make a financial decision in a rush question their motives. If something seems too good to be true listen to your gut. Remember: damage from identity fraud and financial scams is much easier to prevent than fix.

Whether it's Beyoncé George Strait or the Rolling Stones the Twin Cities get the big shows. And they're greeted with big enthusiasm because Minnesotans love their melodies.

Legendary Minneapolis record shop Electric Fetus is a store that legends themselves have frequented.

""Prince was a regular shopper Joe Walsh Sting Shaggy"" said store owner Keith Covart.

Ringo Starr even repped the store at the 2009 Grammy's. While there's a shared love of records at this famous shop there's another preferred way to consume music too.

""You can listen to the artist's music on your computer but you go to the concert for an experience"" Covart said.

Music lover Ann Dunne makes it her job to make sure other music lovers in Minnesota get to see their favorite acts. As assistant general manager at U.S. Bank Stadium she books the concerts. Dunne says the process starts with the artist and their managers who decide to tour then go to a promoter who will then go to her – or she will pitch to them.

Dunne explains how the stadium landed Eric Church for his sold-out show back in June.

""We went to their artist management and their promoter and said 'Hey we would love to have this very special show here at U.S. Bank Stadium.' And they were like 'Yeah let's do it'"" Dunne said.

The amount they can sell depends on what venue they choose. An arena like Xcel Energy or the Target Center may sell about 20000. A stadium can sell up to 70000 like the Garth Brooks shows.

Beyoncé at the 65th annual Grammy Awards Chris Pizzello

Speaking of big sellers just how did Dunne and crew get Taylor Swift to commit to two shows in Minneapolis?

""We have a really strong relationship with her promotor and this is one of her favorite places to play"" she said. "" We always had a first night and when the demand was there we were asked if we had availability for a second night and we said 'Of course we do [laughs]!'""

And that's the hope – that artists will want to return. That's why venues make elaborate Minnesota welcomes; like an artist-created poster for Beyoncé that ties her music to the Twin Cities; a welcome wall created for Kenny Chesney that was an ode to his oceanside lifestyle; and a wall made for the Rolling Stones that featured photos from all of their Minnesota shows. It was a gesture the legendary rockers praised on Instagram.

""They really kind of love that little extra touch that we give them to welcome here"" Dunne said.

So in the end it's all about showing them that Minnesota really is nice.

As for ticket prices the artist's team determines the price. Often if it's a bigger-name act the ticket price will be higher."

His loved ones came together at TY Park in Hollywood across from where the teen was shot late last year.

The 19-year-old was shot while taking an Uber ride.

He was in the hospital for 71 days before he died.

His mother April McGlashan said her son miles made his mark in a short time and that he was her only child.

“He would just tell me that he loved me every day” she said.

McGlashan’s family is frustrated over the lack of an arrest but the case is being investigated by the Hollywood Police Department.

In November McGlashan hailed an Uber to his grandparents’ home in Hollywood near TY Park.

Detectives say there was some sort of argument over a drop off location.

McGlashan had exited the rideshare and allegedly slammed the door after which the driver got out and an argument ensued.

That’s when the driver who Local 10 News identified as 51-year-old Christopher Bernadel fatally shot McGlashan.

Police called McGlashan the aggressor after Bernadel claimed self-defense.

McGlashan has no criminal record and his family does not believe he was the aggressor.

The teen could never tell police his side of the story because after 71 days in the ICU on life support he died.

Bernadel has not been charged in the shooting.

McGlashan’s family says he was not the fighting type and want accountability for his death.

Family attorney David Kubiliun said the teen was shot in the back and the bullet exited his chest.

He is asking police at the State Attorney’s office when a charging decision will be made.

“Right now we are waiting on the Hollywood Police Department and the State Attorney’s office to make a decision on if they are going to file charges” he said.

McGlashan’s mother is anxiously waiting on that decision.

“I feel that Uber not only Uber but the driver has to be held accountable” she said.

A friend who got a tattoo of two “M’s” in honor of Miles’ initials told Local 10 News that he thinks about him every day.

“I really grew a bond with him and I went to college and didn’t get to see him as much” he said. “Once I heard this it was really hard for me to find out and I thought of a way I could remember him every day.”

Hollywood police said detectives will take what they have and present it to the State Attorney’s office.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMibGh0dHBzOi8vY2FsZ2FyeWhlcmFsZC5jb20vbmV3cy9sb2NhbC1uZXdzL2NhbGdhcnktaW50ZXJuYXRpb25hbC1haXJwb3J0LWFsbG93cy11YmVyLXBpY2t1cHMtYXQtYXJyaXZhbHMtem9uZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Calgary International Airport allows Uber pickups at arrivals zone,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='calgaryherald.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/local-news/calgary-international-airport-allows-uber-pickups-at-arrivals-zone (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025628FEEA40>, 'Connection to calgaryherald.com timed out.

The move is part of a global strategy for the minicab platform operator to boost profitability for shareholders as growth slows. Uber is progressively moving from a transparent fare and pay structure based on time distance and commission to one that is variable opaque and algorithmically controlled. However the technology push will place vulnerable customers at risk of not being able to book the service when they most need it and drivers will be at even more risk of unfair exploitation.

A recent Harvard University study – Dynamic Pricing Algorithms Consumer Harm and Regulatory Response – has warned of the danger to consumers of tacit collusion between the algorithms of competing firms. Tacit collusion can occur where the pricing & pay algorithms of competing firms anticipate and respond to the actions of the other in the marketplace in real time. There may be no overt collusion but the effect of tacit collusion may be even more damaging to consumers and workers. The Harvard academic authors have called for a robust regulatory response to the growing problem.

In the case of consumers vulnerable passengers travelling home late at night or elderly passengers travelling to hospital appointments may find themselves directly or indirectly targeted unfairly for higher prices. Drivers may also be targeted based on their willingness and ability to accept lower fares which yield below the minimum wage. In both scenarios competing algorithms are monitoring market signals as well as the behaviour of customers and drivers in real time. As a result passengers are offered prices at higher rates than they might otherwise be. In the same way driver pay is kept artificially lower with drivers being effectively black and grey listed in the workplace.

In recent financial results Uber’s margins have improved because of the roll out of this dangerous technology. The firm has also weaponized inflation to raise fares for consumers but failing to pass on gains to drivers who are most exposed to fuel and other operating cost increases.

Although Uber has updated its privacy policy in December 2022 the company fails to properly disclose how driver and customer data is processed by dynamic pricing and Uber also fails to provide algorithmic transparency when data subject access requests are made by drivers despite a legal requirement to do so according to the Data Protection Act.

To make matters worse the government’s forthcoming post-Brexit Data Protection and Digital Information Bill plans to strip consumers and workers of valuable protections against unfair automated decision making by algorithms. Government deregulation will relieve operators such as Uber from the responsibility to consult stakeholders & conduct risk assessments and gives platforms greater powers to refuse data access and algorithmic transparency requests. In short the government’s planned relaxation of data protection rules will make consumers and workers to algorithmic predation on pay and will permit algorithms to even sack workers.

Uber is obliged by regulation to clear all business model changes with Transport for London before implementation. It beggars belief that the Mayor and TfL would have agreed to the introduction of technologies so harmful to consumers and TfL licensed minicab drivers but that appears to be exactly what has happened.

The ADCU is staging a demonstration against TfL to demand action against Uber’s dynamic pricing model on Tuesday February 7 at 11am at TfL’s Palestra House London SE1 8NJ.

James Farrar ADCU General Secretary said:

“The Mayor and Transport for London have failed in their duty when they haver Uber the green light to set loose such dangerous and predatory algorithms in what is supposed to be a closely regulated market. Passengers and drivers are directly and indirectly unfairly targeted for personal auto-exploitation. Vulnerable passengers are placed at risk when service is denied or unfairly priced while driver pay is unfairly held down by means of employer tacit collusion and with individuals targeted for black and grey listing. In post Brexit Britain where the government plans to strip away the few protections we have against algorithmic abuse the Mayor must step now forward and insist on high standards of data protection for London passengers and workers. We call on the Mayor to immediately ban the use of dynamic pricing algorithms in the regulated London minicab market.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9pcmwvbWNkb25hbGRzLWNob2NvbGF0ZS1taWxrLWZyZWUtdWJlci1lYXRzL9IBSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRhaWx5ZG90LmNvbS9pcmwvbWNkb25hbGRzLWNob2NvbGF0ZS1taWxrLWZyZWUtdWJlci1lYXRzLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘This happened to me on DoorDash’: Customer says McDonald’s accidentally listed their chocolate milk for free on Uber Eats orders 13,"Glitches in food apps seem to be more common lately from a woman who accidentally ordered 10 slices of cheese at Chick-fil-A to one where Chick-fil-A piled a woman’s sandwich with pickles. In a viral TikTok a man claims McDonald’s accidentally listed their chocolate milk as “free” on Uber Eats resulting in him ordering 13.

The video was uploaded by TikTok user Mesean (@meseans) where he revealed a plastic bag full of small chocolate milk bottles.

“Me when mcdonald’s accidentally lists their chocolate milk for free on uber eats” he wrote in the overlay text zooming in on all the mini bottles.

The Daily Dot reached out to Mesean via TikTok comment and Uber Eats via press email regarding the video. The video garnered over 782000 views as of Saturday where many viewers claimed it brought back childhood memories.

“These just taste like childhood roadtrips omg” one viewer said.

“Those are so good you just made me remember this I haven’t had one since I was a child” another echoed.

“Like fr I haven’t it in years as a kid tho” a third agreed.

Some proposed the reason why the chocolate milk might have been listed as ‘free’ with one user speculating they were probably about to expire.

“They do that because they aren’t selling fast enough and there going to expire usually” one user suggested.

“I swear these are always sold 2 days before they expire” a second wrote.

“Better check expo.. my daughters is always expired in her happy meal” a third recommended.

Others shared their experiences with ordering “free” food on delivery apps.

“One time Buffalo Wild Wings glitched and I got 200 wings for 99 cents for a party lolol” one person shared.

“I remember this one time like at 3am I went on DoorDash and went to I hop and this breakfast thing was free with pancakes n everything” a second commented.

“That happened to me on doordash with the kids meals lol I ordered like 5” a third stated.

Uber Eats offers different discounts and promos on their app some being Spend $20 and save $5 get a free food item when you spend $20 and more. However it is unclear whether there was a glitch resulting in free food or if McDonald’s was attempting to get rid of the product.

Last year DoorDash had this issue where people were placing orders without being charged. There were customers who were ordering items in bulk thus leaving customers eventually charged hundreds and others thousands of dollars.

As one user put it “the back charge is gonna be CRAZY.”"

Lizzo has officially arrived and she came to this year's awards wearing a monochromatic orange eyeshadow look to complement her Dolce & Gabbana gown. For a deep orange hue similar to the “About Damn Time” singer's we recommend playing around with the three shades of orange found in the Huda Beauty Color Block Obsessions Eyeshadow Palette. The palette purports to be designed with all skin tones in mind to create a variety of subtle and dramatic eye looks.

3. Laverne Cox's shimmering gold lip

""All that glitters is gold"" and Laverne Cox turned that statement into a reality. From her gold chrome nails to her eyeshadow the Orange is the New Black star came glowing in gold. The subtle gleam of gold on her lips is arguably the shining star of this look and you can easily recreate this effect at home with a dusting of a powdered highlighter such as the Rare Beauty Positive Light Silky Touch Highlighter in the shade ""Flaunt"" (true gold). It promises to deliver an an ""instant glass-like sheen for an easy natural-looking glow that lasts."" Our beauty editor Jessica Kasparian confirmed its versatile nature over on Reviewed's beauty TikTok channel Beautorial by brushing it over her eyelids.

4. Bebe Rexha's voluminous blowout

Bebe Rexha's layered blowout has us swooning over here and one product that can certainly achieve a style of this magnitude is the Reviewed-approved Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer and Volumizer. It promises ""to deliver gorgeous volume and brilliant shine in a single step."" When Kasparian put the styling tool to the test she reported that ""you can dry your hair from root to tip and customize your 'do to have more or less volume and curls inward or outward at the ends.""

5. Shania Twain's red lipstick

The “Man! I Feel Like a Woman” singer appears to have taken some cues from Cruella De Vil's wardrobe and let's just say you don't need a black-and-white ensemble and a red wig to channel the energy of Shania Twain's look for the night. In our opinion all you really need is a red statement lip that you can easily recreate with the help of the Reviewed-approved Wet N Wild MegaLast Liquid Catsuit Matte Lipstick in ""Missy Fierce"" (dark red).

It claims to glide onto lips like a gloss but dries down into a matte finish. Teich also put some of the most popular liquid lipsticks to the test and arrived at Wet N Wild's as being the best. ""The lipstick is lightweight and so smoothing it almost looked like it filled in any lines on my lips instead of settling into them like most liquid lipsticks"" she recalled of her experience in her review.

Steakhouse Cheeseburger On United Airlines – Yea Or Nay?

United Airlines promises that improvements to its onboard catering are coming and they cannot come soon enough to Polaris Business Class. When it comes to domestic cabins though I find the current selections are very much hit or miss. While the chicken curry is not fit for (imaginary) dog the burgers are usually a safe choice. Last month I wrote about the delicious bacon cheeseburger that was simply sublime. Yes sublime.

I actually pre-ordered the smoked five spice tofu bowl (side note – I am trying to reduce red meat consumption this year and trying to develop an appreciation for tofu. I’m not sure if airline tofu is the way to accomplish this but I figured I’d try one).

Well that was not catered. Instead a steakhouse cheeseburger was loaded which was described as a “steakhouse burger with cheddar cheese and peppercorn sauce.” The meal was served with a grain salad bread roll and cookie…talk about a carb overload.

The burger was very good and I did eat the pretzel bun (leaving the other carbs on the plate) which adds a lot to it. I do not think the cheese was cheddar though – it looked and tasted more like Monterey Jack cheese.

My suggestion to United: add a fresh green salad and bowl of fruit to every domestic meal. It’s simple but people love it. I brought my own salad from the grab-and-go lounge and enjoyed it onboard with the burger.

Anyway the burger was very nice. I do recommend it among the other options though I will try again for the tofu bowl next time.

Have you tried the steakhouse cheeseburger?

""What does resilience mean? It means we will plan conservatively and pivot quickly. It means we will balance defensive and offensive mode and it means we will execute what we call our wildly important initiatives. ""Specifically we will balance efficiency moves with growth opportunities. Think of that as better and bolder. We will stop certain initiatives and accelerate others thereby increasing investment in our business. Relative to 2022 we are increasing our 2023 expense and capital budget by over $900 million. Finally we will focus on three widely important initiatives - improving the customer value proposition increasing talent development and employee engagement and leveraging our physical network with our digital platform to drive logistics-as-a-service"" Tome said last week during an analysts call after Q42022 results were announced. UPS reported a 3 percent decline in Q42022 revenue at $27 billion on 3 percent increase in domestic package revenue and 8 percent drop in international package revenue. Consolidated operating profit was $3.2 billion down 17.9 percent compared to the fourth quarter of 2021 and down 3.3 percent on an adjusted basis. For the full year 2022 consolidated revenue increased 3 percent to $100.3 billion and adjusted operating profit was up 5 percent at $13.9 billion. The company returned $8.6 billion of cash to shareowners through dividends and share buybacks.

Carol Tome Chief Executive Officer UPS

""For the past two and a half years we have fundamentally improved nearly every aspect of our business and we're just getting started"" says Tome. ""Uncertainty creates opportunity and this team has proven that it's up for the challenge.""

Focus on digital

Tome highlighted the success with Digital Access Programme (DAP) ""making it easier for SMB customers to do business with UPS. In 2022 we generated more than $2.3 billion in DAP revenue exceeding our targets. We expect the momentum to continue and plan to generate around $3 billion in global DAP revenue in 2023."" Dynamic pricing gained momentum at UPS with the launch of Deal Manager in 2022. ""Deal Manager digitises the pricing process and applies pricing science to present the right offer to our SMB customers the first time so we are able to close deals faster and with better revenue quality. In 2022 our U.S. win rate with Deal Manager was 22 percentage points higher than the baseline. So we are moving quickly to expand access to Deal Manager to more than 40 countries in 2023"" says Tome. Healthcare to be $10bn biz

The healthcare portfolio of UPS reached $9.2 billion and ""our goal is to become the number one complex healthcare logistics provider in the world. Today we have nearly 17 million square feet of healthcare compliance distribution space globally with leading cold chain logistics capabilities. In 2023 we expect our healthcare portfolio to generate more than $10 billion in revenue"" says Tome. UPS is now selling more into biologics and some of the developing treatments adds Kate Gutmann EVP International Healthcare and Supply Chain Solutions. ""So that continues to fuel us for future growth. We've seen double-digit growth and we're planning for double-digit growth this year as well with very strong margins."" Amazon biz to slide

UPS finished 2022 with Amazon accounting for 11.3 percent of its business according to Newman down from 11.7 percent in 2021 - ""a dcline of about 40 basis points. We'll continue on a mutually agreed path to glide that business down in 2023 and that's factored into our guide. So we feel good about being able to manage that down."" Tome clarified that the planned decline to 11 percent by 2022 was impacted by foreign exchange. ""FX impacted our top line by $1.3 billion. So having not had the pressure on the top line the percentage would have been different."" 2023 outlook

A new growth platform - logistics-as-a-service - was created in 2022 Tome says ""which combines digital capabilities with our best-in-class global integrated network. Under this platform we launched our Delivery Density Solution where we continue to add customers and are seeing positive results."" For the full year 2023 UPS expects revenue to be between $97-99.4 billion capital expenditures to be about $5.3 billion dividend payments to be around $5.4 billion and share repurchases to be around $3 billion.

Brian Newman Chief Financial Officer UPS

UPS expects 2023 to be a bumpy year ""due to rising interest rates decades high inflation recession forecasts a war in Eastern Europe Covid disruptions in China and our U.S. labour negotiations"" says CFO Brian Newman.""While we anchor our plans to S&P Global economic forecasts we have developed multiple plans scenarios that will help us quickly pivot in an uncertain macro environment.""

More than half of the operating profit is coming in the second half of the year adds Newman.

(2023 Updated),"Publix Super Markets has transformed the grocery business since George W. Jenkins opened the first store in 1930.

Started in Winter Haven Florida Jenkins moved the company’s headquarters to nearby Lakeland in 1951.

Today Publix has nearly 1300 stores in the southeastern United States spanning from Florida into Georgia and Alabama along with Tennessee Virginia and both Carolinas.

But do they rent carpet cleaners?

Does Publix Rent Carpet Cleaners?

Yes Publix does have carpet cleaners for rent at most of their locations.

Their availability may be limited and some stores may not carry all of the attachments for the machines.

You may want to call your nearby store to confirm availability.

The fee varies by location but it averages around $30-$35 for a 24-hour loan.

Bring along your ID for the rental.

You should see the available carpet cleaners in a kiosk in the area near Customer Service or perhaps close to the Pharmacy.

If unsure where to go ask any of the associates.

The associate at Customer Service can get the process started.

At many stores this involves filling out a one-page form showing your ID selecting the cleaner you wish and any attachments getting the necessary cleaning fluid and paying the carpet cleaner rental fee.

Remember that some states will charge sales tax on your loan since it may be considered a taxable service under the law.

After inspecting the equipment and completing the paperwork you are ready to go.

Checking Online For A Carpet Cleaner At Publix

Internet-savvy shoppers may want to do their research online before heading to their nearby Publix.

Rather than go to the Publix website they should visit the rental location page at the Rug Doctor site.

After getting to this site all one needs to do is enter their ZIP Code.

They may also search for the type of carpet cleaning equipment they want to rent if they wish by selecting from the drop-down menu.

This search option shows Publix locations with Rug Doctor equipment available.

The search results may include other businesses that rent Rug Doctor machines but we need not worry about them at this time since we want to learn about carpet rental equipment available at Publix.

Besides in most cases the results for Publix include the icon indicating that these locations have the “Newest Carpet Machines.”

Click on the “More Information” tab to get the details about machines available at a particular store.

For example if you live near the Publix in Madeira Beach Florida you have certain equipment options to rent.

Those selections are different than if you shop at a Publix in Smyrna Georgia.

Be sure to check the “Offers” tab for discount coupons on machine rentals or cleaning fluids.

After confirming that a Publix near you has the equipment you wish to rent head to the store find the Rug Doctor kiosk talk with a Customer Service representative have your ID in hand and you will have your Rug Doctor rental ready to use.

Although products vary by location there are some popular options found at many locations.

These include outdoor machines as well as ones for carpets and indoor floors.

Some Publix stores may also have optional attachments for rent such as those helpful for deep cleaning upholstery.

The Pro Deep Cleaner is a popular machine that many Publix customers rent.

Others are the X3 Carpet Cleaner and the Pro Portable Detailer & Spot Cleaner.

Many customers also select one of the floor dryers that expedites the drying of carpets and also proves handy for removing moisture after plumbing situations and helping recently painted surfaces dry quickly.

In addition to the machine remember to purchase the appropriate carpet cleaning fluid to get the most out of your Rug Doctor rental from Publix.

The Fresh Spring Scent is offered in many Publix stores with the 96 fluid ounce bottle covering approximately four rooms or 720 square feet.

Do your math before renting the machine so you have purchased an appropriate amount of cleaning fluid to meet your needs.

If you have any questions after bringing the Rug Doctor that you rented from Publix back to your house the company offers a variety of helpful videos on the company’s YouTube page.

Things To Remember Before Returning The Equipment to Publix

As you plan to use the equipment you rented from Publix remember a few important things.

In nearly all cases a 24-hour rental means just that: not from Monday at 8am until Tuesday at 8pm.

Additional fees may apply if you return the equipment later than required.

If you have any questions be sure to check with the Publix representative before leaving the store with the equipment.

You should also return the Rug Doctor equipment in the same condition in which it was when you borrowed it from your neighborhood Publix.

If you return it with the insides dirty and the outside dusty expect to pay an additional fee upon return.

Clean out the tank remove any debris or remaining solution clear dirt and items from the brush and wipe the exterior of the Rug Doctor that you rented.

When you return the machine to the area by the kiosk be prepared for a Publix associate to inspect the machine.

Let this Publix employee know if you have experienced any problems with the machine so they can have it set aside for maintenance or repair if necessary.

Should You Buy A Machine Rather Than Renting One At Publix?

You may ask yourself if it makes more sense to purchase a carpet cleaner rather than rent one at Publix.

Ultimately the decision depends on your financial situation the frequency you would use the machine and your comfort with taking ownership of a machine that may require service and maintenance in the future.

Renting requires you to set aside time to get the Rug Doctor use it within a 24-hour window and return it to Publix in a similar condition.

Purchasing a similar machine from Rug Doctor or elsewhere costs more up-front but allows you to clean the carpet without worrying about rushing it back to Publix before the deadline.

A third option involves hiring an outside company to bring their equipment to your home.

Consider your options check your checkbook and find the best way to keep those carpets clean.

Nine Other Reasons To Add Publix To Your Shopping List

S&P Global is a financial company best known as the creator of the S&P 500 index which is widely regarded as a benchmark for the entire U.S. stock market due to its diverse nature. Last year economic uncertainty arising from red-hot inflation and rising interest rates caused the S&P 500 to fall into a bear market and the index is still 15% off its high.

Not surprisingly many growth stocks have fallen even more sharply simply because growth stocks are usually valued based on future revenue and free cash flow and those metrics tend to look quite grim during periods of economic hardship. As a result the S&P 500 Growth index -- another product curated by S&P Global -- is currently 27% off its high.

However investors should be aware of two things: First the S&P 500 has suffered dozens of bear markets in the past but the index has always recouped its losses during the next bull market. Second while growth stocks have sharply over the past year the S&P 500 Growth index has still outperformed the S&P 500 over the past one two and three decades.

With that in mind here is one index fund to buy now and hold forever.

Buy all the growth stocks in the S&P 500

The Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF (VOOG) tracks the S&P 500 Growth index meaning it provides exposure to all of the growth stocks in the S&P 500. Specifically the Vanguard ETF measures the performance of 230 stocks that span all 11 market sectors though the technology and healthcare sectors account for more than half of its weight.

The top 10 holdings in the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF are listed below.

Apple: 11.6% Microsoft: 6.2% Alphabet: 6% UnitedHealth Group: 3% ExxonMobil: 2.7% Nvidia: 2.2% Amazon: 2.1% Visa: 2% Tesla: 2% Chevron: 1.9%

The Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF comes with one big advantage over individual stocks: It allows investors to instantly build a relatively diversified portfolio that requires very little oversight. As a caveat the S&P 500 Growth index is less diverse than the broader S&P 500 simply because it excludes value stocks. That means the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF is prone to greater volatility than an S&P 500 index fund such as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEMKT: VOO).

However volatility works both ways. The tech-heavy composition of the S&P 500 Growth index has been the driving force behind its long-term outperformance. While the broad-based S&P 500 is up 169% over the past decade the S&P 500 Growth index is up 212% meaning it produced an annualized return of 12% over the last 10 years.

Assuming the same rate of return $100 invested weekly in the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF would be worth about $91200 in one decade $374600 in two decades and $1.2 million in three decades. That said expecting 12% annually over a 30-year time period is probably a bit optimistic but the S&P 500 Growth index has undeniably outperformed the S&P 500 over the last 10- 20- and 30-year periods so investors can reasonably assume growth stocks will continue to outperform in the long run. That makes the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth ETF a particularly attractive option for risk-tolerant investors.",,,,,,,,,

We're Demoralized by Our Health System. (Published 2023),"Doctors have long diagnosed many of our sickest patients with “demoralization syndrome” a condition commonly associated with terminal illness that’s characterized by a sense of helplessness and loss of purpose. American physicians are now increasingly suffering from a similar condition except our demoralization is not a reaction to a medical condition but rather to the diseased systems for which we work.

The United States is the only large high-income nation that doesn’t provide universal health care‌ to its citizens. Instead it maintains a lucrative system of for-profit medicine. For decades ‌at least tens of thousands of preventable deaths have occurred each year because health care here is so expensive.

During the Covid-19 pandemic the consequences of this policy choice have intensified. One study estimates at least 338000 Covid deaths in the United States could have been prevented by universal health care. In the wake of this generational catastrophe many health care workers have been left shaken.

“For me doctoring in a broken place required a sustaining belief that the place would become less broken as a result of my efforts” wrote Dr. Rachael Bedard about her decision to quit her job at New York City’s Rikers Island prison complex during the pandemic. “I couldn’t sustain that belief any longer.”‌",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb3YuY2EuZ292LzIwMjMvMDIvMDUvaWN5bWktY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1hbm5vdW5jZWQtNDAwLW1pbGxpb24taW4tZ3JhbnRzLXRvLWludmVzdC1pbi1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS13b3JrZm9yY2UtaW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,ICYMI: California Announced $400+ Million in Grants to Invest in Health Care Workforce & Infrastructure | California ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMihQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5nb3YuY2EuZ292LzIwMjMvMDIvMDUvaWN5bWktY2FsaWZvcm5pYS1hbm5vdW5jZWQtNDAwLW1pbGxpb24taW4tZ3JhbnRzLXRvLWludmVzdC1pbi1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS13b3JrZm9yY2UtaW5mcmFzdHJ1Y3R1cmUv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025627791A80>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

You will certainly notice it when you get in.

When she has no blazer hanging on the coat rack a large rosary takes up that space. Behind it there is a table with a statue of Mary a rosary a Bible and a crucifix. This a sign that most decisions she makes be it in her family or in the ministry are driven by her Christian background.

“This is where I start my day. I pray for protection guidance and wisdom in all that I do throughout the day. When I get into the office I ask God to protect me and before I leave the office I also thank God for the day. It is my favourite place in my office” she says.

Ms Nakhumicha had a sat down with Saturday Nation’s Angela Oketch and spoke about Kenya Kwanza government’s universal health coverage plan changes at the National Health Insurance Fund and cartels at Afya House often called the ‘Mafya.’

Who is Susan Nakhumicha?

I am a mother and a professional in the health sector. I did a degree in pharmacy and a Master’s in supply chain management. I have been in the health space for the longest.

I began at the very bottom which was dispensing drugs at the chemist I then moved to the hospital setting still behind the window dispensing. My last position as a pharmacist was at AAR Kisumu where I was in charge.

I then joined Mission for Essential Drugs and Supplies (MEDS) where I worked in operations and moved to the supply chain. I have worked in a number of hospitals dealing with sourcing health suppliers and commodities and then I transited and joined global programmes as the health of supply chain. I was then plucked and brought to the ministry.

You head one of the most sensitive ministries in the country what should Kenyans expect from you?

I am cognizant of the sensitivity of this ministry; it is a matter of life and death. Matters of health touches on every Kenyan.

I am clear on what I need to deliver and that I should give Kenyans all we promised including Universal Health Coverage (UHC) which is one of my top priorities.

Many are expecting UHC to be an event. It is a process and measures and strategies are being put in place to be able to achieve this agenda.

To start us off the journey we have two key pillars. The Kenya Medical Supplies Authority (Kemsa) will ensure the security of commodities to drive health care while the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) will deal with the financing bit ensuring that money to take care of Kenyans' health is available.

We are doing a lot of reforms in the two institutions to realign our goals.

At the NHIF we are shifting the thinking from just registration and taking care of individuals to households. Instead of covering an individual where a spouse contributes and they are taken care of individually by NHIF they will instead be taken care of as a household.

The national insurer has concentrated on schemes; we have forgotten about the basics. We are now structuring NHIF to be able to cover people at the bottom of the pyramid.

It has not been an easy task pushing Kenyans at the informal set-up to pay up their monthly contribution. We are coming up with an essential package for all Kenyans regardless of their class; this will not dictate the kind of service you get and doing away with the schemes.

We are reorganising finances at NHIF to focus on primary health care — preventive promotive and rehabilitative. What we are saying is that we want a scheme that covers everyone.

There have been so many complaints from Kenyans about NHIF; not getting services and hospitals complaining of reimbursement delays. How best can the issues be handled?

NHIF is not meant to be competing for private insurance which is what is happening now because of the many enhanced schemes. We are refocusing this and concentrating on the hustlers and the poor.

We are introducing a national social security scheme which takes care of everybody and for Kenyans who can afford private insurance to pay for it.

With the introduction of the basic package anyone can get services in all facilities in the country. We are moving away from competing with private insurance and refocusing NHIF to meet the needs of every common Kenyan.

Why then are government employees (police and teachers) shifting their cover from NHIF?

Why would NHIF take care of a police force while a mama mboga is not able to access health care? Is this equity? It is not.

If the police want the enhanced scheme let them have it at a private provider while we create room and finances for a common Kenyan who cannot be able to get the services in a private hospital.

You came in at a time when Kemsa was marred by numerous scandals. What are your plans to clean it up?

A major shift in how we conduct our operations as Kenyans is on the way.

The agency has been on reforms for a very long time and I am not getting into this ship of reforms. We have to move. Kenyans need services.

If Kemsa is unable to do procurement then we will have to give the sector to experts — there are so many of them in this country — to procure then Kemsa can warehouse and distribute.

It has the capacity for warehousing and distribution so we will leverage what it is good at the moment and whatever it is not good at we will see how best we can achieve that.

In Kenya Kwanza plan we promised affordability of commodities and health care and this is purely the responsibility of Kemsa. We are rethinking what strategies to use in terms of procurement to meet the basic needs of Kenyans.

We have developed an essential package to have all the institutions including private public and faith-based working together in terms of procuring the commodities to achieve economies of scale and distribution through Kemsa.

In procurement once you consolidate and the quantities are big you buy less frequently and this will reduce the cost of health care. We are analysing the national requirements of all the commodities and procuring them at once at the lowest price possible.

Health ministers who have come before you have talked of Afya House cartels. What’s your plan to tackle them?

These are people known to us. I know them by their names and faces. Should they make my work difficult I am going to announce them in public so that they stop interfering with my work if that is what it takes.

Why do we make it look like they are people without faces and names? They are companies owned by people we know.

It is going to be difficult for them to penetrate. The inside cartels should just be ready to move to other ministries.

I have made it very clear that any meeting should be done in my office and not in the bars where they meet to strike deals. I know they will hate it but this has to be done.

One of the things that I am very keen on is the process that we are following; we are going to do away with emergencies where one is rushed to sign documents. If we do our things right there will be no room for cartels.

Procurement is going to be very open and everyone including private public and faith-based hospitals is going to participate.

We are going to leverage technology and everyone can log into the portal and see what’s going on. I have given the CEO at Kemsa instructions.

I have come from a space where we did not use a single paper and operated efficiently. That is how I plan to open up Afya House and it is going to be so easy to use technology to deal with the cartels.

Anybody transacting business with Afya House must use an official email. Why would someone use my personal email to transact business?

Government corruption index reports rate the ministry among the most corrupt. Your take?

I don’t know about the rating but I am not scared at all. With the current government we have no room for corruption and President William Ruto has said this on many occasions.

And to add on that there will be no private institutions; some of us when given offices run them like private entities.

I am going to do the policing part and ensure that we change the face of Afya House.

How do you plan to resolve issues around the Medical Equipment Service (MES) scheme?

Leasing medical equipment is the way to go. It is my view that as a government we are in the business of providing service and not owning machines and equipment.

What we have done with the existing contracts we are reviewing them — we asked for three months to review them. We are moving into the maintenance and service phase where we will be paying less.

Still on counties they have complained that the ministry still retains most of the devolved functions.

There is clarity on what the national government is supposed to be doing same for counties but we are going to complement and work together because our focus is patients.

If we start telling them about devolved functions they will not understand all they want is to ensure that they are able to get drugs and services in hospitals.

We have met with the Health committee and we have agreed that we just have to work together. In the next two weeks we are meeting again to unpack and ensure that we drive towards a common goal.

From your analysis what ails the health sector and how do you plan to fix that?

As we were planning to work on our manifesto as Kenya Kwanza we did research to find out the issues in the health sector to come up with plans.

First is that most Kenyans are paying for their health care from their pockets and many WhatsApp groups are being formed to fundraise for medical support.

My plan is to reduce this and how we do this is by working with many entities and sourcing collectively for commodities used in the health sector. This is by focusing on NHIF for health care financing to take care of the health of all Kenyans.

Secondly lack of proper health commodity security. We have a plan of transforming Kemsa to function optimally to fill the gap.

Once we start procuring well through other mechanisms then we will be able to take care of health commodities.

Thirdly the health workforce where a big number of health workers belong to the counties but we have a role to play at the national level.

We want to centrally manage health workers in such a way that counties are sharing experts.

The fourth was the cost of health products and technologies. The solution here is local manufacturing. How do we improve and build the capacity of the manufacturers to produce for local consumption and export the excess?

In Kenya 70 per cent of drugs in the market are imported. We have started a conversation with the National Treasury to ensure that the tax regime is friendly enough for the local manufacturers to manufacture and meet Kenya’s requirements.

Local manufacturing will also earn revenue for the country; if we are able to produce more than we need we can sell the excess.

Moderna is groundbreaking in March to start local manufacturing of vaccines.

The fifth issue identified was corruption and the solution was to use technology; with the help of the ICT ministry we must have a system that every Kenyan can own their health records on their phones.

What keeps you awake at night?

I might answer this question and find myself in trouble but the truth is I did not anticipate the magnitude of the position.

On my appointment it was overwhelming and exciting and the moment I started working I realised it is not what I thought.

I am having to work extremely hard but I want to believe that we are just taking off. So far it is been very busy and my sleep pattern is not consistent.

It is a shift of course and I can no longer do the things I used to take for granted like just walking to Moi Avenue and having my fries.

There is a lot to be done and I no longer have time for my friends. I am very cognizant of the work balance. I really try to give my son his time.

I am awakened by the fact that all Kenyans are focusing on me to give my best. My boss President William Ruto who is a performer wants nothing but the best for Kenyans.

Has this position affected how you relate with your family?

Very much. In my previous job I was working from home; it was paperless so we could work from anywhere.

I was always home with my family but now I have to be in the office. I am not available all the time but once I get the balance I am going to be available to them and they understand.

What do you want to be remembered for?

I want to be known as Mama Afya Mashinani so that anyone walking to any facility in this country can get services. That I brought down this heavy monster that people call UHC to the people.

We have a huge population of youth who are always on their phones. I want them to know that I brought healthcare to their phones and they can access their data and medical records on their phones.

What is your parting shot?"

It is especially convenient at gas pumps where your phone is likely mounted to your dashboard or sitting in a cupholder.

One excellent option for digital payment is PayPal.

Google Pay and Samsung Pay both allow you to link your PayPal account to their digital wallets.

Unfortunately this is not yet true of Apple Pay.

20 Gas Stations That Accept PayPal

1. Chevron

Chevron began as the Pacific Coast Oil Company in 1879 in San Francisco.

They built refineries and drilled for oil for years before the first motor vehicles hit the road.

After a few name changes and expansions Chevron as we know it today was born.

Today there are around 7000 Chevron locations throughout the United States.

Chevron fuel boasts the addition of Techron which the company claims will maximize gas mileage while minimizing emissions.

You can pay using PayPal through Google Pay and Samsung Pay at Chevron.

Once your PayPal account is linked to your digital wallet you can pay with your phone at the pump.

2. Texaco

Texaco was started in 1902 under the name Texas Fuel Company.

For a long time Texaco was the only gas company selling gasoline under the same brand name in all 50 states.

This made it a truly national company.

In 2001 Chevron bought Texaco and took over its refineries.

Many of its stations were then divested to Shell.

However Texaco stations can still be found throughout the country.

There are roughly 1300 locations today.

Because it is owned by Chevron Texaco fuel also has Techron in it.

To pay with PayPal at Texaco download the Texaco app and input your PayPal information.

You can then pay through the app when at the pump.

You can even pay while sitting in your car.

3. Shell

The Shell Company began in London when Marcus Samuel began importing seashells from the Far East to sell in his store.

He passed the company on to his sons who expanded the company and began importing and exporting oil.

The company was later named Shell as a tribute to their father and his business’s humble beginnings.

After 185 years Shell is a global company with over 14000 stations across the United States.

With the Shell app you can use PayPal to purchase fuel as well as items from inside the store.

4. Phillips 66

Phillips 66 opened its first gas station in 1927 in Oklahoma.

The name came from the name of the refinery owners—Frank and L.E. Phillips—and the road test of a new fuel when the test car reached 66 mph on Route 66.

During World War II the company produced aviation fuel for Allied airplanes.

The company merged with Conoco in 2002 to form ConocoPhillips.

After a split in 2012 the company returned to the name Phillips 66 though it is still linked to Conoco.

There are around 7500 Phillips 66 gas stations across 48 states with the company’s headquarters residing in Texas.

Phillips 66 only accepts PayPal through Samsung Pay at participating locations.

5. Exxon Mobil

In 1859 the first successful oil well was drilled in Titusville Pennsylvania.

This led to the formation of the Standard Oil Company which dominated the oil industry for many years by taking over other oil companies.

After a landmark Supreme Court case was decided against Standard Oil in 1911 the company split into 34 different oil companies which evolved into many of the gas stations on this list.

Exxon Mobil emerged from Standard Oil of New Jersey.

Today there are more than 11000 Exxon and Mobil gas stations in the United States.

Exxon Mobil uses Synergy gasoline which they claim protects your engine from damage and gives your car better performance.

The Exxon Mobil Rewards app accepts PayPal through digital wallets like Google Pay and Samsung Pay.

Once you link your PayPal account to your digital wallet you can use it in the Exxon Mobil app.

6. ARCO

Compared to other gasoline companies on this list ARCO is a relatively new one.

Founded in 1966 under the name Atlantic Richfield Company ARCO decided in the early ‘80s to go cash-only.

In 1986 after several rough years they began to accept ATM (debit) cards with a 10-cent transaction fee—something that many stations still charge today.

ARCO was acquired by BP in the year 2000.

It was then sold to Tesoro in 2012.

They’ve recently begun to accept credit cards and digital payments.

Today there are around 1300 ARCO gas stations throughout the western United States and northwestern Mexico.

ARCO accepts PayPal when linked to Google Pay and Samsung Pay.

Simply input your PayPal information and then pay with your digital wallet at the pump.

7. BP

After seven frustrating years of drilling for oil in Persia William D’Arcy’s First Exploitation Company struck paydirt in 1908.

They then became the Anglo-Persian Oil Company housed in England.

Anglo-Persian purchased the assets of British Petroleum (BP) in 1917.

When Britain entered World War II BP supported the war effort by providing aviation fuel and engineering a gasoline pipeline that followed Allied ships to Normandy.

Throughout the 20th and 21st centuries the company saw tragedies such as the Texas City Refinery explosion and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

Despite it all the company still exists today with some 7200 gas stations throughout the country.

BP pumps accept PayPal through Google Pay or you can link PayPal to the BPme app.

8. Sunoco

Sunoco opened its first gas station in Pennsylvania in 1920.

Following World War II they expanded into Canada and Venezuela.

In 1956 Sunoco introduced “custom blending” which allows you to choose from several octane ratings at the same pump.

After exiting the refinery business and filing for bankruptcy Sunoco was purchased and its headquarters were moved to Dallas Texas.

The company has been the official fuel of NASCAR since 2004.

There are more than 5200 Sunoco gas stations in the United States today.

Sunoco accepts Samsung Pay or payment right through the PayPal app at the pump.

At participating locations you can also pay with PayPal for goods inside the store.

9. CITGO

The Cities Services Company eventually CITGO was one of the first companies to provide gas and electricity to public utilities in the United States.

In the 1970s the CITGO Quik Mart pioneered the idea of convenience stores being connected with gas stations.

In Boston the CITGO sign is an iconic sight in Kenmore Square and a major landmark along the course of the Boston Marathon.

There are over 4600 CITGO gas stations across 31 states.

There aren’t any CITGOs in the West or Southwest.

The westernmost CITGO station is in central Texas.

However throughout the East South and Midwest they are easy to find.

CITGO stations accept PayPal on a franchise-by-franchise basis.

Those that do accept PayPal take it through Samsung Pay.

10. Cumberland Farms

Cumberland Farms differs from most other gas stations on this list in that its origins are not in petroleum but in dairy.

In 1939 a couple in Rhode Island purchased a cow and began a small dairy farm.

Cumberland Farms quickly became a series of dairy stores throughout New England which eventually turned into convenience stores.

When cars became more common in the states self-serve gas pumps began appearing outside the stores.

Nearly 600 Cumberland Farms convenience stores are in operation in the United States today.

The pumps at Cumberland Farms accept their SmartPay Rewards app which works with PayPal.

In-store you can use the app or Samsung Pay to pay with PayPal.

11. Speedway

Speedway was founded in 1952 in Michigan.

In 1962 the first incarnation of Speedway became defunct when it was converted to the Marathon brand.

In 1976 however Marathon chose to use the Speedway name once again in self-service stations with convenience stores.

The brand was eventually acquired by 7-Eleven but the Speedway name continues to be used.

There are around 4000 locations in the United States mostly in the East and Midwest though there are some along the West Coast.

Speedway does not accept PayPal at the pump but you can pay with PayPal through Samsung Pay in the convenience stores.

12. Kwik Trip/Kwik Star

Kwik Trip convenience stores first opened in 1965 in Eau Claire Wisconsin.

By 1983 the company had expanded into 50 stores.

Three years after that they had 100 locations.

In addition to traditional convenience store offerings the stores feature bakery and grocery sections.

They also have a small deli that will cook food to order.

Kwik Trip also operates its own dairy which supplies milk cheese and ice cream.

The stores that are located just off highways operate as full-service truck stops.

The Kwik Trip name exists only in Wisconsin and Minnesota while in Iowa and Illinois they are known as Kwik Star stores.

Throughout the four states more than 750 locations are in operation.

Only some locations accept PayPal but those that do will take it both at the pump and in-store through Samsung Pay.

13. Meijer

This chain of gas stations and convenience stores began as the grocery store chain of the same name.

The first Meijer gas station was opened in 1967.

Twenty years later the company opened its first convenience store.

Their gas stations and c-stores operate in the same location as their supercenter stores though not every supercenter has a gas station.

There are 176 Meijer gas stations throughout Illinois Indiana Kentucky Michigan and Ohio.

The stations offer gasoline diesel propane and alternative fuels.

Meijer convenience stores accept PayPal through Samsung Pay.

14. Delta Sonic

Delta Sonic is primarily a car wash though their locations feature gas stations and convenience stores as well.

The car wash chain was founded in 1967.

Their gas pumps offer a variety of fuels and fuel grades.

Customers can get a discount on gas by purchasing a car wash.

The chain operates 29 locations throughout New York Illinois and Pennsylvania.

Unfortunately Delta Sonic does not accept PayPal at the pump but their stores will take PayPal through Samsung Pay.

15. Valero

Valero Energy Corporation was born in 1980 and opened its first full-scale refinery in Corpus Christi four years later.

Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s the company made major purchases and mergers with other oil companies making it the largest refining company in North America.

Later the company acquired several ethanol plants and built 33 wind turbines creating an alternative energy subsidiary.

Today Valero operates 15 refineries throughout the country which supply fuel to more than 7000 gas stations mainly throughout the East and Midwest.

Depending on the franchise owner some Valero locations accept PayPal in-store.

When at a participating location you can pay with PayPal through Samsung Pay at the register.

16. Kwik Fill

Not to be confused with Kwik Trip and Kwik Star Kwik Fill gas stations operate in New York State Pennsylvania and Ohio.

The gas stations are associated with Red Apple Food Mart convenience stores.

Some Kwik Fills are standalone gas stations with no convenience store while others are located with Red Apple stores of varying sizes.

Their nearly 300 locations include four full-size truck stops four mini truck stops and two truck stop motels.

Red Apple Food Marts accept PayPal through Samsung Pay in-store.

17. QuikTrip

The last on a list of similar-sounding names QuikTrip first opened in 1958 in Tulsa Oklahoma.

Initially the company was just a convenience store but they added gas pumps in 1971.

In the 1980s the company opened “travel centers” which featured 5000-square-foot stores 12 gas pumps five diesel pumps and a truck scale.

QuikTrip earned a “Top Tier” rating in 2005 indicating that their gasoline exceeds the EPA’s standards for gasoline additives.

In the ‘90s QuikTrip opened Wendy’s and Burger King fast-food stores in some of their c-stores.

Today QuikTrip operates more than 900 stores in 14 stores.

Their convenience stores accept PayPal through Samsung Pay.

18. Sheetz

Like Cumberland Farms Sheetz convenience stores started as dairies.

In the ‘50s brothers Steve and Bob Sheetz turned their father’s dairy stores into convenience stores.

From 1952 to 1972 the company expanded to 14 locations.

The following year they introduced gas pumps.

By 1983 Sheetz had grown to 100 stores.

As the company grew the stores introduced their own line of coffee and bakery products.

The chain is still family-owned and based in its original city of Altoona Pennsylvania.

There are more than 600 locations across six states on the eastern side of the country.

Sheetz takes PayPal through Samsung Pay at all locations both at the pump and in-store.

19. RaceTrac

RaceTrac began as Carl Bolch Trackside Stations in 1934.

When Carl Bolch purchased Oil Well Company they began expanding through multiple states in the south.

In the ‘70s the company introduced the first self-serve gas stations in Alabama and Georgia.

In 1979 they adopted the name RaceTrac.

They then began Metroplex Energy a subsidiary of RaceTrac that provides bulk fuel to their gas stations.

In 2004 the company introduced fresh food to their convenience stores.

Throughout the early 2010s RaceTrac began expanding its convenience store models adding frozen yogurt machines indoor and outdoor seating and free Wi-Fi.

More than 550 locations operate throughout Florida Georgia Mississippi Louisiana Tennessee and Texas.

PayPal is accepted through Samsung Pay in almost all convenience store locations.

20. 76

In 1932 Union Oil introduced 76 gasoline.

The name was in reference to the US Declaration of Independence being signed in 1776 as well as the octane rating of gasoline at the time.

They are known for their sign which is an orange ball with “76” written on it in blue.

In 2001 the company was purchased by Phillips and became part of the ConocoPhillips company.

The company split in 2012 and now 76 is owned solely by Phillips 66.

There are just over 2000 locations throughout the country mainly in the South and on the West Coast.

The company is a partner with Google Pay so to pay with PayPal you’ll need to link your PayPal account to your digital wallet.

Linking PayPal To Digital Wallets

It’s not currently possible to link PayPal to your digital wallet on iOS devices.

However Samsung Pay and Google Pay have made it possible for Android users.

To be able to pay with PayPal at these gas stations and many other businesses you’ll need to add your PayPal information to the wallet first.

This is a simple process.

1. Google Pay

To add PayPal to Google Pay open the Google Pay app.

Tap the card button at the top of the screen.

Tap “Add a Payment Method.”

Then click “add PayPal.”

Input your information including the email address associated with your PayPal account.

Accept the terms and conditions and you’re all set.

There are two ways to make PayPal your default payment method in Google Pay.

First you can simply long-press the PayPal card and move it to the top of the list of cards.

The other way is to tap the PayPal card and select “Set as default” in the card details screen.

Linking these accounts will allow the two apps to share some data.

The two will share your name billing address email address account type and a few other pieces of information.

2. Samsung Pay

Linking PayPal to Samsung Pay is very similar.

Open the Samsung Pay app and tap “Add PayPal.”

Log into your PayPal account then select a top-up amount.

Top Up is a PayPal feature that allows the app to pull money in increments of $10 from your bank account.

This helps prevent your payment from being declined when you don’t have sufficient funds in your PayPal account at the time of purchase.

The app will also ask you to select a backup funding instrument for your top-up (such as a bank account).

You can add up to five PayPal accounts to your Samsung Pay wallet.

To make PayPal your default payment method through Samsung Pay select the checkbox “add to favorite cards” when linking your account.

Paying With The PayPal App

For those without an Android phone paying through the PayPal app is still an option.

Unfortunately fewer businesses accept the PayPal app than digital wallets but there are a handful that will receive payments in this way.

The PayPal app utilizes QR codes to help you pay for items in-store.

There are two ways to make a purchase at a participating business.

The first way is to use the PayPal app to scan the QR code on the item in question.

However not all businesses have items with QR codes.

The other way to pay is to present your PayPal QR code at the register (found under “show to pay”).

Participating businesses will be able to scan your QR code and the money will come out of your PayPal account.

Los vinos jerezanos cerraron el último año con una caída de ventas del -14% respecto a 2021 y un volumen comercializado de 273 millones de litros el mínimo histórico en las estadísticas que elabora el Consejo Regulador desde 2006.

Las salidas al exterior empañan el auge del mercado español que tocan su techo de la última década con cerca de 123 millones de litros comercializados y un aumento internaual del +124%. El desplome de las exportaciones que ceden un -28% en el mismo periodo con poco más de 15 millones de litros comercializados lastran el buen momento del jerez dentro de las fronteras españolas.

En números redondos las ventas del jerez se reducen el último año en 45 millones de litros por el hundimiento en cerca de seis millones de litros de las salidas al exterior frente a la subida de 13 millones del mercado nacional.

Lo más preocupante es que el grueso del derrumbe de las exportaciones corresponden al Reino Unido el segundo mercado del jerez desde que España lo desbancó como primer destino hace no tantos años donde el sherry se hunde un -417% para bajar ya de los seis millones de litros comercializados (57 millones) frente a los 98 millones alcanzados un año antes.

España supone el 45% de las ventas con 123 millones de litros del total de 273 millones

En la última década las ventas globales del jerez acumulan una caída del 29% que en volumen se corresponde con 15 millones de litros menos bajada que se dispara hasta el 50% tanto en las exportaciones –15 millones de litros menos– como en Reino Unido –seis millones de litros menos–.

Por contra las ventas en España están en máximos de los últimos diez años y a sólo dos millones de litros del récord de cerca de 14 millones de 2006 dentro de lo que podría denominarse la era moderna del jerez cuyo viñedo ha visto reducida su superficie en este tiempo en un tercio precisamente para mitigar el grave problema de excedentes que arrastraba la Denominación de Origen jerezana antes de la sustancial merma de la cosecha de los últimos tres años.

Sequía exportadora

Sequía en la producción y en las exportaciones donde todos los principales destino del jerez ceden terreno salvo Japón que si bien es considerado un mercado estratégico ni siquiera llega a los 150.000 litros eso sí tras una portentosa subida del 100% en el último año.

Europa donde se ubica el grueso de los mercados de grandes volúmenes no escapa al mal momento de las exportaciones de los vinos de Jerez que ceden un -30% en el conjunto del viejo continente hacia donde salieron el año pasado 131 millones de litros –incluidos los 57 millones de Reino Unido–.

Los Países Bajos retroceden un -107% en el conjunto de los últimos doce meses y bajan de los 33 millones de litros mientras que Alemania ronda los 16 millones de litros comercializados en su caso tras una caída del -19.4%.

El jerez pierde un 29% de ventas en la última década y las salidas al exterior bajan a la mitad

El resto de Europa se mueve en torno a los 25 millones de litros y el -225% menos que el volumen de ventas alcanzado en 2021.

Al otro lado del Atlántico también pintan bastos para el jerez que se deja en el último año en América un -133% de sus ventas que retroceden hasta 15 millones de litros. Estados Unidos se mantiene ligeramente por encima del millón de litros comercializados pese al descenso del -166% del último año.

Menos mal que la caída del volumen tendencia que se extiende en el tiempo no se corresponde con la evolución del valor de los vinos de Jerez al alza según se desprende de los informes sectoriales de las instituciones públicas ya que las bodegas siguen sin facilitar este dato al Consejo Regulador.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1vdG9yLmVzL25vdGljaWFzL3JhbmtpbmctdmVudGFzLWNvY2hlcy1lbGVjdHJpY29zLTIwMjMtMjAyMzkyODA0Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ranking de ventas de coches eléctricos 2023,"La movilidad sostenible y más concretamente 100% eléctrica sigue ganando popularidad en el territorio español.

Data analytics has enabled it to quickly and effectively identify fraudulent claims such as fraudulent claim settlements and false medical records. The growth of the insurance fraud detection sector has been aided by the availability of a robust cybersecurity infrastructure that allows the detection of fraudulent insurance claims.

New product and technology launches have strongly affected the growth of the banking financial services and insurance sector. These launches will significantly impact the growth and detection of insurance fraud worldwide. Curacel an insurance company that develops insurance infrastructure in emerging markets has launched an application programming interface-based tool that allows online businesses to add insurance to their products. According to reports the firm has been backed by Y Combinator (YC) a U.S. technology company that builds insurance infrastructure for Africa. Curacel’s API-based interface tool Grow was also integrated with 22 African tech companies. These firms can either bundle their core products with insurance packages or offer insurance as a standalone service to customers. The new tool will also provide new opportunities for service providers of insurance in the travel health and automotive sectors. This strategic move is intended to expand its insurance business in Africa.

The key to leveraging growth in any industry is strategic partnerships. For example the global insurance fraud detection industry is one of them. Kotak General Insurance announced its partnership with Inspektlabs a startup company in computer vision technology. This partnership will utilize Inspektlabs’ artificial intelligence-based technology to automate vehicle inspection and speed up vehicle insurance renewals. According to reports the new artificial intelligence technology (AI) will accelerate vehicle insurance renewals and help detect motor insurance fraud. This strategic move will support Kotak General Insurance’s insurance underwriting processing activities. This initiative will promote the use of AI in detecting insurance fraud in the insurance industry.

Verisk Analytics Inc. (a U.S.-based risk assessment and data analytics firm) and Pacific Life Insurance Company (a U.S. insurance company) have joined forces to continue the trend toward strategic partnerships. This strategic alliance aims to digitize Pacific Life’s life and health insurance products using Verisk’s FAST tool. It improves customer experience by offering seamless life insurance services. Pacific Life will benefit from the initiative to improve its efficiency and decision-making. These market leaders are executing key business strategies such as partnership formations and new product and tech launches to increase their customer base and revenues. These critical business strategies can also be used to detect insurance fraud.",,,,,,,,,

Assistant Professor of Psychological Sciences Steven Berkley PhD understands the uncertainty that follows graduation from college and hopes his example will take some of the pressure off of his students as they decide on their career paths.

“My introduction to academia was not linear” says Dr. Berkley who is part of the Borders and Social Justice cluster at the University of San Diego. “Sharing my story reduces some of their anxiety about their next steps. I try to encourage students that they do have time to figure it out.”

Berkley who came to USD last year as a diversity postdoctoral fellow landed a position out of college teaching math and accounting at a high school in Baltimore Maryland while he was deciding on his career direction. That led to leadership positions at educational nonprofits in New York City and Baltimore. Those experiences convinced him that he could best become a catalyst for change in education by entering academia where he focused on youth development and race and ethnicity in higher education.

He is currently teaching Child and Adolescent Development where students learn about the physical cognitive and social domains of development especially from infancy to early adolescence. The Black Families course covers the history of Black families in the United States from a social-historical perspective and in the context of how Black families’ psychological health and well-being are affected. His roles as an educator and researcher shape his unique outlook on the educational political and socioeconomic environments of marginalized families and individuals.

From that perspective Berkley says he appreciates USD’s efforts to bring attention to the roles of ethnic-racial minority students and the focus on transitioning the university into a Hispanic-serving institution prioritizing interests of other students.

Berkley is one of fourteen new faculty members hired as part of the university’s collaborative new hiring strategy that focuses on bringing new faculty from various thematic areas to join the College of Arts and Sciences community. He sees the cluster concept as a strong incentive for faculty to consider the interdisciplinary possibilities between their fields and where their scholarship overlaps.

“Prior to the beginning of the semester I appreciated meeting all the newer faculty and thinking about all the different amazing things we are doing and all of the cool opportunities to work together and co-create” he says. “The idea of the clusters is important and what the three clusters stand for moves [the university] in the direction of where we are in the world today.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vdHVybnRvMTAuY29tL25ld3MvbG9jYWwvZmFtaWx5LWZyaWVuZHMtZ2F0aGVyLXRvLW1vdXJuLXRlZW4ta2lsbGVkLWluLWJlcmtsZXktY3Jhc2jSAV9odHRwczovL3R1cm50bzEwLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9sb2NhbC9mYW1pbHktZnJpZW5kcy1nYXRoZXItdG8tbW91cm4tdGVlbi1raWxsZWQtaW4tYmVya2xleS1jcmFzaA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Family friends gather to mourn teen killed in Berkley crash,"Family and friends of Dylan Quinn gathered in Swansea Saturday morning to mourn the loss of the 16-year old student athlete.

We may receive a commission on purchases made from links.

Almost every household spends part of its monthly budget on household goods. While this could mean anything that's used to maintain a home we will limit this to cleaning products including hand soap dish soap laundry detergent disinfecting wipes paper towels and all-purpose sprays. If you often buy these items from brands like Clorox Gain or Dawn you may be wondering where to purchase them for the lowest price.

Two of the most common retailers to buy household goods from are Target and Walmart. To see which one has the cheapest prices we will be comparing the exact same cleaning products from both these stores. If you're shopping online you should also take into consideration the cost of shipping. While Target provides free shipping for orders over $35 or for those who use their RedCard Walmart's delivery costs around $7 to $8 unless you're a member of Walmart+ which costs about $13 a month. They both also allow you to pick up in-store or have the items brought out to your vehicle."

In Fall 2022 Jeff Malmberg’s documentary Mickey: The Story of a Mouse released on Disney+. The film had screened at SXSW prior to the wide release telling its story about the journey from concept to the now-iconic character that is Mickey Mouse. The documentary drilled into Walt Disney’s creative process the rumored inspiration for Mickey the way the world responded to Mickey (potentially shifting the concept of merchandizing forever) and charting the evolution of Mickey himself from brazen scamp to loveable leader. With the latest home release from Walt Disney Animation Studios home viewing audiences get a chance to watch that evolution for themselves whenever they like. In part to celebrate 100 years of Disney magic Walt Disney Animation Studios is releasing on home video a 10-film collection of Mickey and Minnie Mouse shorts several being released for the first time called Mickey & Minnie 10 Classic Shorts – Volume 1.

In presentation order the shorts included are:

Steamboat Willie (1928) Brave Little Tailor (1938) The Little Whirlwind (1941) Mickey’s Delayed Date (1947) On Ice (1935) Hawaiian Holiday (1937) Mr. Mouse Takes A Trip (1940) Figaro and Frankie (1947) Bath Day (1946) Thru The Mirror (1936)

Told as though Mickey and Minnie are reminiscing through a photo album the two characters introduce each of 10 shorts weaving together a story of their adventures and affections. It’s a novel approach that adds a bit of fun when viewers opt to watch the films as a single 83-minute feature. Each introductory vignette is modern in color and design offering a stark contrast against the shorts which are restored but not fully modernized. (In one short in fact Mickey’s Delayed Date I worried that something was wrong with my television as there was a line of white pixels at the top left breaking through the black lining on the side of the short. Thankfully it proved to be just part of the presentation.) Told entirely in-character the “brand-new narrative” offers a touch of whimsy going into each short but as they are only told from the perspective of the characters there’s no sense of period from their release or context regarding their history within the company or to animation as a whole.

Be advised that the review copy Walt Disney Animation Studios provided is a digital copy so I can’t speak to how the presentation looks on-disc or if there are any included bonus materials. I used an Apple TV to access and screen the collection which offered the ability to screen as a single-feature or to jump to an individual short. Perhaps it’s my internet but I found that watching as a single feature and then using the chapter selection to jump to a short was faster than using the “Short Selection” subheading on the main menu to watch any of the films. Looking at the film via MoviesAnywhere’s browser there doesn’t appear to be a way to watch the shorts individually and no bonus materials are included there either. For an anniversary package the fact that all it includes are the 10 shorts feels like undercutting the excitement a little bit. In fact while the walk down memory lane is fun if not for watching The Story of a Mouse last Fall I wouldn’t know how interesting (or political) the shift in Mickey over the years has been an aspect which makes watching the shorts within that historical context all the more interesting.

This release is for those who loved the shorts and don’t already have access to them. If that sounds like you you’ll want to jump on this. Unfortunately for those who’d love some context to go with it some sense of the time/place in which they were made some manner of preserving the significance or use of these shorts there may not be enough to warrant snagging this at all. Sure it looks great some of the colorized sequences appearing just a bit touched up or restored but without anything other than the shorts on-disc this only serves to increase access to them without a reason as to why they matter. As a centennial celebration it feels like a missed opportunity.

Available on digital January 31st 2023.

Available on Blu-ray and DVD February 7th 2023.

After several months of negotiations Disney World workers in Orlando Florida overwhelmingly rejected the Walt Disney Co.'s ""best offer"" of a $1 pay raise this year for thousands of workers fighting to survive in a region of the United States that's experiencing a cost-of-living crisis.Over the course of two days more than 14200 Disney World workers in Orlando voted on whether to accept the company's contract proposal — and in an unambiguous rebuff 96% said no.As the results were announced at roughly 7 p.m. Friday a crowded room of well over a hundred cast members wearing union shirts (and some still in their work uniforms) erupted in applause whooping and hollering in celebration of the resounding rejection.""This vote sends a clear message that Disney workers are united in our belief that Disney can do better and Disney must do better"" said Matt Hollis president of the Service Trades Council Union and national vice president for the Transportation Communications Union.According to the STCU a coalition of six labor unions in Central Florida that represent 45000 Disney World workers Disney's offer would have left 30000 Disney World workers behind  with just a $1 pay raise this year. Prior to the vote all six unions had urged union members to reject the contract  arguing that Disney's so-called ""best offer"" wasn't sufficient to keep up with rising inflation higher rent and basic living expenses and that workers had the power and leverage to fight for more.Some union workers such as culinary staff would have seen the immediate $3 pay raise that the unions have been fighting for since August but workers still resoundingly voted down the offer in solidarity with those who wouldn't have received that increase.A spokesperson for the Walt Disney Co. toldin an emailed response to the vote Saturday morning “Our strong offer provides more than 30000 Cast Members a nearly 10% on average raise immediately as well as retroactive increased pay in their paychecks and we are disappointed that those increases are now delayed.”Paul Cox president of IATSE Local 631 which represents stage technicians costuming wardrobe and cosmetology workers at Disney World cast doubt on the validity of that 10% figure however in a tweet. ""$1 for someone making $15 is not 10% it is 6.6% that is some mighty large rounding that @WaltDisneyWorld is doing there. If it is “nearly 10% “ then Disney should have no issue meeting the Union’s proposal"" wrote Cox.According to the company 25% of non-tipped workers represented by the STCU would have reached $20 an hour wages in the first year of the contract. Cast members would also have received retroactive increased pay dating back to October 2022 starting at a minimum of $700 for those working at least 40 hours per week and 8 weeks of paid family leave that the unions had fought for. But that's all not necessarily off the bargaining table now and could still make it into the final contract.The unions' previous contract expired back in October although that has been extended until a new deal can be reached. Based on surveys and discussions with union members the STCU has been fighting for an immediate $3 pay raise for all union members including employees such as park greeters culinary staff character performers stage technicians custodial workers bus drivers for the parks and more.That $3 raise would bring the starting wage to $18 an hour this year up from $15 for most with additional raises to come over the course of the contract. Workers say that's the least Disney can do.Sean Hopper a 36-year-old who works at Star Wars Galaxy’s Edge in Disney's Hollywood Studios and shop steward for his union Unite Here Local 362 toldthis week he knows of cast members who are homeless who sleep in their cars and who cut down on food costs by eating only cheap ramen packs. Many have families they work to care for and have long commutes.Hopper himself arms adorned with Star Wars tattoos is married and a father of three kids. All three have Star Wars-themed names. Hopper's always had a soft spot for Disney and the magical experience it can offer for kids and families. Visiting the parks was a highlight of his childhood and he loves being able to re-create that same kind of experience for others through storytelling.But as many workers have said through the contract negotiations process magic doesn't pay the bills Earl Penson a second-generation Disney employee of 11 years told Orlando Weekly in November ""I’ve seen grown men break down"" because of the financial stress of trying to make ends meet when making just a few dollars above Florida's minimum wage of $11 per hour. (Note: Until September 2021 it was just $8.56 per hour.)Cast members try to find ways to cut costs multiple cast members told skipping meals and sometimes working multiple jobs to cover basic needs like rent in a region that's home to one of the country's most unaffordable housing markets.A report released last year by Unite Here Local 737 one of the unions that represents Disney workers shared that out of 2415 tourism workers surveyed (including Disney workers) 69% said they hadn't had the money to pay rent or mortgage costs over the last year. Twenty-six percent said they had to move as a result of rent or mortgage increases and 45% reported skipping meals to cut costs.A living hourly wage for two working adults with one child in Orange County is $32.51 according to MIT's Living Wage Calculator  or $18.85 for a single working adult with no children.Meanwhile the Disney Parks' division reported $28 billion in revenue last year and an operating profit of $12 billion. Disney has found the money to pay CEO Bob Iger $27 million and to gift former CEO Bob Chapek who was fired in November a $20 million severance package . During the 2020 election cycle the ""woke"" corporation also found the money to give the re-election campaign of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (albeit they're not on good terms at the moment) $50000 in March 2021 and another $50000 two years before that.Diego Henry Jr. a Disney Parks worker of 10 years and shop steward for his union Unite Here Local 362 toldhe was excited about the unions' decision to stand together and reject the contract. He says their fight thousands of union members strong in a state with just 4.5% union membership  is bigger than Disney.""This fight is not just for Disney. It starts here but whatever happens at Disney happens everywhere else"" said Henry. In 2018 Disney World workers successfully fought for a $15 minimum wage by 2021 setting a standard for the Central Florida region's tourism industry ahead of Florida's vote in 2020 to get the entire state on track towards a $15 minimum by 2026.About 250 Disney cast members in Orlando took a three-day leave last week with their union to set up and conduct the vote at over 100 voting locations across the sprawling Disney Parks property. A wall of stacked boxes labeled according to where they were placed on the property created a wall in the Magnolia rooms of the Wyndham Hotel Friday evening where union members counted each voting card manually.Hollis the president of the STCU toldthat Disney had waged its own campaign to persuade workers to approve the company's ""strong offer"" this week pulling individual workers into private meetings showing up to talk to workers before the starts of their shifts and airing ""Vote Yes"" propaganda on TV screens in employee break rooms.While awaiting vote results Friday night Hopper the Star War's Galaxy Edge employee admitted he was exhausted from the week's work. In addition to life at home with the family organizing a vote for up to 32000 eligible employees in two days' time takes a lot of manpower and as a shop steward he's been actively involved with contract negotiations since last summer.And he has to work this weekend. Having conversations with workers fielding their concerns and needs in the workplace is emotionally draining but highly rewarding Hopper said.Henry the attractions employee toldhe's got the day off on Saturday and was glad of it. So does Mel Paradiso an attractions employee at Disney's Magic Kingdom and mother of a four-month-old son who recently returned to work from maternity leave.But she begins her new role working a third-shift custodial job at Animal Kingdom on Sunday — an overnight position she toldwas necessary so she could stay with her kid during the day while her husband (who also works) stays with him at night. Their rent has gone up she said and they can't afford the hundreds of dollars it would cost them to pay for childcare since Disney's employee childcare program is only open during limited hours of the day. New childcare data from the U.S. Department of Labor shows childcare prices are untenable for many working families even as childcare workers themselves often earn less than a living wage With Disney's lackluster contract proposal shot down by union members the next step per the unions is to call on Disney to come back to the bargaining table. ""And when they get there"" said Hollis the STCU president ""we expect to see a real strong offer economically that addresses the current record inflation skyrocketing rent and the cost-of-living increases that workers are facing today.""This vote came just days after food service workers at the Orange County Convention Center won a new contract delivering an $18 minimum wage this year up from $13 and a $3 pay raise for every worker covered by the contract. It also comes the same day multiple media outlets confirmed that Florida lawmakers will hold a special legislative session Monday to discuss a state takeover of Disney World’s Reedy Creek Improvement District among other issues."

Execs With Recent DC Comments,"DC Studios co-CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran have reportedly already caused some upset among certain Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) executives due to their recent comments against the old DC regime.

After the WBD merger placed David Zaslav in charge the newly-placed CEO quickly began the search for his answer to Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige to lead the DC franchise moving forward. After all it was clear things weren't working out under former DC Films President Walter Hamada.

Having gone through plenty of candidates that hunt finally came to a head with the appointment of The Suicide Squad director James Gunn and Shazam producer Peter Safran to serve as co-CEOs of the newly-founded DC Studios and develop a project slate with a sense of cohesion moving forward.

In the three months since their appointment the duo has developed a slate of projects for the new DCU that has since been revealed in a huge marketing push. This campaign has come with plenty of interesting comments from Gunn and Safran some of which seem to be frustrating certain high-ups at WBD.

DC Studios CEOs Allegedly Frustrating Warner Bros.

DC

According to The Hollywood Reporter's (THR) latest newsletter DC Studios CEOs James Gunn and Peter Safran have reportedly managed to ruffle some feathers with certain Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) executives due to their recent comments about the old DC regime.

The newsletter points out that among the slew of comments Gunn and Safran have already made about the previous management of the DC universe some were ""not exactly tactful."" The report stated that some of those from the old regime are still now in charge at WBD and ""there have been quite a few ruffled feathers.""

The DC Studios duo are described by THR as ""moviemakers"" and ""not corporate."" Unlike other executives who ""either toe the company line express generic and genial statements or retweet praise"" Gunn has been doing things his way by swatting down Twitter rumors and even holding fun polls for fans.

Speaking to journalists at the private DCU slate reveal event Gunn criticized DC's past as ""pretty messed up"" and noted how Warner Bros. was ""giving away IP like they were party favors:""

""The history of DC is pretty messed up. No one was minding the mint. They were just giving away IP like they were party favors to any creators who smiled at them. What we are going to do is promise that everything from our first project going forward is going to be unified.""

A second comment - that may or may not refer to DC's past - zoned in on his intent to avoid ""putting hundreds of millions of dollars into a film where a screenplay is only two-thirds of the way done:""

""We’re not going to be making movies and putting hundreds of millions of dollars into a film where a screenplay is only two-thirds of the way done and we have to finish it while we’re making the movie. I’ve seen it happen again and again and it’s a mess. And I think it’s the primary reason in the deterioration of quality of films today versus 20-30 years ago.""

Are Gunn & Safran's DC Jobs at Any Risk?

The search for the DC head honcho was one that lasted for a long time with Zaslav reportedly approaching Arrowverse boss Greg Berlanti The Lego Movie producer Dan Lin and even Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige for the top job. And yet for various reasons WBD never managed to reach a deal with anybody.

So far after a long search for both an effective choice and one that would satisfy that fandom things seem to be working out under Gunn and Safran. The reactions to the slate were largely positive fans seem to be enjoying Gunn's more transparent approach and excitement for DC seems the highest it's been in years.

Although David Zaslav was quick to axe a number of WBD executives on his arrival many still remain some of which will undoubtedly be bitter after the firing of their former colleagues. So it's not surprising that Gunn and Safran's criticism of their years of past work to get DC off the ground would lead to some resentment.

That being said they aren't the only ones who have been critical of the old regime as Zaslav himself said back in November that they have ""an awful lot to do and an awful lot to undo"" at WBD as a whole. With the CEO firmly in agreement with Gunn and Safran they will undoubtedly be safe.

Granted these comments against certain executives would not be at all firable offenses by any means but rather just negative for their future working relationships. But either way after how long it took to find DC Studios' CEOs and develop this masterplan the duo may be WBD's hottest commodity at the moment.

It's hard to disagree with the pair's criticism of the past DC management after all fans have been doing the same for years. Despite housing the biggest household names on the planet the old regime failed to generate box office results positive reception or properly create a cohesive universe after years of efforts.

In general whether it frustrates certain WBD executives or not admitting the mistakes of the past was perhaps the most important step DC Studios needed to take. This will help to rebuild the trust of fans and create a sense of why things will be different this time around after years of disappointment.

This year will also mark the biggest most high profile most star-studded rendition of what has become the “People’s Open.”

The PGA Tour in an effort to stave off the upstart LIV Golf League which has been pilfering some of the top names in the game for the last nine months has ramped up the prize money in a big way. The Phoenix Open had a purse of $9 million in 2022. It’s more than double that in 2023.

The two-man waste collection business was contacted by Middle-earth Enterprises which owns the worldwide rights to The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Nick Lockwood and Dan Walker run the company which collects household building and office waste across East Sussex and West Sussex.

The pair said they have been issued with a cease and desist notice after it was claimed they were in breach of the well-known franchise’s trademarks.

As well as changing the firm’s name and website they have been forced to ditch their company slogan – “One ring to remove it all”.

Lockwood 36 told the Sun: “If we don’t turn up on time no one’s going to chuck their Lord of the Rings DVD in the bin. And if they bring out a box office smash I don’t think more people are going to ring up for waste collection. It’s just bullyboy tactics.”

He added: “We now have the prospect of spending thousands of pounds and [a lot of] effort on rebranding to appease a multibillion-pound company. We will survive this storm and continue providing a great service for our city whatever our name.”

The legal letter reads: “You have made use of names and slogan highly similar to the Lord of the Rings. Your activity amounts to an infringement of our client’s trademark rights.”

Lawyers for the franchise also told the businessmen that it reserved the right to “seek damages” over the “unlawful activity”.

Walker also 36 said: “We can’t afford to fight them. We’re just trying to make people smile and make a living.”

It is not the first example of global firms flexing their legal muscle to force smaller businesses into name changes.

In 2017 a shopkeeper dealt with the threat of legal action from Sainsbury’s over his similarly named store by changing its name from Singhsbury’s to Morrisinghs.

Jel Singh Nagra changed the name of his convenience store in West Allotment North Tyneside after Sainsbury’s said its original name Singhsbury’s was too similar to its own branding.

Machine learning has a “black box” problem meaning that it’s in many cases impossible to know how a machine learning algorithm comes to its conclusions.

An AI application that detects cancer for example may not be able to show an oncologist how it determined the presence of cancer in a patient’s body. As a result if the oncologist used the application to diagnose a patient they wouldn’t be able to explain to the patient what makes them sure they have cancer.

This issue relegates AI applications in life sciences to experiments and pilots and widespread adoption although likely inevitable may not come for a while as public opinion shifts toward accepting that its diagnoses are informed by decision-making artificial intelligence and regulations evolve to match. For now life sciences companies are mostly using AI for research and development drug discovery and sales and marketing.

The AI vendors in this report all claim to help research centers and laboratories and pharmaceutical companies with at least one of the following:

Assisting scientists in handling and measuring liquids with greater accuracy and consistent repeatability as well as helping them find data about antibody usage.

Providing sales and marketing teams with information and recommendations on how to engage with healthcare professionals and organizations.

We start our analysis of AI in life sciences with its research and development applications.

Scientific Research

Andrew Alliance

Andrew Alliance offers the Andrew robot which it claims can help molecular biology immunology cell biology microscopy and other life science research laboratories assist scientists in handling and measuring liquids with greater accuracy and consistent repeatability in their experiments using machine vision.

Andrew Alliance claims that the robot works with the AndrewLab software which helps scientists create pipette protocols or predefined written procedures to follow in experiments through the interface.

The robot may be able to identify liquid chemicals called consumables their source location and their transfer location. The company also claims that Andrew is able to grip a pipette set the volume insert and eject the pipette tips draw from the source containers and dispense the liquid into new containers without human intervention. The company adds that the software can be programmed to repeatedly dispense the liquids precisely during lab experiments.

The company states that the machine learning model behind the software was trained on light-absorbing liquid samples mixed with Ponceau S a dye used in electrophoresis studies that was diluted with analytical grade water. The company also added chemical detergents and other additives to modify the viscosity of liquids.

The samples produced by the pipetting are then measured either by a photometer an instrument that measures the intensity of light or by a reference balance.

These samples would have been labeled as the concentration of chemicals or compounds. These labeled images would then be run through the software’s machine learning algorithm. This would have trained the algorithm to discern the sequences and patterns of 1’s and 0’s that to the human eye form the image of a formula or chemical element as displayed on the application’s interface.

The scientist using the interface could drag and drop the chemical elements and their amounts that are not labeled into AndrewLab and choose the location where the pipette would source and dispense the liquid.

It is also likely that the robot was trained on images and videos of the pipetting action of dispensing liquid samples at various angles and lighting.

The system then provides documentation of the protocol as a pdf file.

Below is a short 2-minute video demonstrating how AndrewLab works. The software allows scientists to specify pipetting actions such as aliquoting concentration normalization. The company explains that scientists can Indicate their desired concentration and the software automatically calculates the required reagent volumes:

Our research yielded no results when we tried to find case studies for the software nor marquee company clients. The company has raised $14 million in funding from Omega Funds Tecan Group Waters Corp. Impeco Rancilio Cube and Sam Eletr Trust.

Giorgio Horak is the CTO at Andrew Alliance. He holds an MS in physical engineering applied physics from Politecnico de Milano. Previously Horak served as a research engineer at SpinX Technologies.

BenchSci

BenchSci offers a namesake software which it claims can help biomedical researchers and scientists in research laboratories and centers find data about antibody usage using machine learning.

BenchSci claims that the machine learning model behind the software was trained on 5.1 million antibody products more than 3 million vendor-supplied figures and 45000 figures from third-party validators. These were cross-referenced with over 9 million scientific publications according to the website. It also claims to have extracted over 2191100 antibody usages and offers 3415146 images.

The company does not make it clear if the application is web-based or requires some integration with an organization’s system. However it is clear that scientists can start using the application by entering a query in the application’s search bar. Researchers can search by protein gene or clone ID. The application then turns up general hyperlinks leading to information about antibodies that have been proven to work.

We were unable to find information on what the system does with the inputted data to yield an output but we can infer that all the information has been labeled to enable the machine learning algorithms to search through the database to find data with similar labels and include these in the search results.

According to the website the application offers 15 types of filters that researchers can use in conducting searches and narrowing down the results to find the correct antibody. One type of filter is figure data usage which enables users to narrow results based on product specifications from the vendor. Another way to filter is to type the first letters of the antibody or the organism or species on which the experiment was performed. Filtering by vendor allows the researcher the option to either include preferred vendors or exclude vendors they want to avoid.

The company claims that the database is updated with information from new publications and about new products monthly. The application is free to researchers in academic and nonprofit institutions. For business users the enterprise will need to purchase a license.

BenchSci claims to have content from both open- and subscription-based closed-access journals. Researchers are required to authenticate their subscription through their institution’s portal such as through their institution’s library website.

Below is a short 2-minute video demonstrating how the BenchSci software works. Users can enter a protein or gene name on the search bar. The user may also search by protein gene or clone ID. The user can then filter the data based on their experimental needs:

BenchSci claims to have helped Oregon State University (OSU) researchers investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms of skeletal muscle maintenance and how skeletal muscle regulates the body’s metabolism.

Myopathy is a muscular disease where the fibers become weak and do not function properly. Genetic therapies are one way to cure myopathy.

Vera Lattier a researcher and PhD candidate at the university at the time the study was written who works to discover the genetic markers in mice for myopathy therapy reported that some challenges in the research included the volume and inconsistent quality of antibodies the labor-intensive and time-consuming search through numerous publications and incomplete information cited in papers.

Upon using BenchSci Lattier reports that it took about 10 minutes to find the antibody that was being used in a current experiment whereas it previously took a day. Lattier also reported that viewing published figures that were filtered according to the context of the research was helpful in saving time.

The researcher also explained that using the wrong antibody would have cost losing samples which are difficult to collect and could result in a failed experiment. Having found the correct antibody through BenchSci enabled the researcher to save samples from not repeating a failed experiment.

BenchSci also lists the University of Guelph University of Calgary and the University of Toronto as some of its clients.

David Qixiang Chen is Co-founder & CTO at BenchSci. He holds a PhD in neuroscience from the University of Toronto. As CTO he works with high-dimensional data applying information about the brain into deep learning algorithms for automation and prediction in commercial software. Previously Chen served as a neurosurgical research assistant at the University Health Network of the Toronto Western Hospital and a researcher/developer at the same university’s Department of Psychology.

Grail

Grail offers software that can detect cancer early which it claims could help academic medical centers conduct studies that could detect signs of cancer in the bloodstream which in turn could increase cancer survival rates and reduce cancer mortality and suffering using machine learning.

The company states the machine learning model behind the software was trained on clinical and sequencing data of people with cancer such as cell-free nucleic acids that are released into the blood by tumors. The data would then be run through the software’s machine learning algorithm. This would have trained the algorithm to discern which data points correlate to cancer signals.

The software would then be able to predict the presence of cancer cells in the early stages. This may or may not require the user to upload information about the physical symptoms of cancer into the software beforehand.

We could not find a demonstration video available for the software.

Having been established in 2016 Grail is only beginning to organize clinical studies. One of its studies the Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas (CCGA) Study aims to discover genomic cancer signals in the blood of people with cancer and compare it with cancer-free study participants. At the time of this writing in December 2018 the website reports that the study aims to enlist at least 15000 participants in 142 sites in the United States and Canada. About 70% of these had been recently diagnosed with cancer but not yet treated while the rest are known to be cancer-free.

The study is set to collect data from the participants over a minimum of 5 years. Among the partners in this study are Dana Farber Cancer Institute; the Mayo Clinic in Arizona Florida and Minnesota; Memorial Sloan Kettering; and US Oncology Network among others.

Grail does not list marquee clients but has raised $1.6 billion in funding from Sequoia Capital China Hillhouse Capital Group China Merchants Securities WuXi NextCode Blue Pool Capital 6 Dimensions Capital Huangpu River Capital ICBC International and ARCH Venture Partners.

Alex Aravanis is the Chief Scientific Officer and Head of R&D at Grail. He holds a PhD in [electrical engineering and bioengineering from Stanford University and an MD from the same university. Previously Aravanis served as VP of Engineering at Pria Diagnostics VP of Development at Sapphire and Senior Director for R&D at Illumina.

Sales and Marketing of Pharmaceuticals

Aktana

Aktana offers the Decision Support Engine which it claims can help pharmaceutical companies provide their sales and marketing representatives with relevant information and suggested actions on how to engage with target healthcare professionals (HPC) and healthcare organizations (HCO) using machine learning.

Aktana claims that the machine learning model behind the software was trained on customer relationship management (CRM) data. The company explains that the system integrates with Salesforce IQVIA CRM Veeva and Marketo to help marketing teams create multichannel campaigns to support the work of sales representatives.

It’s unclear how the user interacts with the software or what input is required from the user to activate the machine learning but the company reports that the system is capable of segmenting customers. From here we can infer that the algorithms have the capability to create segmented physician groups with similar attributes. This guides the marketing team to personalize the messaging and communication channel.

Examples of segmented physician groups could be those who prefer communicating via email or over phone calls those who hold clinics in one location those with the same specializations and those who might want to consider new treatments for patients.

The system then gives sales representatives at the client company recommendations on how and when to communicate with their targets based on preferred channel geographic proximity availability and call history.

We could not find a demonstration video available for the software.

Aktana claims to have helped an unnamed pharmaceutical company’s sales representatives better prepare before offering products to physicians.

According to the case study Aktana gave the pharma company’s 200 sales reps more relevant information about its customer segments and suggested talking points. Aktana alerted reps when HCPs responded to their communication and helped them identify HCPs who could with important competitive trends.

As a result of using the application the case study reports that more sales reps were satisfied with the CRM and BI tools increased from 58% to 81%. The reps also found it easier to prioritize the HCPs to visit from 52% to 80%. The case study also reports that 60% of sales reps’ visits to target HCPs were reduced by 3-5 days.

Aktana lists Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Pfizer and MSD as some of their past clients. The company has raised $49.2 million in funding from Leerink Transformation Partners Safeguard Scientifics and Starfish Ventures.

Marc Cohen is the Chief Science Officer at Aktana. He holds a PhD in Operations Research from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Previously Cohen served as Chief Science Officer at Archimedes VP of Research at Fair Isaac Corp. and Senior Director at SAS Institute.

But that is minimal compensation for the share price under-performance over the last year. The cold reality is that the stock has dropped 16% in one year under-performing the market.

Although the past week has been more reassuring for shareholders they're still in the red over the last year so let's see if the underlying business has been responsible for the decline.

Check out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo

While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).

Unfortunately Wells Fargo reported an EPS drop of 36% for the last year. The share price fall of 16% isn't as bad as the reduction in earnings per share. So the market may not be too worried about the EPS figure at the moment -- or it may have expected earnings to drop faster.

The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).

Before buying or selling a stock we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends available here.

What About Dividends?

As well as measuring the share price return investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings along with any dividends based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Wells Fargo it has a TSR of -13% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.

A Different Perspective

While the broader market lost about 8.1% in the twelve months Wells Fargo shareholders did even worse losing 13% (even including dividends). Having said that it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably last year's performance caps off a bad run with the shareholders facing a total loss of 0.4% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price there are other factors that are even more important.

Wright Mills published The Power Elite a blistering critique of concentrated political economic and military power in the United States. The book influenced many protest movements of the 1960s and has inspired radical scholars and activists ever since.

Now in 2023 Heather Gautney is continuing Mills’s project of analyzing and mapping out elite power in the U.S. In her new book The New Power Elite she offers a wide-ranging and urgent analysis of entrenched corporate power in the U.S. today. From Wall Street to Big Tech from billionaires to celebrities Gautney maps out the composition of today’s power elite and its methods of exploiting poor and working people to extract evermore wealth and profit.

The New Power Elite is a must-read for anyone interested in understanding and challenging elite power today and creating a more just and democratic society that prioritizes human needs over corporate profits.

Gautney is a professor of sociology at Fordham University. She has published numerous books and articles on U.S. politics and social movements including Protest and Organization in the Alternative Globalization Era: NGOs Social Movements and Political Parties and Crashing the Party: From the Bernie Sanders Campaign to a Progressive Movement. She served as a senior policy adviser to Sen. Bernie Sanders on his 2020 presidential campaign and in the U.S. Senate Budget Committee and she co-chaired the Biden-Sanders Taskforce on Education in 2020.

In this exclusive interview with Truthout Gautney discusses how both Democrats and Republicans allied with corporate elites to create today’s neoliberal order and its concerted project of elite class rule the dangers of ignoring the working class and how we might organize toward a more egalitarian order.

Derek Seidman: The Power Elite by C. Wright Mills was published in 1956. You write that your book is “a continuation of Mills’ program” to understand the nature of elite power. Why did you feel that it was important in our current moment to write this book?

Heather Gautney: First I was a graduate assistant of Stanley Aronowitz who was a Mills scholar. I had read The Power Elite and other works by Mills and I was always excited about him and interested in crafting language and critiques that would appeal beyond the ivory tower of academia. Stanley was that kind of public intellectual and he brought me up in that lineage.

The other thing was that for most of my “academic career” I was an activist in the global justice movement against free trade agreements and other aspects of neoliberal capitalism. I wrote my first book on that. I got to this point where I knew what I was against but I didn’t have a firm understanding of exactly who the people were that I was protesting. So that was a motivation to write this book — a desire to see the other side of it.

That also brought me to apply for a fellowship in Congress to try to situate myself in government where people are making these kinds of consequential decisions. I applied for a fellowship and I ended up working for Bernie Sanders. You really get a sense of the power structures when you work for him because he is contesting them like no one else is. That gave me a particular vantage point — to sort of be on the inside but not be of the inside.

In terms of why I wrote this book now Mills beckoned his readers to perform the same kind of analysis he performed in The Power Elite for their moment. The idea was that I and others would do this for our time. That’s a lineage that Mills left.

In your book you talk about the “concerted class program” of corporate elites and how it has shaped the rise of today’s political and economic order. Can you say a little bit about what you mean by this?

I wanted to emphasize this because a feature of neoliberalism is that it poses as ahistorical. It hides its tracks. It presents capitalism as the best possible system while degrading other systems. So for me it’s really important to show that the political and social inequalities that we have today are by design. They didn’t happen by accident.

For example there’s a lot of commentary about how the Koch brothers played the long game and how smart the right wing has been. But it leaves out the role of the Democrats in the neoliberal class project. The reality is that the Democratic Party at a particular time — really in the lead up to Bill Clinton — made a decision that they were going to sever ties with workers and build ties with corporations. They even had the Koch brothers on the Democratic Leadership Council’s executive council. That’s how flagrant it was.

That was a political decision to try to out-GOP the GOP but it was also a class decision to side with corporate interests and against workers’ interests. Clinton came out of the gate with the North American Free Trade Agreement. He pushed for welfare reform. He deregulated the financial industries and telecommunications — all of these things that we’re paying the price for now but which have been hugely profitable for Big Tech and Wall Street. This wasn’t an accident. And the class perspective — the idea that this was a concerted elite class project — has really been pushed aside.

We also tend to look at the billionaire class and make a distinction between say George Soros and the Koch brothers. But what I try to show in the book is that corporate elites and those who serve them do share common interests on many fundamental things.

In Jeffrey Winters’s book Oligarchy he talks about “wealth defense” — this confluence of interests among the very rich on particular policy issues like taxation or maintaining a low minimum wage. Bill Gates is supposed to be some wonderful progressive philanthropist but talk to him about trade unions or investment in the public sector and he starts to sound a heck of a lot like Charles Koch.

And it’s not just that the rich are rich. Another goal of my book was to emphasize the social relationships undergirding elite power — the ideas methodologies and technologies they’ve imposed on people to get rich and how destructive and horrific they are. There’s a fundamental class program at work in the making of the gross inequality we have today — and at its core is the social relationship of exploitation.

The rise of neoliberalism is a core theme of your book. You emphasize how the neoliberal order has atomized people and weakened social solidarity.

Neoliberals say that they are promoting a system that safeguards individual liberty. But in reality it’s a system that promotes the primacy of profit-making against the collective or public good. That’s why neoliberals call any public spending “collectivist” in a pejorative way.

We see this play out in the school system. In their view public schools are an impingement on human freedom because they require parents to pay into a system that they say forces them to enroll their children in supposedly subpar schools. Never mind that public schools perform the same or better than many private schools. So they promote “liberalizing” education so that parents have a “choice.” But what they really want to do is privatize education and turn it into a profitable industry. The whole charter school movement was about this. Everybody goes to school right? It’s a gigantic field for profiteering.

Also they seek to undermine public education because they know that public schools are spaces where people learn things like civic engagement tolerance and critique. They know that people can be empowered in these spaces.

Within this construct of “protecting individual liberty” the federal government — when acting as an agent of public spending and human and environment protection — becomes the bad guy because it’s imposing a supposedly collectivist way of life on people. It’s a view of freedom as deriving from individual sovereignty and competition as opposed to the idea of a common good — the idea that we can have an institutional system that we all share in and build together that’s not commodified or produced through relations of exploitation.

And obviously there’s a direct relationship between the corruption of the public school system and many Americans’ lack of ability to discern between truthful reporting and conspiracy theories and disinformation. If you have an uneducated public and an atomized population you have the ability to manipulate on a mass scale. I believe that was by design. Today a small number of people wield more control over the means of communication than any dictator has in history. Think about that.

The ultra-right lurch and pro-corporate agenda of Republicans is no secret to most but you really emphasize the central role the Democratic Party has played in consolidating and promoting the neoliberal corporate order. Can you explain more?

I try to show that the Republican and Democratic parties basically operate as a political establishment based on a general consensus around the neoliberal economic order — divesting from public institutions and privatizing them giving corporations the freest hand possible disabling working-class institutions like unions and so on. I try to demonstrate that Democrats have participated in creating and sustaining this order as much as the Republicans have.

Republicans obviously swing much further to the right and are not afraid to be autocratic. Democrats are more technocratic. It wasn’t that long ago that Joe Biden was on the Senate floor talking about how we have to reduce Social Security and Medicare because we can’t increase the deficit. Barack Obama tried to cut Social Security by manipulating Consumer Price Index calculations. He and other Democrats have used the federal budget and fiscal austerity as an excuse to disable social programs that working people rely on.

If you don’t have a political force that’s going to get in the way of the Republican Party then the political horizon is going to shift to the right. And that’s exactly what happened. When the Democrats decided to be the party of Walmart and Wall Street you didn’t have any progressive wing to anchor the kind of New Deal paradigm that had been shaping U.S. politics and the political economic structure.

That’s where I think Bernie was incredibly impactful. He came along in 2016 and demonstrated that a lot of people were open to the word “socialism.” He resurrected that New Deal wing. And I think he exposed the Democrats more than anyone.

This was the benefit of working in the Senate with him and working on his campaigns. You see this stuff up really close. You’re painfully aware of the fact that if you have a progressive viewpoint that because of the money and corporate interests in politics you are up against a Goliath.

I had an interesting experience during my first year working for Bernie in 2013. The Farm Bill was up and Bernie had submitted a handful of amendments. One of them was genetically modified organisms (GMO) labeling. Everybody — at least in Vermont — wants to know if there are genetically modified organisms in their food. Not one Democrat voted for it. No one. I went back and I looked at the campaign contributions for members of the Senate. All of them were getting money from Monsanto. So of course they weren’t going to vote for GMO labeling because that would have screwed over the company that was giving them a couple thousand dollars for their next campaign. It was so flagrant.

That was like a kind of a “come-to-Jesus” moment for me. It was like “Oh this is how it works. They don’t even want us to know what’s in our food.” The Democrats would rather side with this horrible corporation than with everyday people. We saw this with a host of other stuff — Democrats trying to block Bernie from lowering the cost of prescription drugs because they were all getting money from Big Pharma. It was and is an utter disgrace.

You have a whole chapter on Wall Street. What are some ways that Wall Street preserves elite class rule today and dominates poor and working people?

One criticism of Mills was that he didn’t adequately account for the rise of finance capital. That was in the 1950s. Now we can’t ignore it — it’s the fundamental matrix of the global economy.

I attacked the problem of Wall Street from a couple of different perspectives. The first was coming from the analysis in Randy Martin’s book The Financialization of Everyday Life. I looked at the ways in which debt is used as a mechanism of social control and extraction of value from everyday people — student debt credit card debt housing debt predatory lending with payday loans and car loans. It’s banks targeting poor people trying to extract wealth from people who don’t have anything.

Another piece of it was how Wall Street was able to game the housing market making risky bets and essentially treating the global economy like a casino. Time and time again Wall Street has been able to “externalize risk” onto everyday people abetted by politicians on their payroll who are all too happy to issue huge bank bailouts then impose budget cuts to make up for losses.

Then you have private equity firms buying up whole sectors like the rental housing market. They started doing it in the shadow of the housing market crash because people lost their homes and they were able to buy up cheap homes. Now they have these huge rental companies where they make incredible amounts of money renting to people price-gouging them.

They’ve done the same in health care. I wrote about this in the book because I was extremely alarmed by it — that private equity firms are buying up hospitals and “re-engineering” them. They’re closing hospitals even in rural areas which is frightening because rural communities rely on these hospitals. If your hospital closes down you might be two hours away from another one. If you have a heart attack and a private equity firm closes your local hospital because it’s not “profitable” you’re just going to die. They don’t care. It’s not about serving the health care needs of the country. It’s about what’s best for these private equity firms and their profit margins.

We should be turning on MSNBC and seeing reports on this every day because it’s absolutely consequential. But instead it’s Donald Trump and more Donald Trump.

You argue that celebrities are part of the new power elite in a way they weren’t when Mills wrote his book. Can you talk about this in the context of Trump?

In my book I talk about the role of entertainment in politics. If you look at some of the darkest periods in human history and the rise of dictatorships they were all very charismatic leaders. They used entertainment and music and all of these trappings of amusement to bring people in.

Trump really had that skill. He had a dimension of humor. He was very skillful at presenting himself as the “everyman” as well as the ideal man. To his followers he was the billionaire with a big airplane and beautiful wife the “American Dream” personified — but also one of you. These are the features that Theodor Adorno identified in his analysis of German fascism. I’m not equating the U.S. with that historical moment but the tactics were all there and remain there.

Much of this is possible not just because of political disaffection but because of the primacy of entertainment in our culture. Celebrities now have corporate cultural and political power. They have that power because publicity branding and advertising have become major means of public engagement in our society today all enabled by communications technologies and social media.

Trump is made possible by this confluence of political factors but also cultural factors. I’m not the only person to point out that “The Apprentice” was very popular. He’s painted as this big executive in the show and it rated very highly early on. Everyone got to know Trump. And it brought him a certain kind of publicity that translated into political power. We’re seeing more of that now. Look at Dr. Mehmet Oz and Herschel Walker. They didn’t ultimately win but they won their primaries. And the general elections were close especially in Georgia. The fact that Walker came that close to winning says something about celebrity in politics. That’s how we live with celebrity now. We don’t have that relationship with politicians and we don’t trust politicians in this country but we love and adore celebrities.

We don’t have a Democratic Party that is interested in representing the interests of working-class people. That’s how I think Trump is possible. And that’s how Ron DeSantis becomes possible.

Are there any cracks or fissures that you see in the class rule of the new power elite? And what should organizers do today to mount a stronger challenge to the current order?

I outlined a few areas at the end of the book that I think are fertile for progressive efforts to diffuse elite power and work toward a more egalitarian order. One of them is the media. Quite frankly I’m disgusted by the corporate media. I think it’s really important that we support and engage in all kinds of independent media. Truthout is an example — Truthout is great. Adolph Reed has this incredible online project called Nonsite. Without these outlets we’d be missing something really important. We have these centers of information and commentary and we need more of them.

We also have to center the concept of public goods in our political life. That’s been the primary frontier of the political establishment’s attack on working-class and poor people. I think that’s a really concrete policy-driven space that people from all kinds of political backgrounds can focus on. Even people who are manipulated by the right believe in the importance of Social Security and Medicare. I think Bernie was really good at this.

Finally I think as a movement we need to get out of our silos. There’s this fragmentation of movements. I really wanted my book to say to people: Elite power is so concentrated and so deep and so ruthless and violent that there’s no way that one movement over here or over there is going to be able to take on all of these forces. This kind of siloing has to stop. I really believe that people need to get out of their comfort zones and do what Jane McAlevey called “organizing” as opposed to just mobilizing. Labor unions are really good at this. They’re willing to go beyond the converted. We need more institutions like that.

Until we have a real understanding as movements of the fundamental relation of capitalism undergirding all of our struggles then I don’t think anything’s going to happen. In fact it will just get worse.

It approached the court in 2020 citing a news article that Cadila Healthcare Ltd and West Coast Pharmaceutical Works Ltd had got a tentative licence to export the drug and received permission from the United States Food & Drug Administration (USFDA) for the same.The German company claimed it holds the patents for linagliptin which were registered in February 2002 and August 2003 respectively. The patents' registration was valid for 20 years. Hence the suit was filed for declaration that any production and marketing of linagliptin in any form or formulation would be considered an infringement on the company's patent rights.During the city civil court hearing it was submitted that one of the patents had already expired. ""However the defendant Indian companies could not show any material that they hold the authorization to manufacture the drug"" the court noted in its order.It further said that since Boehringer Ingelheim has a patent for Linagliptin and the defendant companies could not show any entitlement to use the patent ""the plaintiff (Boehringer) has prima facie case in its favour and the balance of convenience also lies in favour of the plaintiff.

One of the most important is your solid-state drive (SSD) which holds your operating system and your application data in most cases. SSDs have exploded in popularity over the years and likewise have long left even the best hard drives (HDDs) in the dust with respect to performance (and consumer market penetration).

But if you want to ensure that your SSD is operating in peak condition it’s advisable to perform a health check occasionally. Unfortunately Samsung 980 Pro owners know about this all too well . So here are some of the signs that your SSD might be failing which could eventually lead to a catastrophic event.

Your PC runs slower than usual overall

Applications launch slowly or crash

Blue Screen of Death errors frequently occur

Your SSD flags itself as read-only

Luckily there are a few ways to monitor your SSD’s health using SMART (Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology) built into storage devices and software utilities that interface with it.

Using the Windows 11 Command Prompt to Monitor SSD Health

While you can certainly download and install apps like CrystalDiskInfo and AIDA64 Windows 11 also has built-in analysis tools.

1. Click the Search button from the Taskbar

2. Type in ""CMD"" and hit enter

3. Type ""WMIC"" and hit enter

4. Type ""diskdrive get status"" and hit enter

You will now be presented with one of two results in the command prompt. If you see ""OK"" your SSD is operating nominally. If you see ""Pred Fail"" it's likely that your SSD is malfunctioning and it would be wise to back up your data as soon as possible.

Check SMART Using CrystalDiskInfo

CrystalDiskInfo is a helpful utility that taps into SMART on your SSD and reports those values back in an easy-to-use interface.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

1. Download and install CrystalDiskInfo from the app publisher’s website.

2. Open CrystalDiskInfo which immediately presents you with all pertinent information relating to your SSD(s) and HDD(s)

In this case you can see that the SSD in this system has a “Power On Hours” value of 18857 hours and has accumulated 7654GB worth of writes during its lifetime. You’ll also find details like current SSD temperature and overall health. The installed SSD has 95 percent life remaining (Good) which refers to its wear leveling count.

Check SMART Using AIDA64 Extreme

1. Download and install AIDA64 Extreme (30-day trial) from the publisher’s website.

2. Open AIDA64 Extreme and click on the Storage icon from the main menu.

3. Click on SMART.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

Like CrystalDiskMark AIDA64 Extreme reports the SMART data but in a slightly different way. AIDA64 indicates that the drive has 100 percent of its estimated useful life and reports life writes in terabytes. It also lists the total “Power-On Time” at 785 days. Also noted are the same SMART attribute values (threshold current and worst).

Several SSD makers provide their own free drive health utilities that provide more than just the stats.

Seagate’s SeaTools provides similar SMART reading capabilities as AIDA64 Extreme and CrystalDiskInfo (including attribute tracking and power-on hours) but it also allows you to run several non-destructive diagnostic tests. It also works on non-Seagate drives.

(Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The Short Self Test completes within a few minutes and simply reports if the test Passed or Failed. The Short Generic Test also gives a Pass/Fail grade and takes about a minute to run.

SeaTools can even attempt to fix errors (should they appear in the preceding tests) using the Fix All Short and Fix All Long commands. Fix All can repair and replace bad blocks so the app warns you to back up your data before proceeding.

Samsung Magician Software is another popular utility with SMART diagnostic capabilities and the ability to monitor SSD health. As it's Samsung-specific the software can also let you know if the SSD in your system is genuine. Samsung also loads up the software with a performance benchmark support for over provisioning to boost performance/longevity and the ability to perform firmware updates for your SSD.

Yet another option is the Western Digital Dashboard  which is similar in concept to the Samsung Magician Software as it allows you to check drive health/SMART status keep an eye on temperatures and even upgrade to newer firmware all from one utility.

The Public Company Audit Oversight Board (PCAOB) an independent US agency that oversees the audits of public companies is not satisfied with the work of the Big Four accounting firms as well as smaller firms. The board highlights “a collective increase in the number of audits with deficiencies” in its December 2022 report.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 permits PCAOB’s chair Erica Williams who was appointed in 2022 to assess the control over public companies’ compliance with specific rules and laws.

In 2021 PCAOB teams inspected the work of 141 audit firms and 690 audit reviews. The board concluded that 33% of examinations had at least one deficiency which was worse than 2020’s 29%. First inspectors noticed that auditors potentially did not analyze critical audit matters (CAMs) adequately. Next examiners noted firms’ noncompliance with standards and the failure to test company controls. Finally they spotted recurring deficiencies that should have been addressed.

“The audit profession needs to sharpen its focus on improving audit quality and protecting investors” said Williams.

Williams and the three new board members have been approaching their mission with vigilance. They inspect and if necessary pounce on the worst deficiencies. Last year the board initiated 42 enforcement actions double the number set in motion the prior year. PCAOB imposed the highest-ever penalties in its history in 2022 totaling $11 million.

In another first the agency entered the cryptocurrency fray accusing one company of failing to put in place a quality-control policy to audit the cryptocurrency investments of its client.

The renewed activity of the board is not limited to American public companies; international enforcement cases also increased last year. In 2022 the former head of KPMG’s audit business received a fine for failing to supervise senior colleagues who didn’t cooperate with an inspection and were accused of cheating on training exams. KPMG paid over $7 million for its failures in England Colombia and India. In addition audit firms have tighter requirements to verify outside information about their clients.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vc2Fuam9zZXNwb3RsaWdodC5jb20vdGhlLTE1LW1vc3QtaW5mbHVlbnRpYWwtYmxhY2stbGVhZGVycy1pbi1zaWxpY29uLXZhbGxleS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,15 of the most influential Black leaders in Silicon Valley - San José Spotlight,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vc2Fuam9zZXNwb3RsaWdodC5jb20vdGhlLTE1LW1vc3QtaW5mbHVlbnRpYWwtYmxhY2stbGVhZGVycy1pbi1zaWxpY29uLXZhbGxleS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025625CA88E0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Prestigious entrepreneur and owner of Wikid Films & BoxediN Carlos Williams has diligently worked on his abilities network and platform to ensure his success. He has remained true to his roots and the independent artists of Tennessee showing them the ropes and assisting them in the enhancement of their talents. What was once an idea eventually transitioned into the implementation of strategy which has landed Carlos and his team a variety of opportunities.

Carlos is a prime illustration of the significance of self-investment. He explained “I started out as an engineer for Money Bag Yo about 8 years ago and he needed some videos. So I used my tax money to purchase a camera and started shooting videos for other people.” With only one camera Carlos changed his life.

Since his entrance into the field of videography Carlos’ company Wikid Films has accrued millions of views on YouTube. He has worked with established figures within the entertainment business such as Yung Miami Quavo Jucee Froot Pooh Sheisty Big 30 Big Walk Dog Sett Asian Doll Blocboy JB Kevo Muney Big Boogie (Mental healing or 50 Million Views) and many others. Although working with superstars is a phenomenal experience Carlos continuously shows love to the independent artists who require direction. Carlos expressed “Pretty much every artist in the tri states of Tennesee comes through me. We actually put more of our focus into independent upcoming artists.”

With over 800k subscribers Carlos has developed a beaming platform and is now ready for an additional venture. “I want to start doing short films and a biopic of myself. I have a story I want to get out there but my work isn’t done yet. I want to start doing short films because we have so many ideas and it would be cool to see your ideas come to fruition through film” he stated.

When asked what his biggest obstacle as been thus far Carlos explained “Doing everything by myself with no help up until the last 2 years. Having to rebrand my live performances from “One Take” to “BoxediN” because i was the first cameraman to make live performances with the mic popular. Everyone else started doing it which is fine because there’s enough business for everybody. But then everyone started calling their service MY brand name so we had to rebrand. The new brand is doing very well.”

All three grew up as Eagles fans going to games in Philadelphia and rooting for the likes of Bill Bergey Ron Jaworski Harold Carmichael and Wilbert Montgomery.

All three also spent the majority of their professional football careers playing for the Chiefs.

“The way I see it I can’t lose” Maas said when reached by phone last week.

Maas an All-Delco at Marple Newtown in 1979 spent nine of his 10 pro seasons with the Chiefs after an All-American career at Pitt. He’s the highest drafted Delco football player in history (No. 5 by Kansas City in 1984) and was the 1984 Associated Press Defensive Rookie of the Year a two-time Pro Bowl selection and two-time first-team All-Pro. He’s tied for ninth in Chiefs history with 40 career sacks.

Valerio an All-Delco lineman out of Ridley played five of his six pro seasons with the Chiefs after being selected in the second round in 1991 from Penn. He is tied with Hall of Famer Anthony Munoz and Donald Penn for the most touchdown receptions by an offensive lineman in NFL history with four.

Blundin a two-time All-Delco quarterback at Ridley was drafted by the Chiefs in the second round in 1992 out of Virginia and spent three years with Kansas City before finishing his career in Detroit.

It makes for mixed emotions this weekend in Super Bowl 57.

“You’re just loyal to the Eagles after all these years” said Blundin who was a basketball and football standout at Virginia. “You’re just pulling for them. That’s where you’re from. On the other side I’m just grateful to the Hunt family for giving me that chance to go after a dream there. That was a great start in life for us.

“So gratitude and loyalty I’ll take either one. It’s a win-win.”

“I have to go with the Eagles” Valerio said. “That’s my hometown team. I live here. I’m a Philadelphian and I think any Kansas City fan that listens to our podcast or follows the Chiefs and can remember back when I was there has to understand. As a Kansas City fan you root for the team where you live and the team you grew up following. So just because I played for the Chiefs doesn’t mean I’m going to lose my Philadelphia allegiance.”

Maas and Valerio still have close ties to the Chiefs. Maas lives in Lee’s Summit Missouri 20 miles southeast of Kansas City where he works in commercial real estate. He is a member of the Kansas City Chiefs Ambassadors a group of nearly 50 former players who work directly with the team’s community outreach department for charitable events.

“We do hospital visits school visits goodwill around the community” said Maas a member of the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame. “It’s pretty cool that so many people that played for the team stayed in the area.”

Valerio lives in Glen Mills where he works in mergers and acquisitions for Willis Towers Watson a global insurance company. He co-hosts a weekly podcast called Bleav in Chiefs with reporter Jeff Fedotin.

“When the 49ers played the Chiefs in the Super Bowl (LiV in 2020) we asked Joe Montana who played for both teams who he was rooting for” Valerio said. “He said ‘I’m rooting for the team in red.’”

Maas and Valerio very nearly became Eagles. The Eagles held the fourth pick in the 1984 draft when Maas was coming out of Pittsburgh. They expressed interest in Maas as did the San Diego Chargers who picked sixth.

“Philadelphia told me they were going to take me and San Diego told me they were going to take me” Maas said. “I never heard from Kansas City. I thought I was going to be playing for my hometown team or be out on a beach in San Diego. But it didn’t happen that way.”

Valerio said he learned from Eagles general manager Harry Gamble at the 1991 Maxwell Awards that the Birds had their eye on him.

“He said ‘If the Chiefs hadn’t snatched you up you were our next pick’” Valerio said. “At first it was a huge thrill to think of that but then I thought about it and got a little depressed. I was like ‘Oh man I could have been playing for the Eagles.’”

Valerio’s locker was between Maas and Dave Szott for the first few years of his career.

“Bill Maas was my first one-on-one an Oklahoma drill my rookie year” Valerio said. “He took me under his wing kept the Delco pride alive and really helped show me the ropes and was a real mentor to me fantastic guy a true professional.”

The trio’s ties to Philadelphia still run deep. Maas still has family in the area that he pays the occasional visit and goes to the Jersey shore every year. He remembers the day Harold Carmichael visited the Newtown Edgmont Little League when Maas was a player in that organization.

“It was a big impact on my life” Maas said.

Valerio had a Bill Bergey jersey that he wore from his youth until college when he grew out of it. It was the only jersey he ever owned as a fan.

Blundin lives in Virginia with his wife Amy and their four sons. He’s the athletic director at Woodberry Forrest School an all-boys boarding school just north of Charlottesville. He still has an autographed Bergey jersey that hangs in a closet with a jersey from his time with the Chiefs.

“It’s going to be a fun game to watch” Blundin said. “I will say that our kids growing up were more Eagles fans than Chiefs fans just pulling for the Eagles all the time. You pull for the Chiefs when you watch them.”

All three will be watching the game Sunday when the Eagles and Chiefs square off for the Lombardi Trophy Maas in attendance and Valerio and Blundin from their respective homes.

As to which team they think will win?

“I think the Eagles are a better team just from watching them” Blundin said. “I think they’re more talented and a more veteran group. I think it’s incredible what the Chiefs have done with such a young team.”

“I think it’s going to come down to the trenches” Maas said. “Philadelphia is great on both sides of the ball. They get after the quarterback and have that great offensive line. I think it’s going to come down to the interior guys. I know I’m biased because I was one of those guys. They both have specialists. It’s going to come down to who can handle the pass rush the best and who’s going to be best on the ground.”

“It’s going to be a great game between two heavyweights” Valerio said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vb3BveWkuY29tL3dvcmxkL3doby1pcy1iaWxhbC1tdXNoYXJyYWYtZm9ybWVyLXBha2lzdGFuLXByZXNpZGVudC1wZXJ2ZXotbXVzaGFycmFmcy1zb24v0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9vcG95aS5jb20vYW1wL3dvcmxkL3doby1pcy1iaWxhbC1tdXNoYXJyYWYtZm9ybWVyLXBha2lzdGFuLXByZXNpZGVudC1wZXJ2ZXotbXVzaGFycmFmcy1zb24v?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Who is Bilal Musharraf former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf’s son?,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vb3BveWkuY29tL3dvcmxkL3doby1pcy1iaWxhbC1tdXNoYXJyYWYtZm9ybWVyLXBha2lzdGFuLXByZXNpZGVudC1wZXJ2ZXotbXVzaGFycmFmcy1zb24v0gFjaHR0cHM6Ly9vcG95aS5jb20vYW1wL3dvcmxkL3doby1pcy1iaWxhbC1tdXNoYXJyYWYtZm9ybWVyLXBha2lzdGFuLXByZXNpZGVudC1wZXJ2ZXotbXVzaGFycmFmcy1zb24v?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025625B91D50>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The effort doesn’t involve Las Vegas.

In the past month Las Vegas Sands has been linked to potential gaming development opportunities in the New York City area and Texas. The company is willing to spend billions of dollars in both locations to regain its American foothold.

Sands is among several Strip and regional gaming operators seeking one of three licenses that would place a multi-billion-dollar casino resort near the nation’s most populous city and within the largest metropolitan region in the U.S. Most analysts believe two of the licenses are already spoken for leaving a high-stakes battle for one lucrative opportunity to locate within reach of more than 20 million people in southern New York and northern New Jersey.

Meanwhile the company has committed to spending millions of dollars to push casino legislation in Texas one of the largest states without regulated commercial casinos or legal sports betting. Sands is the primary financial backer of the Texas Destination Resort Alliance (TDRA) a grassroots coalition that is asking lawmakers to allow Texans to vote on a statewide constitutional amendment authorizing the development of destination resorts in Texas’ major cities.

Victory is not guaranteed in either state.

“Las Vegas Sands is amongst a long list of interested suitors for the one downstate (New York) license a license award that we believe is tough to handicap given the politics involved” Deutsche Bank gaming analyst Carlo Santarelli wrote in a research note following the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call in January.

“The commentary was brief (but) Las Vegas Sands reinforced their focus on geographical expansion with Asia and large-scale domestic opportunities remaining the sole focus” Santarelli added.

Gaming industry adviser Brendan Bussmann said both New York City and Texas have been on the radar of Sands and other major casino operators for more than two decades. He said Sands “has been the one company that has remained committed to getting Texas across the finish line.”

Bussmann the managing partner of Las Vegas-based B2 Global said Sands has “carried the water while others continue to stay on the sideline on the destination resort issue.”

Following last year’s $6.25 billion sale of The Venetian The Palazzo and The Venetian Expo Sands focused on its five Macau resorts and Singapore’s Marina Bay Sands which combined for $4.1 billion in revenue in 2022 — a 3 percent drop from 2021.

Las Vegas Sands committed to spending $3 billion over the next four years to renovate and expand its flagship Singapore property. The company expects to spend roughly $1.4 billion in Macau through 2024 on capital improvements at its properties and its commitments associated with a recent 10-year gaming concession renewal from the Macau government.

At the end of 2022 Sands had available cash of $6.31 billion and access to $2.48 billion in financing. However the company had $15.95 billion in long-term debt. Sands which has maintained its corporate headquarters in Las Vegas has long coveted Texas and New York City.

“For us we're very focused on return on invested capital” Sands President Patrick Dumont said in January during the company’s fourth-quarter conference call in response to an analyst’s question about New York.

“In every market that we're in we're typically the largest trade partner with the small and medium enterprises” Dumont said. “We're looking to develop deep community routes so we can support the community and really show this industry is something that can benefit everyone.”

Longing for New York City

Sands – which has dropped the Las Vegas name from much of its corporate presence even though the company’s stock is still traded under the LVS symbol – has traveled both of these casino expansion paths before.

Company founder Sheldon Adelson who died in January 2021 hired high-profile lobbyists in a failed effort to launch a New York City casino approval process years ahead of the 2023 timeline mandated by the state. Adelson wanted to build a resort next to the Javits Center one of the busiest convention centers in the United States.

However that site was claimed last year by Wynn Resorts which announced a partnership with New York-based Related Companies to seek a gaming license for Western Yards at Hudson Yards.

In January Sands announced plans to seek approval for a casino resort on Long Island which is in Nassau County roughly 36 miles east of Manhattan. The 80-acre site houses the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum the former home of the NHL’s New York Islanders.

“This is not a regional casino” Las Vegas Sands Chairman and CEO Rob Goldstein said during the company’s conference call when he casually referenced a $4 billion to $5 billion cost for development and construction.

“This is a full-blown resort with [meetings incentives conferences and exhibitions] entertainment retail (and) restaurants” Goldstein said. “It's the real thing. It's not meant to be a small-time investment.”

Stifel Financial gaming analyst Steven Wieczynski remarked on Sands’ optimism in a research note saying the process would be ultra-competitive.

“We think an integrated resort in New York would represent an attractive way for Las Vegas Sands to re-enter the U.S. market and deploy the proceeds from its Las Vegas Strip asset sale” Wieczynski wrote.

Goldstein said New York’s potential casino business would be a unique opportunity for the company given the region’s size and scope. With two other casinos targeting Manhattan and the surrounding communities he suggested all three casinos could be profitable.

“We’re going all the way in and building something transformational that drives tourism” Goldstein said.

In addition to Wynn and Sands Caesars Entertainment offered a casino proposal for Times Square with developer SL Green Realty Corp. Oklahoma’s Chickasaw Nation is part of an effort on Coney Island and Florida’s Seminole Indian Tribe through its ownership of Hard Rock Entertainment is reportedly in talks with New York Mets owner Steve Cohen for a casino on Willets Point near the team’s stadium.

Most analysts expect two of the licenses will go to MGM Resorts International and Resorts World which already operate New York City-area casino facilities at two horse racing tracks. The casinos only offer slot machine-like video lottery terminals.

Macquarie Securities gaming analyst Chad Beynon said he considers Sands “to be a serious contender for a New York casino license given its track record in (convention and meetings business) and non-gaming (history).”

New York may take much of 2023 to sort out the licensing process.

Another attempt to lasso Texas

It’s unclear what will happen in the Texas Legislature this year. A bill supported by the TDRA and filed in January requires voter approval in November to allow one Las Vegas-style casino resort in each of the state’s four major metropolitan markets – Houston Austin Dallas-Fort Worth and San Antonio.

Limited gaming would be allowed at racetracks while Indian tribes with electronic bingo facilities could add slot machines and other forms of gaming if voters approve the referendum.

In the last 10 years Sands-backed casino expansion efforts have failed to win support. Texas lawmakers meet for 140 days every two years.

“Gambling legalization in Texas is still far from a foregone conclusion” Wieczynski wrote in a research note. “The situation will likely take time to play out given competing interests and bureaucratic red tape in the jurisdiction.”

Casino proponents are also armed with a study undertaken by the University of Houston’s Hobby School of Public Affairs that found 75 percent of Texans support casino legislation.

“Texas has historically had strict laws regulating most forms of gaming even as neighboring states have expanded opportunities for casino gambling” said Renée Cross senior executive director and researcher at the Hobby School referring to commercial casinos in Louisiana and tribal casinos in Oklahoma.

“Opponents have historically had powerful allies in the Legislature but we found the public appears ready to back major changes in how Texas regulates gambling” Cross said.

Researchers found Democrats were more likely to favor expanded gambling than Republicans but support cuts across racial ethnic partisan religious and generational lines.

“It’s not just that a majority of Texans support expanded gambling. We found a majority of people in urban suburban and rural areas support it” said Mark Jones senior research fellow at the Hobby School and political science fellow at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.

Bussmann suggested the positive polling results may sway lawmakers.

“This is the biggest opportunity for investment and jobs in the Texas market that continues to grow as the state sees an influx of people moving from other states” Bussmann said.

Sands executives have avoided commenting publicly on Texas but the company hasn’t shied away from financially backing the effort.

According to the Dallas Morning News in 2021 Sands hired 76 lobbyists at a cost of $6.7 million. As of the first week of the 2023 legislative session Sands had brought on 63 lobbyists with a mandate to spend up to $5.9 million. The newspaper cited data from the Texas Ethics Commission.

The roadblock in Texas is Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick a conservative Republican and staunch anti-gaming opponent.

However Republican Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott both expressed openness to casino expansion at various times in 2021.

“If there is a way to create a very professional entertainment option for Texans Gov. Abbott would take a look at it” an Abbott spokesperson said in a statement to The Texas Tribune last year.

Phelan whose district borders Louisiana said in January he opposes slot machines in convenience stores but thought casinos can be “high quality” destinations “that create jobs and that improve the lifestyle of those communities.”

Sands formed a political action committee Texas Sands PAC that contributed $2.2 million to statewide officials and dozens of lawmakers from both parties during the 2022 campaign.

The PAC has been almost entirely funded by Adelson’s widow Miriam Adelson who became the company’s 58 percent majority shareholder after her husband died. Abbott received $200000 from the Sands PAC and an additional $1 million donation from Miriam Adelson personally.

Texas is surrounded by legal gaming including tribal casinos in Oklahoma that draw customers from the Dallas-Fort Worth area and Louisiana where casinos along Interstate 10 see business from Houston.

“We’re monitoring the situation in Texas given our presence in Louisiana” said Boyd Gaming CEO Keith Smith whose company operates five casinos in the neighboring state.

Texas is the No. 2 feeder market to Las Vegas behind California in terms of airline passengers according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. In 2021 the state accounted for almost 1.9 million arriving airline passengers 1 million behind California.

Sands won’t be alone in Texas — MGM Resorts hired lobbyists for the session. Most analysts predict Houston billionaire Tilman Fertitta who owns the five Golden Nugget casinos in Las Vegas Laughlin Atlantic City Louisiana and Mississippi won’t stay on the sidelines.

Last summer Caesars Entertainment CEO Tom Reeg said the casino giant would “look for a way to participate” if a major market “like Texas” were to open up.

Penn Entertainment owns racetracks near San Antonio and Houston and has lobbyists in Texas.

CEO Jay Snowden said this week he has spent time in Texas and having lobbyists watching “sets us up really well if and when something does happen. We believe (Texas) could be a real significant opportunity and exciting one for the company.”

Texans could also see a referendum on legalizing mobile sports betting. The Texas Sports Betting Alliance was formed as a coalition of professional sports teams and sports betting companies – including DraftKings and FanDuel. The group hired former Gov. Rick Perry as spokesman.

“It’s going on it’s gonna continue to go on and the state of Texas needs to regulate it and make sure that its citizens’ information is protected” Perry told The Texas Tribune.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1zdHJpcC1jYXNpbm9zLW1ha2UtYS1waXRjaC1mb3ItYS1odWdlLXByb2plY3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Las Vegas Strip Casinos Get Behind a Huge Project,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vdHJhdmVsL2xhcy12ZWdhcy1zdHJpcC1jYXNpbm9zLW1ha2UtYS1waXRjaC1mb3ItYS1odWdlLXByb2plY3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x0000025625895150>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The rap superstar is premiering his residency with the nightlife company March 19 at Encore Beach Club. Tyga (acronym for Thank You God Always) is further booked through September at the Encore Beach Club Beach Club at Night and XS Nightclub.

“I’m excited to join the Wynn Las Vegas family and to have the opportunity to connect with my fans at such iconic venues” said Tyga. “These shows are created to celebrate and completely immerse my fans to the experience of my music.”

Tyga (legal name Michael Ray Stevenson) most recently headlined in Tao Group clubs and at “The Forbidden City” Halloween shows in October with special guest Sourmilk at Hakkasan Nightclub at MGM Grand. Steve Aoki and Lil Jon were also featured in the series.

Tyga broke out with the anthems “Rack City” “Ayo” and “Taste.” His latest single “Nasty” a collaboration with Chris Brown moved into the top 20 on the U.S. rhythmic charts. His hit “Sunshine” reached No. 1 on rhythmic airplay with more than 60 million streams.

The 33-year-old rap star is consistently in the top 30 of Spotify’s most-streamed artists.

For Las Vegas purposes Tyga is a proven performer a Grammy-nominated recording star and a long-running Strip headliner.

“Tyga is a great addition because he diversifies our roster of predominately mainstream EDM headliners” Wynn VP of Nightlife Ryan Jones says. “He is an award-winning artist and a cultural phenomenon who has made his Vegas presence a major success. He has a loyal fan base that attends his shows and we’re excited to begin this new adventure with him as a part of our talent lineup.”

Jones says Tyga’s move from a rival nightlife operator indicates Las Vegas’ opportunities across many classes of live entertainment.

“Las Vegas is a competitive landscape with a variety of entertainment for visitors to select from and that also allows artists the opportunity to choose from numerous performance venues and brand collaborations” Jones says. “We are fortunate that Tyga decided to join Wynn Nightlife but more importantly we are excited that Las Vegas continues to be a leading destination where all calibers of artists aim to have residencies.”

By Phillip Moyer |

Modern Family star Ariel Winter is celebrating her 25th birthday in Las Vegas and she’s doing it in style. In an Instagram photo she shared this week the actress is seen wearing a short green dress while hanging out at the Wynn Las Vegas. Specifically she’s at the award-winning XS Las Vegas nightclub at the Wynn’s Encore Resort where she reportedly celebrated with her “favorite people” in what she says is her favorite city.

The photo was posted in the early hours of January 30 the same night that electronic musician Surf Mesa was scheduled to perform at the club. This means that Ariel Winter likely celebrated her birthday dancing to “Taken Away” “Lose My Mind” or “Another Life.”

Well best-known for appearing in all 11 seasons of the sitcom Modern Family Ariel Winter has had a very active career — especially in the field of voice acting. She’s lent her voice to almost 40 different TV shows movies and video games including multiple Final Fantasy games the animated adaptation of Batman: The Dark Knight Returns and the long-running children’s TV series Sophia the First. She has also appeared in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit Safelight and Jericho.

The club that Ariel Winter attended the XS Las Vegas has been a mainstay of The Wynn’s expanded Encore resort since its opening in 2008. It has won multiple awards since its opening such as the Best Mega-Club award and Best Nightclub in Las Vegas award from the Nightclub and Bar Awards along with being listed on DJ Mag’s top 100 clubs list. It is a well-known destination for New Year’s Eve parties in Las Vegas and regularly hosts fashion and charity events.

With the club being so prestigious it’s probably not surprising to find out that Ariel Winter is not the only celebrity to be spotted there. Superstars such as Leonardo DiCaprio Brittany Spears and Jamie Foxx have all been spotted at the XS Las Vegas. The club also attracts major talent including Marshmello The Chainsmokers and Diplo.

This is not the first time that Ariel Winter has posted about her love of the Wynn Las Vegas. In 2021 Winter previously posted about a visit to the Delilah Lounge at the Wynn – a supper club that boasts fine dining and live musical performances. Winter called the experience “incredible” while posing in a sleek black dress.

Like XS Las Vegas Ariel Winter’s appearance at the Delilah Lounge makes her one of many celebrities who have been spotted there. Justin Bieber and Kylie Jenner have regularly been spotted at the lounge since its opening in 2021. Post Malone Megan Fox and Russell Wilson have also been spotted at the establishment.

Beyond her time enjoying the Las Vegas nightlife Ariel Winter has kept herself busy. She appeared in the short film Bully in 2023 and is working on Pools Don’t Log Off and the TV Series Hungry. She has also campaigned for charitable organizations focusing on education children’s health and welfare and animal rights.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiiQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1jb2x1bW5zL2luc2lkZS1nYW1pbmcvbmV3LXlvcmstdG8tbWFrZS1hLXNwbGFzaC1ieS1ob3N0aW5nLTMtbmV3LWNhc2luby1wcm9qZWN0cy0yNzI0MDI5L9IBjQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5yZXZpZXdqb3VybmFsLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9idXNpbmVzcy1jb2x1bW5zL2luc2lkZS1nYW1pbmcvbmV3LXlvcmstdG8tbWFrZS1hLXNwbGFzaC1ieS1ob3N0aW5nLTMtbmV3LWNhc2luby1wcm9qZWN0cy0yNzI0MDI5L2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,New York to make a splash by hosting 3 new casino projects,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.reviewjournal.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /business/business-columns/inside-gaming/new-york-to-make-a-splash-by-hosting-3-new-casino-projects-2724029/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000256258979A0>, 'Connection to www.reviewjournal.com timed out.

“Going forward I see the same thing. It’s mainly just people who want their own power” he said. “They want the solar just so they don’t have to count on others.”

In areas of 50000 population or less which includes the city of Minot the grants available to businesses to add solar energy have increased from a 25% grant to a 40% grant with an additional 30% tax credit and ability to take depreciation.

“It’s kind of an amazing opportunity for folks” Latendresse said. “If a farm or business you are crazy not to because you have so much incentive.”

Keller Paving and Landscaping in Minot brought a solar energy system online in September 2020.

Randy Westby controller at Keller explained the company decided to place solar roof panels on its large building when moving its asphalt plant from Velva into Minot.

“We were already a pretty good user of electricity and we were going to double or triple our usage. So it was a good time we thought to look into it” he said.

The solar power produced is cycled into the company’s overall operation. Westby said there are no storage batteries so excess production is sold to Xcel Energy and when solar production falls short of needs the system seamlessly draws power from Xcel.

Westby said Keller Paving’s system was sized based on expected energy use so that solar would cover the needs most of the time. He said the system works quite well.

“It’s producing the amount of electricity it’s supposed to produce or a little bit more” he said.

Westby concedes solar panels are expensive with a 15- to 20-year payback on the investment.

“But then you have to assume the price of electricity is going to be going up also so you’re kind of hedging the future of your costs” he said. “The tax consequences for the businesses are a pretty strong factor in the decision. And with the current political situation I think those credits are going to get to be more and more valuable.”

Westby said several other businesses have taken interest and inquired about Keller’s system.

“It’s not good for everybody” he said. “You have to kind of fit into the right circumstance.”

The same might be said for homeowners.

Sheila Stafford rural Surrey is one homeowner who has found solar works for her.

Stafford who has lived near Surrey for about three years had installed a solar energy system at her rural home in Illinois about a year before moving to North Dakota.

“It just came about that a lot of neighbors were getting them” she said. “Once one person does it and you have a little information about it then you find it interesting. And also Illinois offered a really good rebate program.”

At the time her North Dakota system was installed there was a 17% tax break for homeowners.

Stafford’s solar panels are ground-based to stay away from tree shade with the energy cabled the distance of about half a city block to the house.

Her North Dakota system differs from her former Illinois system in the current availability of storage batteries. Batteries formerly were bigger and more expensive she said. Batteries offer a source of power when sunlight isn’t available particularly at night.

Stafford’s system uses 12 batteries. From spring into fall her system largely produces what she needs feeding any excess power to Verendrye Electric Cooperative to be used as a credit against future draws on the electrical grid.

Verendrye Electric has seven accounts from which it purchases solar said Tom Rafferty member services and communications manager. The buybacks represent a small amount of power overall and all the solar accounts do require power from the grid at times he said.

He added that individuals and businesses installing solar should contact their utility companies in advance to arrange for interconnect agreements and ensure electrical codes are met. The utility whether Verendrye or another provider also can help the consumer calculate the payback period on a solar system he said.

Xcel Energy which serves Minot and some other area communities reports it has differing rate structures related to purchasing solar power from customers so residents should contact the company. Customers with solar systems that are less than 100 kilowatts are able to sell back the unused energy per the North Dakota tariffs. Customers with systems greater than 100 kilowatts need to be evaluated by Xcel engineers and are subject to a Power Purchase Agreement.

During the short cloudy days of late December Stafford was purchasing from Verendrye because solar production wasn’t enough to fill her batteries and provide for her needs at night.

Even on cloudy day she saves money though Stafford said. She compared a recent $60 bill for electricity use to a $300 monthly bill when she first moved in and didn’t have the system installed yet.

“I like saving money” Stafford said. “I’m happy not having a power bill six seven months out of the year.”

The estimate is 15 to 20 years to get her investment back but her reason for installing solar hasn’t been entirely about the cost savings. Stafford said she wanted a backup plan that ensures that regardless of any government action weather event or other source of potential energy disruption she would not be left powerless.

“It’s just security” she said.

Latendresse said solar systems do lose some efficiency over time but they typically carry 25- to 30-year warranties that they will operate at least at 85% efficiency. Having a south-facing roof is ideal but an east or west roof loses only 20% in efficiency he said.

North Dakota ranks 13th or 14th in the nation for solar quality. Latendresse said cold weather is part of the reason North Dakota ranks so well. Solar panels see declining power production above 75 degrees because the heat takes away from the power. Cloudy days can reduce the power production but even a cloudy day can typically see 30-40% efficiency he said.

Latendresse said there is another reason besides tax credits to look at solar now as compared to in the past.

“The panels are way better and the price is lower” he said. According to the Solar Energy Industries Association prices in North Dakota have dropped 52% in 10 years.

The manufacturing base is there and the number of companies that install the systems is growing Latendresse said. For his company it is now just a matter of keeping up with demand.

“I either have to get ready to grow or limit myself” he said.

Solar in North Dakota

North Dakota ranked 51st in the country for solar installations in 2022 according to the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA). The association reported there were 149 N.D. homes with solar power as of fall 2022.

Nationwide as of fall 2022 more than 3.8 million solar energy systems with a capacity of 135.7 GW had been installed in the United States and 255037 Americans were working in the solar industry SEIA stated.

North Dakota ranks 46th in projected growth of solar with an estimate of 508 MW over the next five years.

Assuming no loan the average N.D. homeowner would save $18042 over the lifetime of a solar energy system according to EcoWatch.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnR3aW5jaXRpZXMuY29tLzIwMjMvMDIvMDQvY2hhcmxleS13YWx0ZXJzLWxvcmUtcm9kcmlndWV6LWdldC1wZXJtaXNzaW9uLXRvLWRlbGF5LXBheW1lbnQtZm9yLXRpbWJlcndvbHZlcy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Charley Walters: Lore Rodriguez get permission to delay payment for Timberwolves,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.twincities.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /2023/02/04/charley-walters-lore-rodriguez-get-permission-to-delay-payment-for-timberwolves/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x000002562F0AF370>, 'Connection to www.twincities.com timed out.

New York CNN —

Meme stock mania was supposed to be over right? Guess what: It’s not.

Sure the entire market did well in January. But many of the Reddit/WallStreetBets darlings of two years ago were particularly strong performers.

Shares of movie theater chain AMC (AMC) have soared nearly 65% so far in 2023 and AMC (AMC)’s companion preferred stock (which trades under the ticker APE as a nod to the nickname AMC (AMC) fans have given themselves on social media) has more than doubled.

Meanwhile Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) has gained about 30% despite rumors of an imminent bankruptcy filing and more store closings. And shares of GameStop (GME) sort of the OG meme stock from 2021 are up more than 25% as well.

Speculative investors are going all-in on crypto too. With bitcoin rebounding from a 52-week low of about $15600 to a current level of just under $24000 Coinbase shares have skyrocketed an astonishing 140% since the end of 2022.

Then there’s Cathie Wood’s ARK Innovation (ARKK) exchange-traded fund a poster child for speculative bets that owns Tesla (TSLA) Zoom (ZM) Roku (ROKU) and Coinbase among its top holdings. This ETF has had an incredible start to 2023 surging more than 40%.

Market history repeating itself?

So did investors learn nothing from last year’s market meltdown? I wrote last week about how one strategist dubbed this year’s market madness as a “flight to crap.”

Others are a little less critical of the so-called junk stock rally but they are still worried this won’t end well.

“I’m concerned generally. I don’t agree with this market rally in meme stocks” said Erik Ristuben chief investment strategist with Russell Investments.

Ristuben said he still thinks odds are greater than 50-50 that the economy is heading toward recession. If that happens lower-quality stocks should get hit hard.

Another strategist agrees this recent rally for meme stocks and other speculative bets may not end well.

“At the start of every year you typically see a mean reversion. The stocks that went down a lot at the end of the previous year get bought” said Michael Sheldon chief investment officer with RDM Financial Group at Hightower. “But this year’s sharp rally and rebound in beaten down names has been an extreme example of that.”

The trouble with meme stocks and other speculative companies is that they are often struggling to sustainably make money. They are story-driven companies rather than businesses that have solid earnings and cash flows.

GameStop for example posted a net loss of $95 million in the third quarter of 2022. AMC reported a loss of about $227 million.

“Investors should not ignore the fact that owning an unprofitable company and hoping it eventually makes money is expensive” said Ronald Temple chief market strategist with Lazard. “The markets are excessively exuberant.”

Temple worries that investors are once again getting swept up by momentum and aren’t stopping to think about how much risk they are taking on with meme stocks.

“There is a little bit of a fear of missing out” Temple said. “That partly explains the lower quality aspect of this rally.”

Consumer comeback?

Of course many companies are actually profitable. And investors will be preparing for another torrent of corporate earnings reports this week.

Big banks oil giants and tech titans have led the earnings parade so far. But now consumer companies get ready for their closeup.

Among the many retail restaurant and entertainment companies on tap to report their latest results: CVS (CVS) Yum Brands (YUM) (owner of KFC Pizza Hut and Taco Bell) Chipotle (CMG) Disney (DIS) Tapestry (TPR) (parent of Coach and Kate Spade) Mattel (MAT) and Pepsi (PEP).

Recession worries and inflation jitters hurt consumer stocks in 2022. But some Wall Street experts think these companies are due for a major comeback this year as pricing pressures fade.

“Inflation is slowing sharply” said strategists at Evercore ISI in a recent report. They upgraded their outlook on consumer discretionary stocks saying the sector “has once again taken up its traditional ‘worst to first’ role.”

“Consumer Discretionary has a proven track record of outperformance even if growth is subpar in 2023; the key is that while the inflation remains high the trend of inflation is demonstrably falling” the Evercore ISI strategists said.

So investors will be listening closely to what executives at big consumer oriented firms have to say in earnings conference calls with analysts about the outlook for 2023. If they’re upbeat about spending that could keep the rally in consumer stocks going.

The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) ETF has soared almost 20% so far this year.

Costco is a force of nature (well figuratively speaking). Sure very little appears to distinguish the big box warehouse chain from its wholesale-centric competitors like Sam's Club or BJ's Wholesale Club other than the fact it doesn't call itself Costco Club. But if you look closely there's a penchant for superior quality from Costco that seems to set it apart. At least it does when it comes to its beloved (and generic) in-store brand Kirkland Signature.

Now Costco isn't the only business known to offer deeply discounted generic items to its customers. And while the price of Kirkland Signature products is undoubtedly enticing — with those items costing 20% less (or more) than similar name brand alternatives at Costco (via CNN) — the exceptionally high quality seems just as responsible as the price for members' sustained loyalty. Of course there's a not-so-secret reason why Costco's Kirkland brand inspires such joy and devotion in consumers: Many of those items are simply name brand products sold under the Kirkland banner.

In fact while many Kirkland-brand items disguise the original manufacturer other Kirkland Signature products are almost stunningly honest about the (often well-known) companies manufacturing them. Frankly there's a seemingly never-ending list of name brands masquerading as Costco's generic in-house products. From coffee to batteries to numerous types of alcohol we've gathered some of the more notable examples and present those name brands hiding behind Costco's popular Kirkland products.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vcmVzdGF1cmFudHMvdGFjby1iZWxsLW1lbnUtYWRkcy10aGUtY3Jpc3B5LW1lbHQtdGFjb9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taco Bell Puts an Old Favorite Back on Its Menu (But With a New Name),ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/restaurants/taco-bell-menu-adds-the-crispy-melt-taco on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vcmVzdGF1cmFudHMvdGFjby1iZWxsLW1lbnUtYWRkcy10aGUtY3Jpc3B5LW1lbHQtdGFjb9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen
