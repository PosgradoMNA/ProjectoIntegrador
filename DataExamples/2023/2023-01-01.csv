3M announced in December that it’s phasing out a family of harmful chemicals but they’re not going away.

The “forever chemicals” known collectively as per- and polyfluorinated substances or PFAS are used in everything from carpeting to nonstick pans to dental floss. The chains of carbon-fluorine bonds are excellent at repelling stains grease and water and even snuffing out dangerous fuel fires. But they also don’t break down in the environment and they linger in people’s bodies for years.

Research has linked the chemicals to developmental and immune problems fertility issues and some cancers.

Maplewood Minnesota-based 3M which is facing a cascade of lawsuits over the PFAS it helped pioneer in the last century said it would stop making and using them by 2025 including at its plant in Cottage Grove Minnesota.

In the view of Rainer Lohmann director of the University of Rhode Island’s STEEP lab and an authority on PFAS contamination: “The nightmare hasn’t really stopped.”

Researchers and environmental advocates said the persistence and global scope of the pollution from the chemicals will pose a cleanup challenge for years to come. They also worried new manufacturers could step in to fill a gap left by 3M and they said the company should contribute to environmental cleanup.

“While it is great that they are moving away from these chemicals finally after pressure after liability after pressure from government regulators … they certainly should not be left off the hook for accountability” said Melanie Benesh vice president for government affairs with the Environmental Working Group an advocacy organization.

3M has already been engaged in cleanup efforts in connection with legal cases and environmental enforcement. It paid the state of Minnesota $850 million to settle a lawsuit over natural resource damages in 2018 and before that it had to excavate contaminated material from several dumps used by its chemical plant in the east Twin Cities metropolitan area. The company also entered into a consent agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency this November to test and treat drinking water in a 10-mile area around its chemical plant in Cordova Ill.

It also faces continuing scrutiny around its Cottage Grove plant where there’s an open investigation into its water discharges by the EPA and Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. 3M first revealed the investigation to investors in 2020.

MPCA spokeswoman Andrea Cournoyer declined to comment on the inquiry.

In an email she wrote that the agency “welcomes” 3M’s plan to stop production and that it “will continue to hold 3M and other entities accountable for their PFAS pollution as appropriate.”

Sean Lynch a spokesman for 3M also declined to comment on the investigation.

He wrote in an email that the company “will continue to fulfill its commitments to water stewardship as well as remediation of PFOA and PFOS at certain locations where we manufactured or disposed of these materials.”

New technologies are being tested to clean up PFAS — including a machine designed to concentrate the chemicals in foam on top of water which the MPCA is using in the east metro.

But there are still few known ways to destroy the chemicals and they’re so routinely found that researchers often refer to a “background level” that’s present in the blood of most people.

“Any place we do find it we basically know it was put there by someone or some process we created” said Matt Simcik a professor of environmental chemistry at the University of Minnesota who has studied PFAS contamination for decades.

3M is still coping with the legacy of two of the oldest and best-studied formulations of the chemicals PFOS and PFOA. The company announced in 2000 that it would phase them out. But other companies such as DuPont didn’t until much later. The chemicals are routinely found around the planet today. One recent study revealed such high levels in rainwater that they exceeded limits set for drinking water by the EPA.

“PFOS was very much a 3M product and we’re still worrying about it 20 years after they phased it out” Lohmann said.

The contamination problem is a more complex one than other prominent contaminants such as PCBs Simcik said. The hazardous organic chemicals were used widely in electronics finishes and plastics until their manufacture was banned in the United States in 1979. They tend to stick to particles so over time some of the PCBs left in the environment in places like the Great Lakes have settled into soils and been covered Simcik said.

“That big chunk is still down there and buried so it’s not a problem” he said.

That’s not the case with PFAS which move readily through water and keep coming into contact with people and animals.

Then there’s the question of what could replace the chemicals. Simcik and Lohmann both worried about what the properties of new chemicals could be.

3M has not divulged how it will replace the chemicals that provide $1.3 billion in annual sales.

Asked whether the company would do health or safety testing on PFAS replacements Lynch wrote that “3M is committing to innovate toward a world less dependent upon PFAS. 3M’s products are safe for their intended uses.”

The other main manufacturer in the United States is Chemours a spin-off of DuPont which has used several formulations of PFAS in its line of Teflon products.

Asked whether the company was considering stepping away from PFAS spokeswoman Cassie Olszewski wrote in an email “Chemours is committed to fluorine chemistry and its power to enable world-changing technologies that help solve some of the world’s most challenging problems.”

Fresh after winning the Allstate Sugar Bowl with the Crimson Tide the 21-year-old can focus on his NIL deals until Alabama's next opponent is revealed.

The Name Image and Likeness deals have become a huge talking point in college football over the last year or so. Many young students have already signed several deals to promote themselves and their bank accounts thank them for it.

Young is no different. Well perhaps he is a little. Given that he is a quarterback and the face of Nick Saban's team and a highly touted NFL Draft prospect the NIL deals we imagine will be coming thick and fast.

Already a Heisman Trophy winner Bryce Young has again backed that up in 2022 albeit with less numbers than in 2021. Young has thrown for 3328 passing yards 32 touchdowns and just five interceptions in his 12 regular-season games.

With those kinds of numbers and we think declaring for the NFL draft Bryce Young will have no shortage of NIL deals to comb over during the offseason.

But how much money has he made from his NIL deals and endorsements already?

How much has Bryce Young made from his NIL deals?

Allstate Sugar Bowl - Alabama v Kansas State

The 21-year-old has already had his fair share of NIL deals throughout his college career. Now these are all reports as the actual number of his deals is up for debate.

But last offseason it was reported that Young already had an $800000 NIL deal in place. That's good money for a young player yet to make it to the NFL.

It doesn't stop there however. Bryce Young also signed a couple of new NIL deals throughout this season. The first was with Dollar Shave Club a company that sends shaving items like razors through the mail.

His second is with BMW and he got a car in return. That'll work too. He is also reported to have had deals with Onyx Fanatics Cash App per www.on3.com.

Young has a total NIL worth of around $3.5 million per on3.com which is incredible given he hasn't even signed with an NFL team yet.

Headquartered in Massachusetts SES AI Corporation is a manufacturer and developer of Hybrid Li-Metal rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles (EV) and other applications. SES AI was founded on April 17 2012 originally as SolidEnergy Systems. Its Li-Metal batteries combine the high energy density of Li-Metal with the cost-effective large-scale manufacturing of conventional Li-ion batteries. SES has an international presence with operations in Boston Shanghai Seoul and Singapore.

SES takes a systems approach to develop and commercialise Li-Metal batteries and it has three main development tracks namely Hermes – a platform for new material development; Apollo – for engineering capability for large automotive cells; and Avatar – an AI-powered safety software monitoring battery health. The firm has produced more than 15000 multi-layer Li-metal cells on its production lines.

Lithium-metal batteries

While Li-ion batteries are the industry standard for EVs today automakers are placing bets on companies racing to develop the “holy grail” of EV power: lithium-metal batteries. Lithium-metal batteries are much lighter than lithium-ion batteries. Their higher density is expected to offer increased range and faster charging—capable of driving 500 to 600 miles on a single charge. Further it would cut down charge time to minutes.

Financials

The firm has a market cap of around $1 billion. In total SES has raised a total of $600.1M in funding over 10 rounds with their latest funding coming in February 2022 from a Post-IPO Equity round. SES is backed by some of the top global automotive OEMs financial investors cell manufacturers equipment manufacturers and raw material suppliers.

The list of its strategic and financial investors includes energy and chemicals conglomerate SK mining and manufacturing company Tianqi semiconductor equipment manufacturer Applied Materials investment firms Vertex Ventures and Temasek Holdings affiliates of automotive suppliers LG and Foxconn Technology Group and global OEMs GM Hyundai Geely Auto Group and Shanghai Auto. Among this group GM and Hyundai are parties to existing joint development agreements with SES.

Growth

The firm came to the limelight when it entered into Pre-A sample joint development (JDA) agreements with General Motors Hyundai and Honda from 2019 to 2020 and all of them became A-sample JDAs in 2021 (General Motors in March Hyundai in July and Honda in December). SES in 2021 set an aim to have a Lithium-metal battery ready for commercially sold cars by 2025.

The firm set up SES Shanghai in 2019 in the “auto town” of Jiading to leverage the supply chain and engineering and manufacturing efficiency in China and Korea. SES Shanghai was expanded to Shanghai Giga in November 2021. SES added 0.2 GWh with its Shanghai Giga Phase I in March 2022. The 1 GWh Phase II is expected to be ready to use in 2023.

SES Korea was started in January 2022 and Dr Qichao Hu Founder and CEO of SES AI disclosed the Company’s new facility in Chungju in December. The added manufacturing capacity in South Korea will also strengthen ties with SES AI’s joint development agreement OEMs GM Hyundai and Honda.

Hu also showcased a video featuring a successful Electric Vertical Take Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft test flight powered by SES AI’s 100Ah Li-Metal battery pack and AI-powered safety software Avatar.

Future Scope

The company aims to deliver C-sample cells modules and vehicles in 2024 to its JDA automakers and also targets to facilitate commercial production by 2025. The firm is working to build up its supply chains around lithium foil on two fronts – a global China-inclusive one and a North American (China-free) one.

The Mine-to-Men AI software tracks data – such as carbon footprint raw material cost water content cost optimizing battery environments to improve battery health etc. – from “mines” battery materials battery manufacturing vehicle data to recycling – the used batteries become the mine for future batteries. Beyond SES Li-metal batteries the company also teases the idea of commercialising this Mine-to-Men AI. The continuous learning of AI can also potentially be monetized to create entirely new business models such as Battery-as-a-Service BaaS where all the data analytics around raw material cost carbon footprint battery health driver behaviour etc. can all be factored into leasing economics the firm states.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MxMzg1ODk0NzIyMDM4NDAy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bistable electrochromic dual-output array display based on intramolecular proton coupled electron transfer,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1385894722038402 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MxMzg1ODk0NzIyMDM4NDAy0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMTQ0ODYxNzIyMDEwODlY0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Root-shaped antibacterial alginate sponges with enhanced hemostasis and osteogenesis for the prevention of dry socket,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S014486172201089X on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiR2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29tL3NjaWVuY2UvYXJ0aWNsZS9hYnMvcGlpL1MwMTQ0ODYxNzIyMDEwODlY0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

The rapid development of wearable chemical sensors allows the noninvasive detection of analytes in accessible biofluids providing a window into the overall dynamic biomolecular state of the human body. There are several candidate biofluids but most of them have limitations in wearable sensing.

Blood is considered the gold standard for medical monitoring of analytes321. However invasive methods of blood sampling pose a major obstacle for patients especially newborns elderly individuals and hemophobic patients for whom blood sampling can be challenging. Urine is also commonly used as a clinical medical sample but is not suitable for autonomous and continuous monitoring22. Tears contain certain salts enzymes proteins and lipids that can reveal conditions and diseases of the eyes23. However the existing tear sample collection protocols can cause eye irritation and produce reflex tears which can affect the sensor’s test results13. Saliva contains a variety of biomarkers including hormones enzymes antibodies and antimicrobial agents that can accurately reflect human status24. Unfortunately however saliva monitoring is also a challenge as the mouth may contain many impurities such as food particles that affect the reliability of the data. The concentration of analytes in tissue fluids is very similar to that in blood15. However it is necessary to use a fine needle or subcutaneous excitation current to collect samples which can irritate the dermal tissue and cause discomfort25.

In contrast to other biofluids sweat has tremendous advantages in wearable sensing. Sweat regulates the body’s heat balance26 and plays an important physiological role in thermoregulation moisturization immune defense and electrolyte and pH balance2728. It contains a wealth of substances that could potentially convey physiological information about the body8293031 and can indicate the health status of the body at the molecular level2232. In addition sweat is secreted by sweat glands that are widely distributed across the entire body. Thus sweat can be obtained in a noninvasive manner at suitable locations on the body ideal for continuous monitoring. Sweat sensors can be placed close to locations of sweat generation allowing for rapid detection before analytes biodegrade. Some analytes in the blood such as glucose33 lactate34 and ethanol35 have been reported to correlate strongly with the levels of chemical molecules in sweat. In a way blood analysis can be replaced by sweat analysis. Although sweat measurement still has some issues with data reliability and the secretion mechanism of some analytes is still unknown the advantages of sweat over other biofluids are rapidly bringing it to the forefront of wearable technology innovation36.

Biomarkers in sweat

Sweat is rich in biomarkers: electrolytes (e.g. sodium potassium chloride ammonium calcium) metabolites (e.g. glucose lactate alcohol) trace elements (e.g. iron zinc copper) small molecules (e.g. cortisol urea tyrosine) neuropeptides and cytokines82230. As sweat contains a wealth of physiological information wearable sweat sensors have a wide range of promising applications in areas such as fitness tracking and health monitoring in high-performance sports for athletes as well as disease diagnosis and medical monitoring121 (Table 1).

Table 1 Key analytes in sweat and associated health conditions Full size table

Electrolytes

Water molecules are the most common component of sweat making up ~99% of its contents37. Sweat is slightly acidic with an average pH of 6.3 which is more acidic than blood38. PH measurements can reflect changes in the concentration of various electrolytes in sweat thus conveying information about the disease and metabolic activity30. In addition local monitoring of pH helps in wound healing detection of infection and treatment for metabolic alkalosis39. Na+ and Cl− are the most abundant electrolytes in human sweat40 and are the driving force for the entry of water into a sweat which can be used to assess the magnitude of the sweating rate41. At the same time Na+ is an important biomarker of electrolyte imbalance in the human body and is essential for the regulation of osmolality water balance and pH42 especially for athletes who exercise for long periods or those exposed to heat and humidity43444546474849. Chloride analysis in sweat has been used as the gold standard for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis50. Sweat collection and detection methods by iontophoresis can provide rapid screening for cystic fibrosis disease1751. The concentration of potassium in sweat is proportional to that of potassium in the blood. Low levels of potassium in sweat may indicate dehydration which in addition to causing muscle cramps may be life-threatening in patients with cardiovascular disease5253. Monitoring Ca2+ levels in sweat can predict diseases such as myeloma acid–base balance disorder cirrhosis renal failure and normocalciuric hyperparathyroidism54. Ammonium levels in sweat are directly related to plasma ammonium concentrations. Ammonia secretion in sweat can be used as an indicator of protein metabolic breakdown and can be used to monitor changes during the transition from aerobic to anaerobic exercise94155.

Metabolites

Glucose in sweat is a representative molecule and is a typical indicator for studying sweat secretion pathways sweat production rates and dilution of analyte concentrations. It has been reported that iontophoresis-induced glucose levels in sweat may correlate with glucose levels in the blood making it suitable for diabetes screening and monitoring333. Apart from this a recent study demonstrated that the use of glucose-loaded liposomes (GLLs) can be used for competitive colorimetric immunoassays of small-molecule antibiotics such as streptomycin (STR)56. The concentration of lactate in sweat is very close to that in blood and can be used as a sensitive marker of tissue viability and may provide a warning for stress ischemia1157. It has also been shown that the sweat secretion rate and lactate content are independent of each other and are very suitable for noninvasive diagnosis58. Studies have shown that sweat ethanol concentration is highly correlated with blood ethanol concentration which allows continuous noninvasive blood alcohol monitoring by monitoring sweat alcohol concentration1635. Uric acid (UA) levels in sweat can provide insight into kidney disease59. It has been reported that UA levels in the sweat of patients with gout are higher than those of healthy individuals and UA has been widely used in the clinical treatment of gout6061.

Drugs and trace metals

As the body excretes toxins so can drugs be secreted in the sweat62. Chronic caffeine overdose can lead to health problems such as coronary syndrome hypertension and depression. Caffeine concentrations in sweat have been reported to correlate with plasma and urine caffeine concentrations63. The concentration of levodopa in sweat is correlated with that in plasma. The monitoring of levodopa in sweat can provide a basis for dose optimization64.

Sweat is one of the most important routes for the detoxification of heavy metals65. Perspiration represents an important pathway for the secretion of zinc. Trends in zinc concentration can be used as an indicator to monitor the body for stress and immune system-induced muscle damage6667. It is extremely important to determine the loss of zinc during physical activity by monitoring zinc in sweat. Serum copper is used as an indicator to detect rheumatoid arthritis Wilson’s disease and cirrhosis of the liver. In addition the levels of copper and other heavy metals in sweat can reflect physical exercise heat stress and diet6668.

Other analytes

In addition to the ions and molecules mentioned above there are also hormone-like molecules and small molecule proteins in sweat such as cortisol neuropeptides and cytokines4. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is an inflammatory pluripotent stem cell factor consisting of 212 amino acids69 that affects insulin activity and has the potential to be used to monitor immune responses in cancer therapy70. A recent study showed that IL-6 is released upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 (causing COVID-19) and stimulates inflammatory pathways as part of the acute phase response71. Cortisol is a steroid hormone that is released by the body in response to psychological and physical stress and therefore plays an important role in the body’s stress response regulation of metabolism and immune response7273. Tyrosine is a conditionally essential amino acid61 that is closely related to metabolism and abnormal tyrosine concentrations can indicate metabolic disorders such as tyrosinemia74. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is involved in the body’s stress response and is found in higher concentrations in the sweat of patients with depression than in that of people without depression75.

Sweat stimulation

Sweat samples can be obtained by two approaches: the passive approach and the active approach. In the passive approach people intensely exercise such as by running cycling or performing other physical exercises to induce sufficient sweat secretion. In the active approach people are subjected to electrical stimulation.

Iontophoresis is a widely used method of active sweat induction allowing the acquisition of sweat samples while the body is sedentary22. As shown in Fig. 1a a current is generated under the skin surface by applying a voltage between the iontophoretic electrodes allowing the agonist (e.g. pilocarpine molecules) to be delivered to the sweat gland at the anode and stimulating the secretion of sweat. This method has been applied to monitor levels of chloride17 ethanol167677 and glucose7879.

A wearable sweat alcohol biosensing device based on iontophoresis achieved further innovations in maintaining the data integrity of sweat samples35. As shown in Fig. 1b the device isolates sweat irritants from the skin with a membrane that effectively prevents sweat from diluting the irritants. Sudomotor axon reflex sweating is used to help minimize mixing between fresh sweat and old contaminated sweat. The use of carbachol as an agonist facilitates a longer and more stable rate of sweat production. In addition the “hex wick” material is used in the coupling of sweat to the sensor which can effectively prevent skin contamination and transport the sample to the sensor quickly reducing the latency time caused by fluid sampling.

Compared to single biofluid monitoring simultaneous analysis of sweat and ISF could expand the scope of detecting biomarkers and improve clinical accuracy. Figure 1c shows a study demonstrating the possibility of a dual epidermal fluid sampling system80. This biosensing system is achieved by the parallel operation of reverse iontophoresis ISF extraction from the skin in the cathodic chamber and ionophoresis in the anodic chamber to supply a sweat-inducing drug (pilocarpine) into the skin at different locations. It successfully achieved the simultaneous detection of alcohol in sweat and glucose in ISF. This parallel sweat and ISF monitoring combine the advantages of both to expand the range of detectable biomarkers and enhance the accuracy of the detection results. In the future this approach to biofluid stimulation could be extended to other biomarkers in sweat and ISF for additional medical applications.

However the conventional iontophoresis technique tends to corrode the electrodes and cause strong irritation causing skin discomfort. To address this problem a programmable current source is used to periodically induce sweat and an upper limit of the ion electroosmotic current is set as a safety mechanism which can effectively avoid overheating and burning of the skin (Fig. 1d)17.

Sweat collection and microfluidic devices

There are two ways to collect sweat samples. One way is to use disposable gauze absorbent pads arm bags and gloves to extract sweat81. Some commercial sweat collection devices direct sweat produced by the skin into a sealed chamber. For example the Macroduct collection system can induce sweat by Pilogel® Iontophoretic Disks and detect chloride in sweat to compare sweat tests used in diagnosing cystic fibrosis (CF)1082. The drawback of this instrument is that an additional device is required for sweat analysis; thus it cannot realize in situ sweat analysis.

Compared with blood or other body fluids the content of biomarkers in sweat is lower which is not conducive to reliable and accurate real-time monitoring of sweat. Addressing this challenge requires significant advances in sweat collection and transport. One promising method is to channel the generated sweat through a microfluidic tube into a reservoir for sample storage and analysis. Sweat collection can be enhanced by minimizing sample leakage evaporation and contamination improving the temporal resolution and accuracy of sweat analyte measurements. Microfluidic devices require a driving force to ensure the continuity of sweat delivery. In addition to using the sweat glands themselves as a pressure source to drive the fluid capillary force osmotic pressure and evaporation pumps can all activate sweat delivery without the need for complex external equipment12. Capillary force promotes the flow of sweat along microfluidic channels (Fig. 2a)83. By adding a valve structure or hydrophilic treatment of the channel surface the direction of sweat flow can be further controlled (Fig. 2b)84. To achieve a shorter sampling time and higher sampling efficiency a hydrogel can typically be placed at the inlet of the microfluidic chip. There is an osmotic pressure difference between the hydrogel and the sweat thus fluid is pumped into the microchannels (Fig. 2c)85. Furthermore by designing micropores at the outlet of the microfluidic chip an evaporation-driven micropump can effectively achieve a continuous flow of sweat. The flow rate can be easily controlled by changing the number or shape of microperforations (Fig. 2d)86.

Joseph Wang’s group further extended the principle of microfluidic sweat sampling by integrating an electrochemical biosensor into the reservoir of the microfluidic device for the first time enabling real-time continuous monitoring of sweat metabolites such as glucose and lactate18. The device combines the advantages of electrochemical epidermal sensing and the microfluidic device. A short sweat sampling time fast sweat flow rate and efficient transmission over the detector surface are achieved and the problems of sweat mixing and skin-worn chemical sensors are solved. A key bottleneck in sweat analysis using microfluidics is to achieve uniform high-throughput manufacturing of sweat sensor components. To overcome this challenge a microfluidic sensing patch manufactured on a large scale by introducing a roll-to-roll (R2R) process allows real-time measurement of Na+ K+ and glucose in sweat. Furthermore most of the reported wearable microfluidic platforms are based on silicon elastomers which require complex manufacturing processes and expensive microfabrication equipment87. One promising manufacturing technology is CO 2 laser engraving which allows for rapid engraving of patterns under ambient conditions and reduces personnel training and process optimization. Figure 2f shows an entirely laser-engraved sweat sensor. It is reported to allow wireless continuous monitoring of uric acid (UA) tyrosine (Tyr) and vital signs in sweat. The sensing platform employs two laser engraving modes: a grating mode for chemical sensors and a vector mode for microfluidic patterns as well as physical sensors. This multimode microfluidic sensor patch can be fabricated on a large scale and it has the ability to achieve efficient microfluidic sweat sampling sensitive molecular sensing and multiplexed vital sign sensing61.

However in most cases strenuous exercise or pharmacological stimulation is required to produce sufficient quantities of sweat for analysis. The low secretion rate and rapid evaporation of sweat at rest limit the volume available to be collected in a sensor. For patients who are unable to exercise or who are sensitive to the burn of the skin by iontophoresis a sweat collection method that uses a waterproof skin-contact microfluidic system that can capture the natural release of sweat is a good solution88. However this method can only capture sweat after warm water showering or bathing and cannot continuously analyze thermoregulatory sweat at rest. Recently a microfluidic-based sweat patch has been successfully developed to achieve continuous measurement of the at-rest thermoregulatory sweat composition and rate. As shown in Fig. 2g the device consists of three parts: a microfluidic layer an electrochemical sensing electrode and a laminated hydrophilic housing. The sweat collection wells of the microfluidic layer are filled with SU8 padding coated with hydrogel which can quickly absorb sweat at a low secretion rate effectively solving the problem of dead volume89. This wearable sweat sensor fills a gap in the field of devices for the continuous detection of resting sweat and helps better study correlations between sweating rates and sweat composition.

Electrochemical sweat sensor components

Wearable electrochemical sweat sensing systems require precise measurement of biomarkers in sweat with different sensing modalities depending on the characteristics of the target analytes. To meet the needs for lightweight small size portability and comfortable attachment to the skin the sensor material needs to be flexible and stretchable. At the same time electronic modules and wireless communication strategies need to be integrated to realize real-time sweat analysis and power consumption needs to be considered. In this section we introduce these elements.

Electrochemical detection methods

Electrochemical detection methods have the advantages of high sensitivity high selectivity fast response time and simple wearable design. Currently most electrochemical sweat sensing devices base their measurements on amperometry potentiometry and voltammetry4. The main considerations in the selection of the sensing method are the characteristics of the target biomarker in sweat especially its molecular properties and concentration range21. In addition to the detection methods mentioned above there are also gas-based contactless electrochemical biosensors. Compared with traditional electrochemical biosensors gas-based contactless sensing interfaces can be separated from the bioassembly platform effectively avoiding the complex process of biological assembly on the sensing interface thus having better reproducibility and stability90. It is worth noting that photoelectrochemical detection which is an important branch of electrochemical detection has superior sensing performance and has become a research hot spot in analytical chemistry in the past few years91. Although we have not seen any reports on sweat sensors using photoelectrochemical detection methods combining photoelectrochemical detection with sweat analyte detection is extremely promising in the future.

Potentiometry was used to determine the changes in ion concentration in a solution by measuring the potential between the sensing electrode and the reference electrode. By this method selective detection of Na+742 K+752 Ca2+54 NH 4 + 11 and pH92 in sweat solutions has been successfully achieved. In addition potentiometry has been developed for the detection of protein-specific immunosensors. The output signal can be effectively amplified by modifying oligonucleotides on gold nanoparticles. Amperometric sensors have a three-electrode structure that includes a working electrode where the analyte reacts a fixed-potential electrode that serves as a reference for the working electrode and a counter electrode used as a collector. For example glucose93 lactate11 and alcohol1635 can be detected by modifying selective enzymes on the electrode surface and detecting the current generated by the redox reaction of the analyte with the enzyme. The voltammetric sensor also has a three-electrode structure where a voltage scan is applied between the working and reference electrodes to cause a redox reaction with the target analyte. By measuring the peak redox current the concentration of the target analyte is deduced. Unlike potentiometry or amperometry voltammetry can measure multiple analytes simultaneously. There are three main types of voltammetry: square wave solvation voltammetry (SWASV) cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV). SWASV is generally used to detect trace metals in sweat such as copper zinc and gold666768. CV and DPV are suitable for drug detection in sweat for example for caffeine63 by DPV and levodopa64 by CV.

Wearable devices are in direct contact with the skin and require the ability to detect the wearer’s physiological information continuously and stably minimizing interference with the wearer’s daily life. Therefore the basic material requirement for wearable sweat sensors is to conform to the geometry of the skin which needs to satisfy flexibility and stretchability while maintaining ideal electrochemical and mechanical stability. Materials with relatively low Young’s modulus are mostly selected as substrates and currently the commonly used materials for flexible sensors are fabric paper flexible polymers and plastics9495 (Fig. 3).

Conventional flexible substrates are currently composed mainly of polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET)7 polyimide (PI)96 polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)979899 polyurethane (PU)100 and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA)101. These polymer films have excellent properties suitable for wearable devices such as low cost good biocompatibility excellent physical–mechanical properties and electrical insulation properties. The microstructure of the device is equally important to improve the sensitivity and response speed of flexible pressure sensors. It has been reported that a flexible pressure sensor with a saw-toothed microstructure made of two crossed PDMS films enables simple and fast detection of target concentrations102. However the mismatch between these substrates and the epidermis leads to sweat accumulation making the test results inaccurate. they also have poor breathability and stretchability making them usable on the skin for only a short period.

In contrast textile-based platforms provide natural breathability for the underlying skin promoting natural sweating and evaporative cooling9 and they have high flexibility softness and comfort103. Moreover the textile-based approach can be integrated into existing garments such as socks19 and T-shirts104 making sweat monitoring more versatile. Fabric-based wearable sensors are currently fabricated in two main ways. One approach is to print fully formed sensors onto fabric via a screen printing process which can provide mass production of low-cost reproducible textile sensors53. Another approach is to form thread-based sensors that can be processed into the fabrics themselves. For example a smart textile electrochemical sweat lactate sensing device was reported assembled by weaving three different functional stretchable gold fiber electrodes into the fabric to monitor the lactate concentration in sweat maintaining high performance even under high tensile strain105. Advances in textile-based sensors have offered considerable advantages in the field of on-body monitoring devices as they conform with the wearer’s anatomy while enabling unobtrusive sensing. However the implementation of fabric-based electrochemical sensors relies on screen printing or applying coatings to fabrics leading to inhomogeneity and variability due to the core wicking/diffusion of inks on unevenly textured fabric surfaces. Recently to address this issue a bottom-up approach was proposed that used individual functionalized threads woven together as a substrate and encapsulated as a patch to form a wearable multiplexed sweat-sensing platform9.

Paper is also an ideal substrate material with excellent properties such as low cost easy preparation good biocompatibility and the inherent wicking ability of hydrophilicity. Through hydrophilic and hydrophobic material modification wax dyeing inkjet printing and photolithography self-absorbing sweat microfluidic channels can be generated in paper-based devices relatively easily. At the same time the softness and foldability of paper facilitate the reduction of device size and the construction of devices with multiple functions31. For example Tang et al. used paper as an electrode to fabricate a flexible pressure sensor for point-of-care immunoassays significantly improving the sensitivity of target detection106. Apart from this paper-based analytical devices have been successfully used in fluorescent immunoassays offering the prospect of mass-produced miniaturized devices107108.

In electrode manufacturing graphene has attractive applications in electrochemical sensing due to its fast electron mobility high current density and large surface area. Among the most promising two-dimensional (2D) active materials exemplified by graphene MXene with its hydrophilic surface and high electrical conductivity excels in various applications such as sensors catalysis and energy storage. It has been reported that the properties of graphene frameworks can be improved by doping CuxOpolypyrrole conductive aerogels reducing the weakening due to severe aggregation through strong π–π interactions. This conductive aerogel has been successfully applied to the detection of antibiotics and hydrogen sulfide with excellent performance109. Ti 3 C 2 T x  representative of the MXene family has a unique 2D morphology good biocompatibility and is promising for its application in designing advanced nanohybrid systems for detecting antigen antibodies proteins and enzymes110. Meanwhile Ti 3 C 2 MXene has a high photothermal conversion efficiency and is suitable for photothermal immunoassays111 and it can be used to achieve immobilization of biomolecules112. Compared with ordinary electrode materials the silk fabric-derived intrinsically nitrogen (N)-doped carbon textile (SilkNCT) has an inherent hierarchical structure and porous mesh weave structure which facilitates good contact with reactants and effective electron transfer. With these unique properties silk-derived carbon fabrics have a promising future as working electrodes for wearable electrochemical sensors113.

Methods for fabricating electrodes on flexible substrates include photolithography and printing methods. The screen printing method is a standard sensor manufacturing technique with low cost and is suitable for mass production114. Compared to screen offset or flexographic printing the simple printing mechanism of roll-to-roll gravure allows for faster print speeds higher resolution and consistency thus facilitating large-scale high-throughput manufacturing on flexible substrates of up to 150 m115. Lithography including the use of CO 2 laser engraving offers the advantage of high resolution and allows for rapid engraving of patterns in ambient conditions and reduces personnel training and process optimization61. Nevertheless lithography has the disadvantages of expensive instruments and complicated steps which limit its wide application.

Electronic components

Electronic components are a very important part of wearable sweat sensors. The signal generated by the sensing element ultimately needs to be transduced conditioned and processed by the electronics to filter out the noise and calibrate and compensate for the signal. Additionally to facilitate observation wireless transmission protocols are required for transferring and visualizing the collected information to the terminal device382122.

For a general wearable sweat sensing device the main body of electronics consists of an analog front-end to condition the sensor signal an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) a preprogrammed microcontroller to calibrate the signal to a concentration value and a wireless communication component to forward this signal to a paired cell phone application for assessment7. One of the key roles of electronics is to filter the raw sensor signal to eliminate noise. Motion and interference between various sensing methods are among the sources of noise generation116. Analog front ends can use low-pass filters to eliminate high-frequency noise from motion or fluctuations in the sensing layer environment. Some successful sweat sensing platforms utilize hybrid electronics that integrate flexible sensing substrates with traditional silicon integrated circuits for signal processing and transmission. Various topologies and substrates including soft plastics and polymers with printed conductive elements or flexible PCBs are available for electronic components717117118119.

The choice of wireless communication protocol depends on a series of criteria such as power consumption data generation rate bandwidth requirements and compatibility with other sensor circuits120. Bluetooth low energy (BLE) with a wireless communication range of up to 100 m has been widely applied in wearable devices. In one example a fully integrated sensing array was connected to a microcontroller and Bluetooth module for measuring sweat metabolites electrolytes and skin temperature7. Nevertheless the high energy consumption of BLE is still unsatisfactory. The near-field communication (NFC) approach allows for signal transmission using the power of the receiving device to trigger sensor measurements and data collection without the need for a battery-power transmission component inside the sensor. NFC is widely deployed in wearable microfluidic devices. For example NFC coils have been integrated with epidermal microfluidic devices to capture store and analyze sweat electrolytes in aqueous environments121. However the current problem of NFC is that its wireless communication distance is only 10 cm or less21 requires the participation of the users to complete the information transmission and cannot automatically function continuously. RFID is another wireless communication standard that has been applied to wearable electrochemical sweat sensors119. RFID chips allow potential sensing of electrolytes in sweat and skin surface temperature with minimal components and can be used for hydration and thermal stress monitoring.

To facilitate the observation of data many wearable electrochemical sensing devices have applications that can remotely initiate sensing and record data which can be viewed on the displays of portable phones and watches177388121. In addition applications that transform sensor data into useful information that can be mapped to final health or fitness parameters (e.g. hydration levels and fatigue) through calibration curves and feedback control algorithms would be very useful.

Power components

The support components in wearable devices for data processing and wireless data transmission require power to operate. Moreover in terms of practicality wearable devices require the ability to operate continuously for long periods. Therefore reducing power consumption and developing efficient wearable energy systems are major considerations for wearable devices. Current wearable energy resources fall into two main categories: lithium-ion batteries and energy harvesting devices122123124.

Lithium-ion batteries offer the advantages of long operating life and fast recharge. However it is difficult to make a sufficiently small lithium-ion battery and thus they do not meet the needs of wearable devices. Efforts have been devoted to making lithium-ion batteries suitable for wearable forms. For instance a flexible and stretchable battery has been made by placing the cell components of a conventional battery on an elastomeric substrate123. However lithium-ion batteries can also easily explode and cause safety problems. To minimize the risk of overheating lithium-ion batteries expanding and exploding protective layers have been designed for these batteries that can cause the battery to be powered off in the event of overheating125. Zinc-manganese batteries based on quasi-solid water electrolytes eliminate the safety problems of batteries and are lightweight and environmentally friendly and have high output voltage and high capacity making them one of the most promising alternatives to conventional batteries.

Meanwhile to meet the growing power demand of wearable electronic devices and to avoid frequent interruptions in charging and cumbersome wired power transmission wearable systems integrate energy harvesting devices such as solar cells triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and microbial biofuel cells (BFCs) to achieve self-sustainable operation32. Through flexible photovoltaic cells that can collect solar energy and convert it to the energy required by sensors there is a stable self-powering capability and high energy storage capacity to support the continuous functionality of the system. Figure 4a shows a smartwatch that uses flexible photovoltaic cells for energy collection/conversion and flexible zinc-manganese batteries as energy storage devices to continuously monitor sweat glucose levels without external charging facilities93. The sensor exhibits stable self-power with a high energy storage capacity to support the continuous functionality of the system.

BFCs can convert molecules such as glucose lactate uric acid and ethanol present in biofluids into energy to power sensors and implanted devices including pacemakers pumps and stimulation electrodes. Human sweat can be used as an ideal sustainable bioenergy source to power wearable sweat sensors126. In 2018 the first wearable and scalable self-powered biosensor were reported19. As shown in Fig. 4b a highly stretchable textile-based BFC was fabricated by utilizing a screen printing process based on stretchable custom inks and a custom stencil and electrode design allowing the extraction of electrical energy from sweat for the detection of lactate. The great potential of self-powered sensing and energy harvesting operations in the field of wearable sensors has been fully demonstrated. However epidermal BFCs can only generate and transfer energy in the presence of sweat. Different levels of sweat lactate BFCs can limit the constant power output due to irregular sweating. In addition the limited BFC output voltage requires additional electronic components which limits the flexibility of the overall device. Supercapacitors may provide the solution. Using a sweat-based BFC to derive energy from lactic acid and then storing it by an integrated supercapacitor (SC) can provide stable energy output over long periods and maintain good rechargeability127. Due to their excellent performance lactate fuel cells have recently been successfully integrated into multimodal wearable sweat sensors. As shown in Fig. 4c a perspiration-powered integrated electronic skin (PPES) which can be fully driven by sweat uses a unique zero- to three-dimensional nanomaterial integration that further improves the power strength and long-term stability of the BFC enabling selective continuous monitoring of key metabolic analytes (urea NH4+ glucose and pH) in sweat128.

TENGs convert mechanical energy generated by human movement into electrical energy through the coupling of induction and frictional electric effects129. Since they operate independently of uncontrollable external sources such as sunlight or wireless power transmitters they can power wearable sweat sensors during intensive physical activity. For example as shown in Fig. 4d a wearable freestanding-mode TENG (FTENG) converts the mechanical energy generated during human movement into electrical energy and integrates efficient power management integrated circuit (PMIC) to store and release the energy. Energy can be efficiently harvested from human skin and continuously powered for wearable devices130.

As a high-capacity capacitor that stores much more energy per unit volume than available batteries or electrolytic capacitors ultracapacitors can withstand more charge/discharge cycles and receive or transfer charge at a faster rate. The energy harvesting device collects energy from the environment and then conditions and stores the cleared energy in the supercapacitor which then supplies the stored energy to the wearable sensor as needed131.

In hybrid harvesting systems with multiple energy input modes system-level considerations are needed to guide the wise selection of components with complementary characteristics and commensurate performance to efficiently and reliably remove energy from human activities132. The microgrid is a microscale grid with components for power generation energy storage various utilities and management functions for regulating energy flow133. Such self-sustainable microgrids can operate independently of the main grid harvesting energy from local sources and regulating and storing the removed energy in various energy storage modules. As shown in Fig. 4e energy is harvested from sweat and from exercise using sweat-based biofuel cells and friction nanogenerators while the collected energy is stored and regulated by supercapacitors. The device utilizes limited energy to provide autonomous and sustainable power for wearable devices20.

Typical wearable electrochemical sweat sensors

Sweat is rich in electrolytes metabolites trace elements and various small molecules which provide potential insights into different aspects of human metabolic and physiological states. Wearable electrochemical sweat sensing devices which have been extensively studied recently provide unprecedented real-time access to monitor analytes in sweat offering a powerful method for health monitoring and disease detection. Meanwhile the choice of electrochemical detection technique depends largely on the target analyte. In this section we will introduce some typical wearable sweat sensors based on different analyte types and significant milestones in technological development.

Electrolyte and metabolite monitoring

In the evolution of wearable sweat sensors the detection of electrolytes and metabolites is the most developed and widely applied providing information on body hydration osmotic balance muscle fatigue blood glucose levels etc. For the detection of electrolytes in sweat generally ion-selective electrodes (ISEs) and potentiometric methods are employed. Conventional ion-selective sensors consist of a membrane-based ion-selective electrode and a reference electrode both of which require an internal solution to ensure a stable and sensitive response92. Its advantages include low sample volume requirements miniaturization cost reduction versatility and simplicity of in situ sensing of biological materials134. The assay utilizing enzymatic reaction and amperometry is well suited for the detection of a range of metabolites. These analytes readily undergo redox reactions in the presence of selective enzymes. The concentration of the analytes can be detected by monitoring the current generated by the oxidation or reduction reaction between electroactive substances at a constant potential. This method offers the advantages of simplicity of operation provides a fast and continuous response and minimizes the lag time between noninvasive wearable measurements and blood analyte concentrations.

The history of wearable electrochemical sweat sensors for detecting metabolites and electrolytes is shown in Fig. 5. Early research on wearable sweat sensing platforms focused on single analyte sensing of a wide range of target analytes. In 2013 Joseph Wang’s group developed the first flexible wearable tattoo-based electrochemical sweat sensor for real-time noninvasive detection of lactate in human sweat11. The sensor used a lactate oxidase (LOx)-modified sensing electrode to detect sweat lactate concentration by the chrono-current method with a high degree of selectivity. In addition a traditional screen printing method was employed to create the transfer tattoo. This enabled the sensor to withstand the repetitive mechanical deformation that the epidermis undergoes during movement and the sensor can be easily worn by a person. In a subsequent study the detection range of the sweat epidermal tattoo sensor was extended and the sensor included glucose monitoring135.

Fig. 5: History of wearable electrochemical sweat sensors for detecting metabolites and electrolytes. In 2013 the first wearable electrochemical sweat sensor was developed for real-time noninvasive sweat lactate monitoring11. Subsequently several wearable sweat potentiometric sensors were developed employing ion-selective electrodes and enabling noninvasive monitoring of pH86 NH 4 + 55 K+ 140 Na+ 42 and Ca2+54 in sweat. Wearable sweat sensors for metabolite monitoring such as glucose131 and alcohol16 have also been developed. 2016 saw milestone advances in wearable sweat sensors. For example a wearable sweat sensor for multiplexed biosensing allowing simultaneous detection of multiple analytes in sweat with integrated circuits for signal processing and wireless data transmission was developed7. Copyright 2016 Springer Nature. At the same time a textile-based multi-ion sweat analysis potentiometric sensor with high stretchability was developed53. Copyright 2016 Wiley. In 2017 a wearable sweat sensor that automatically extracts and analyzes sweat was reported designing an electrochemically enhanced iontophoresis interface allowing simultaneous detection of chloride and glucose in sweat17. Copyright 2017 National Academy of Sciences USA. Moreover a commercially available glasses-based electrochemical sweat sensor was developed which detects both potassium and lactate in sweat52. Copyright 2017 RCS. In 2019 a battery-free microfluidic wearable sweat sensor based on lactate biofuel cells was developed133. Copyright 2019 AAAS. An integrated textile sensor patch for real-time and multiplex sweat analysis was reported improving sensitivity and selectivity109. Copyright 2019 AAAS. In 2020 a wearable electrochemical sensing system was developed that integrates sweat sampling electrochemical sensing and data display/transmission on the same platform135. Copyright 2020 AAAS. Recently in 2021 a multimodal wearable biosensor was developed to perform continuous simultaneous acoustic and electrochemical sensing134. Copyright 2021 Springer Nature Full size image

Meanwhile pioneering results have been achieved in electrolyte detection. A new tattoo-based ion-selective sensor was reported92. A polyaniline (PANI)-modified ion-selective electrode was used as the pH-sensitive electrode making the device selective and biocompatible. Combining techniques such as commercial temporary tattoo paper with conventional screen printing and solid contact polymer ISE methods a potentiometric-type electrochemical detection method was used to enable rapid real-time monitoring of pH levels in human sweat during exercise. Subsequently noninvasive real-time monitoring of electrolytes such as ammonium ions (NH4+)55 potassium ions (K+)136 and calcium ions (Ca2+)54 in sweat was achieved. Furthermore polyvinyl butyral (PVB) was employed for the first time as a solid-state reference membrane in a wearable device.

Wires and connectors for data transmission greatly interfere with human activity. An epidermal tattoo potential sensor with the wireless signal transmission was developed in 2014 incorporating several state-of-the-art thick film technologies laser printing technology solid-state potential measurement technology fluid technology and wireless technology. Real-time sodium concentration in sweat can be transmitted to a laptop 10 m away via a wireless Bluetooth transceiver42. Soon after Hickenfeld’s group reported the first wearable sensor that transmitted wirelessly to a user interface achieving a breakthrough in delivering detected information to the user119. The sensing platform is based on a radio frequency identification (RFID) adhesive patch that potentially senses electrolytes in sweat as well as skin surface temperature allowing data to be transferred to a smartphone for analysis and monitoring hydration in sweat.

However all of these previously reported wearable sweat sensing platforms suffer from some drawbacks. Because only a single analyte can be monitored at a time it is not possible to elucidate whether the sensor displays signal changes due to changes in analyte concentration sweating rate or sensor malfunction. In addition these sensing platforms lack in situ signal processing circuitry and sensor calibration mechanisms to accurately analyze physiological states. In 2016 Javey’s group demonstrated a milestone development by demonstrating the first fully integrated multiplexed flexible integrated sensing array (FISA) that selectively detects electrolytes (sodium potassium) and metabolites (glucose lactate) in sweat and measures skin temperature simultaneously7. The sensing component consists of an enzyme-based biosensing current sensor that detects glucose and lactate and an ion-selective electrode (ISE)-based potential sensor that detects sodium and potassium enabling continuous multiplexed measurements. The signal conditioning processing and control circuitry of the integrated circuit assembly and the Bluetooth wireless transmission module are also integrated using FPCB technology to calibrate the raw analyte signals to meaningful concentrations and transmit data via Bluetooth transceiver to a customized cell phone application for data analysis. The sensing platform integrates plastic-based sensors and traditional integrated circuit assemblies at an unprecedented level of integration revealing an extremely promising future for wearable electrochemical sweat sensors. Recently an integrated wearable electrochemical sweat analysis device was reported that simultaneously detects six health-related biomarkers in sweat113. By adopting silk fabric-derived intrinsically nitrogen (N)-doped carbon textile (SilkNCT) with high conductivity as the working electrode the previous wearable electrochemical sweat sensor with low sensitivity and selectivity in measuring multiple analytes simultaneously was successfully surpassed.

These methods however involve a complex collection of hardware and are difficult to miniaturize for the daily convenience of the wearer. A new electrochemical sensing approach is proposed similar to a biofuel cell which does not require additional instruments and the target analytes spontaneously generate electrical signals proportional to their concentration137. Biofuel cell-based electrochemical sensors for glucose and lactate and a device for colorimetric analysis of chloride are integrated on a microfluidic substrate allowing for sweat sample processing with zero crosstalk between different sensors. Small low-power battery-free NFC electronics were selected for wireless data transmission enabling simultaneous monitoring of sweating rate sweat volume pH lactate glucose and chloride.

Sensor integration is now shifting to the combination of different sensor modalities and there have been breakthroughs in the combination of sweat sensors with different biofluid sensors (e.g. interstitial fluid sensors) and physical sensors. Recently a highly integrated multimodal flexible and scalable wearable sensor has been reported which overcomes the engineering challenges associated with different sensing modes and materials; it uses ultrasonic sensors to monitor human blood pressure and heart rate and electrochemical sensors to achieve comprehensive and dynamic self-monitoring of human health status by using lactic acid alcohol and caffeine in sweat and glucose in interstitial fluid (ISF)138.

In addition to traditional epidermal wearable sweat sensors such as patches and tattoos other platform approaches have gained significant expansion. Joseph Wang’s group reported the first fully integrated glasses-based wireless multiplexed sweat sensing platform in 201752. The sensing platform integrates amperometry for detecting sweat lactate and a potential sensor for detecting potassium in sweat on each nose bridge pad of the eyewear. It also integrates an electronic backbone in the eyewear frame to provide control of the current and potential sensors and supports Bluetooth wireless data transmission to the host device. This new eyewear platform offers better comfort and suitability for the wearer and meets the user’s need for esthetics with great commercial potential. A 2020 report demonstrated a smartwatch supporting a stand-alone sensor system with sweat sampling electrochemical sensing and data display/transmission in sedentary and high-intensity exercise situations. In addition by examining the biomarker messaging pathway and identifying near-zero strain regions within the microfluidic-based sensing module the strain isolation pathway was designed to maintain high fidelity of biomarker data which has great potential for large-scale clinical applications139.

Heavy metal and drug detection

Human sweat contains a variety of trace elements that are closely related to the health status of the body. In 2015 Joseph Wang’s group developed the first example of a wearable electrochemical trace metal sensor by applying a bismuth/sodium fluoride-coated electrode with excellent properties for trace metal detection. The sensor uses square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) to achieve real-time monitoring of zinc in human sweat (Fig. 6a)67. Subsequently Gao et al. developed a wearable flexible sensing array using the same electrochemical detection method calibrated and compensated with a skin temperature sensor (Fig. 6b). Multiplexed simultaneous selective detection of heavy metal elements such as zinc cadmium lead copper and mercury ions in sweat was achieved66. A fully printed wearable microfluidic nanosensor has recently been reported that integrates a reverse iontophoresis system and a wireless device for continuous real-time detection and quantification of copper secreted in sweat (Fig. 6d)68.

Drug monitoring plays a crucial role for physicians to accurately adjust drug doses and understand the complex pharmacokinetics of drugs. However in wearable sweat sensing assays the detection of drug molecules is challenging due to their extremely low concentration in biofluids. A wearable sensing platform used for drug detection in sweat was first reported in 201863 (Fig. 7a). Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) based on the oxidation of the target molecule at its unique potential and then measuring the corresponding current was used to allow sensitive determination of the concentration of the measured molecule in sweat. Roll-to-roll printing technology is utilized to enable the mass production of high-performance electrode arrays. At the same time integrated signal transduction modulation processing and Bluetooth transmission functions allow for noninvasive real-time and in situ monitoring of methylxanthine drugs (caffeine) in sweat. This groundbreaking drug detection work greatly facilitates pharmacokinetic studies. Figure 7c shows another breakthrough in drug detection. By adding gold dendritic nanostructures to significantly improve the stability of the electrode noninvasive detection of levodopa in sweat was successfully achieved64.

Other target detection

Sweat has a wealth of other components including cytokines hormones and proteins. By detecting these molecules in sweat a deeper understanding of body homeostatic mechanisms and overall body health can be obtained. However there have been few reports of continuous monitoring of small molecule biomarkers in a sweat over a long duration. The main difficulty is that these analytes change in composition and cause different changes in pH over time and at low concentrations making it difficult to achieve stable detection using electrochemical sweat sensors140. Detection can be performed using antibodies or aptamers for affinity-based sensing22 as well as molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP)-based methods72. For this class of analytes electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) can be used to probe the affinity status of the electrode surface by analyzing the complex impedance in the Nyquist diagram. In addition cyclic voltammetry (CV) can also be used for detection.

In 2017 Prasadt’s group reported a wearable sweat sensor based on functionalized antibodies69. As shown in Fig. 8a nanoporous polyamide membranes are used as substrates to fabricate sensing arrays and capture probes (antibodies) are immobilized in room temperature ionic liquid (RTIL) to improve the stability of antibodies. The sensing platform enables the first combined detection of IL-6 and cortisol in human sweat. The high stability of the sensor performance was also verified using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) ATR-IR spectroscopy and dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques.

Graphene with its large surface area and fast electron mobility properties has superior performance in electrochemical sensing. Competitive immunosensing strategies provide significant advances in the detection of highly selective small hormone molecules. A wireless sensing device combining laser-induced graphene and a competitive immunosensing strategy was developed for rapid reliable sensitive and noninvasive monitoring of the stress hormone cortisol (Fig. 8c). As a result of the study the first cortisol circadian cycle and dynamic stress response curves constructed from human sweat were reported and a strong empirical correlation between serum and sweat cortisol was verified59. Thread-based electrochemical immunosensors were recently reported for the first time enabling the noninvasive detection of cortisol in sweat by immobilizing cortisol antibodies on l-cys/AuNPs/Mxene-modified conductive thread electrodes significantly improving the sensitivity of the sensors141.

Although competitive immunosensing approaches offer high sensitivity their complex sensing procedures make it difficult to meet the needs of wearable applications. MIPs are used to mimic enzyme–substrate or antibody–antigen interactions for the specific recognition of blotted molecules with a range of properties such as high selectivity sensitivity reliability low cost and mechanical thermal and chemical stability142. Figure 8b shows an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) which adopts an artificial recognition membrane based on molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) as a specific recognition element. The limitations of OECTs which are not suitable for the detection of cortisol due to their uncharged nature at physiological pH were overcome. This sensing platform allows stable and selective molecular recognition of cortisol in sweat73. Nevertheless such MIP-based sensing usually requires prolonged physical activity or additional iontophoretic stimulation of sweat glands to obtain sweat which may increase the user’s psychological stress and thus alter cortisol levels leading to inaccurate stress assessment. Figure 8d shows a wearable touch-based cortisol sensor described by Tang et al. The use of a highly permeable perspiration-wicking porous polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel allows for fast and effective sweat collection. Molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) electrochemical sensor technology was used to achieve fast simple and reliable detection of sweat cortisol through a highly selective combination with a cortisol-imprinted electropolymerized polypyrrole coating72. The sensing platform has been experimentally validated to have significant advantages over common cortisol measurements in capturing cortisol levels during sharp fluctuations. This MIP-based fingertip cortisol sensing provides a reliable and practical method for rapid and stress-free pressure monitoring.

Previously the measurement of uric acid and tyrosine in sweat was challenging due to their low concentrations. Figure 8e shows a laser engraved sensor. Utilizing the advantages of graphene in electrochemical sensing rapid and accurate in situ detection of uric acid and tyrosine in human sweat was achieved by using differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) to assess ultralow levels of uric acid and tyrosine based on the amplitude of the peak oxidation current61.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNob3BpZnkuY29tL2VudGVycHJpc2UvYmxvZy9lY29tbWVyY2UtYXV0b21hdGlvbi1zb2Z0d2FyZS1zaG9waWZ5LWZsb3fSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Ecommerce Automation Software: 10 Shopify Flow Workflow Templates (2024),"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.shopify.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /enterprise/blog/ecommerce-automation-software-shopify-flow (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3B8AD40>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNob3BpZnkuY29tL2VudGVycHJpc2UvYmxvZy9lY29tbWVyY2UtYXV0b21hdGlvbi1zb2Z0d2FyZS1zaG9waWZ5LWZsb3fSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYWNjZWxlcmF0aW9uZWNvbm9teS5jb20vYWkvaG93LXByZWRpY3RpdmUtYWktaXMtYXV0b21hdGluZy10aHJlYXQtZGV0ZWN0aW9uLWFuZC1pbmNpZGVudC1yZXNwb25zZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How Predictive AI Is Automating Threat Detection and Incident Response,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiamh0dHBzOi8vYWNjZWxlcmF0aW9uZWNvbm9teS5jb20vYWkvaG93LXByZWRpY3RpdmUtYWktaXMtYXV0b21hdGluZy10aHJlYXQtZGV0ZWN0aW9uLWFuZC1pbmNpZGVudC1yZXNwb25zZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3B8B220>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Prior to the clock striking midnight for East Coast viewers Miley Cyrus and her “Aunt Dolly” served up back-to-back duets of Cyrus’ “Wrecking Ball” followed by Parton’s “I Will Always Love You” — watch the video above.

(On “Wrecking Ball” in particular the juxtaposition of Parton’s softer/sweeter tone during the verses with Cyrus’ balls-out take on the chorus was pretty neat and may have even given you chills.)

Other performances from the NBC countdown special included Miley and David Byrne teaming up for both “Let’s Dance” (find video/poll below) and “Everybody’s Coming to My House”; Dolly and Miley’s “Jolene” duet; Sia singing “Unstoppable” with Byrne; Miley joining Paris Hilton for (what else?) “Stars Are Blind”; Liily performing “Applause” and “Sabotage”; Miley joining Swae Lee for “Party Up the Street”; FLETCHER doing “Becky’s So Hot” as well as teaming with Cyrus for “Midnight Sky”; Latto delivering “Big Energy” and more.

Grade “Wrecking Ball” “I Will Always Love You” and the… interesting… “Let’s Dance” below then weigh in in Comments with your favorite performances of the night.

Gone were Jack Harlow and some questionable comedy bits — save one laugh-free sketch from SNL’s Please Don’t Destroy — and in their stead: Dolly Parton America’s Sweetheart (and Miley’s godmother).

“I tell ya this is the thrill of my life to get to host the show with Miley” offered Dolly. “We know how much I’ve loved her since she was a lil’ ol’ bitty thing. Now she’s a big ol’ thing and I still love her. I will always love you.”

“That’s how I feel about you Aunt Dolly” Miley replied.

Prior to those pleasantries though and a fireworks extravaganza to ring in 2023 the dynamic duo showcased a number of performances from Latto and Fletcher to David Byrne and Rae Sremmurd to Sia and Paris Hilton the latter two joining Miley on Paris’ hit single “Stars Are Blind.”

But the finest performance of the night came from Miley and Dolly who sang a towering medley of Miley’s “Wrecking Ball” and Dolly’s “I Will Always Love You” just before the clock struck midnight.

School Board approves raise for teachers,"BATH CO. Ky. (WKYT) - At last months meeting Bath County School Board members approved a 2% raise for teachers. After some backlash the board reconvened and approved a larger 5% raise this time.

“The districts that have the funds are raising their teachers salaries. We are in a position where we don’t have the economic advantages the other districts have. So if we don’t at least try to compete at least to a 3% on the yearly rate we fall farther and farther behind” said Superintendent Steven Evans.

Superintendent Evans said he’s pushed for a 5% raise because many teachers are looking at positions in other districts or have already left. And he said he can’t blame them.

“Eventually it doesn’t make sense to become a teacher in this county when you can drive down the road and make $10000 more dollars.”

It’s these teachers who filled the board meeting and applauded after learning they’d receive the larger raise.

“This opportunity to give 5 our finance director says she can never remember doing a 5%. So it’s not a game changer but it’s a good boost in the arm for them. And they deserve it.”

All classified personnel will receive a $1 per hour raise as well. Many classified personnel make under $20 per hour and wouldn’t have been eligible for the percentage raise otherwise.

The board previously approved a $1000 stipend with the 2% raise. The stipend was removed with the larger raise tonight.

The Vanguard Self Storage facility is being built at the former Regency Laundry site on the A36 Lower Bristol Road.

The reception area will feature a restored De Haviland Vampire aircraft adding a unique touch.

Vanguard Self Storage one of the UK’s remaining independent providers of self-storage solutions say the new facility marks a significant milestone in their strategic expansion.

The property which had been a laundry dating back to the 1880s had been purchased by a residential developer but faced a rejected planning application.

Vanguard seized the opportunity making an unconditional offer and completing the acquisition in January 2022.

Will McCullagh Managing Director of Vanguard Self Storage said: “We are excited to bring our high-quality self-storage services to the heart of Bath.

“Our new facility not only provides convenient and secure storage solutions but also showcases our dedication to sustainable design and environmental responsibility.”

It has been designed by Bath architects Designscape to blend seamlessly with the city’s architectural heritage.

Vanguard say: “Utilising a combination of Bath stone glazing and bronze cladding the building’s exterior pays homage to the local aesthetic while incorporating modern design elements.”

Mike Lamplough Vanguard’s Head of Property said: “We are committed to providing our customers with the best possible storage experience From the architecturally sensitive design to the state-of-the-art amenities our new Bath store exemplifies our dedication to excellence.”

Sustainability is at the forefront of the project. Key features include a 75kWp solar array on the roof electric vehicle charging bays and a new stream landscape feature that re-naturalises the existing waterway running across the site as well as landscaping to contribute to the promotion of natural habitats.

The new facility will offer 45000sq ft of net lettable storage space spread across four floors and served by two 3.5-tonne Kone lifts.

Each unit will be individually alarmed and the site will be monitored 24/7 by CCTV.

Ben Thilthorpe Head of Operations at Vanguard said: “Following the success of our Bristol store which we opened in 2019 we anticipate that our new Bath branch will be very attractive to business customers.

“We will have units that will be ideal for micro and small companies and a drop-in business lounge.

“The fact that we are only a five-minute walk from the city centre means that we will be providing the perfect location for final mile logistics.”

The Bath store is the latest addition to Vanguard Storage’s growing network of facilities across the UK.

The company have also announced the completion of expansion projects at its Staples Corner and Bristol locations as well as the installation of a new 295kWp solar PV array at their Manchester site."

Harold Hemmings told NBC 6 South Florida news on Thursday that he met his stepdaughter once when her mother passed away from cancer in September last year.

""She (Jellisa Baxter) didn't seem like a bad momma to me... the one time I met her and the baby - once"" he said of the encounter.

""She's sick you know. That's all I can say because right now if somebody is going to pick up a knife - (and kill) yuh one child"" Hemmings lamented in the interview.

The little girl is yet to be identified by the Florida police.

In addition to her mother‘s recent death days before the killing of her daughter Baxter was served with an eviction notice from her North Miami Beach apartment.

Public records obtained by US media said Baxter was unemployed at the time she fatally stabbed the child.

In a 22-second audio call between Baxter and a 911 police dispatcher she said she first tried to strangle her daughter.

""That didn’t work so I stabbed her with a knife in the neck and chest"" Baxter told the dispatcher.

The North Miami Beach Police Department said they took Baxter into custody without incident on Tuesday. She was in the living room of her apartment wearing a white robe and the little girl’s body was nearby.

The mother has since been charged with first-degree murder and aggravated child abuse.

Bond was denied when she appeared in court on Wednesday.",,,,,,

Even for chains that survived the pandemic a spate of closures could be on the horizon for both department stores and large retailers in 2023 in Maryland UBS analysts predicted in mid-December of 2022. (Rachel Nunes/Patch)

MARYLAND — In 2020 and 2021 the coronavirus pandemic forced retailers to change everything about the way they do business. And even as Maryland recovers from shutdowns shifts in consumer buying habits amid nagging inflation have hurt long-standing retail brick-and-mortar businesses.

As the threat of recession looms over Maryland chains could face yet another difficult year with a whole new set of challenges. Months of inflation have caused operating costs at retail spaces to spike and have chipped away at the sales of mid-tier retailers experts said. Even for chains that survived the pandemic a spate of closures could be on the horizon for both department stores and large retailers in 2023 UBS analysts predicted in mid-December of 2022.

""These trends are likely not good for department stores as both luxury companies as well as off-price retailers compete directly with department stores"" UBS analysts Jay Sole Mauricio Serna Shoshana Pollack and Tiffany Agard told Insider. ""We expect department stores to close locations as challenges persist."" “[W]e believe department stores face many challenges ahead” Sole said as reported by RetailDive.com. “We model very weak earnings outlooks for Nordstrom Kohl’s and Macy’s and believe these challenges are not fully appreciated by the market.”

Here are the chains that analysts say might close entirely or close many of their stores in 2023. 1. Bed Bath & Beyond

Bed Bath & Beyond is set to close more than 150 stores across the nation as part of a plan to strengthen business at remaining stores. No Maryland stores have been listed as closing in 2023 so far. In 2020 the retailer closed three Maryland stores in Gaithersburg Hanover (Arundel Mills Mall) and Salisbury.

Here are the current Bed Bath & Beyond stores in Maryland: Annapolis: 200 Harker Place Suite 200

Bel Air: 559 Baltimore Pike

California: 23415 Three Notch Road Unit 9B

Columbia: Snowden Square 9021 Snowden River Parkway

Frederick: Riverview Plaza 5413 Urbana Pike

Gambrills: 2382 Brandermill Boulevard Suite 102

Germantown: 12940 Middlebrook Road

Hagerstown: 17716 Garland Groh Boulevard

Ocean City: 12641 Ocean Gateway

Rockville: Congressional North Shopping Center 1519 Rockville Pike

Towson: The Towson Place 1238 Putty Hill Avenue Suite 1

Waldorf: 3270 Crain Highway

Westminster: 200 Clifton Boulevard 2. CVS

CVS announced in November 2021 that it would shutter more than 900 locations over three years — 300 stores per year. The company said the closures would reestablish a ""new retail footprint strategy aligned to evolving customer needs"" Yahoo reported. 3. Rite Aid In the spring of 2022 the retail chain announced it would close 145 stores before the year's end.

The company cited unprofitability as the main reason to close so many stores. Officials said the closures were meant to ""significantly reduce costs."" 4. Kroger/Safeway/Harris Teeter Grocery stores were hardly spared from the ""retail apocalypse"" which decimated the shopping industry from 2017 to 2020. Two of the nation's largest grocery chains — Kroger and Albertsons — announced a $25 billion merger in October. Kroger closed several stores in 2021 and 2022 and will continue shuttering locations in 2023. Both retailers own grocery stores that are prevalent across Maryland: Harris Teeter and Safeway. There are 60 Safeway stores in Maryland and 18 Harris Teeter stores in the state. Company officials have not said which stores would be affected by the pending merger. ""Closing a store is a difficult decision and one that we take very seriously"" Lori Raya president of Kroger's Mid-Atlantic Division said in a statement after closing a store that opened in 1979 according to BestLife. ""This store's low financial returns made it unfeasible to continue to operate while still upholding our low-price commitment to our customers.""



5. Nordstrom While it's unclear whether Nordstrom will completely fold in 2023 analysts predict that the retailer will be ""under pressure"" in the first half of 2023 Insider reported. The news website also reported that analysts predict a wave of department stores will close in 2023. In August 2020 the Annapolis location of Nordstrom closed the Capital reported. 6. Sears Once a shopping behemoth that sold everything from clothes and toys to house kits the last Sears store in Maryland will close in January 2023. Sears at Francis Scott Key Mall in Frederick will close Jan. 15 a manager told the Frederick News-Post. 7. Best Buy

This struggling electronics retailer has been quietly closing more stores each year. The chain closed 20 locations in 2019 and 20 more in 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic forced mass closures of retailers across the nation. In early 2021 the chain announced plans ""to close a higher number this year."" The company did not reveal the total number of its stores. Media reports suggest that at least 60 Best Buy stores closed in 2021. Best Buy currently has 23 locations in Maryland. In late 2021 the Best Buy at Arundel Mills closed permanently. In a March 2022 Star Tribune article Best Buy executives said they expected business to continue to taper. In a 2022 BizJournals.com article Best Buy CEO Corie Barry predicted that supply chain issues labor shortages and continued outbreaks of COVID-19 globally could lead to unexpected shutdowns of factories that could ripple through the markets she said.

HOUSTON - Shaquille O'Neal is a citizen of the world so we don't see it as unusual that he might swing into our fair city for lunch.

Shaq visiting his son Shaqir O'Neal who is playing basketball for Texas Southern University? Sure!

Shaq checking in on his Texas-based business interests featuring the expansion of his Las Vegas-based ""Big Chicken'' restaurant chain with 50 locations coming soon to The Lone Star State ... and Houston apparently in line to be first? Sure!

Shaq is hungry for a Christmas Eve snack so he swings in to Houston's Kenny & Ziggy's New York Delicatessen ... and ends up using his oversized personality and his oversized wallet to spread some holiday cheer? Sure!

Kenny & Ziggy's posted a photo on social media of Shaq hanging out posing with an employer and smiling that smile ... and noted that the legendary NBA star paid for everyone's meal in the restaurant.

Shaq has been a public presence all over Texas in recent months after having purchased a home in the Dallas area ... and he's also been a generous presence. In August the Hall of Famer bumped into a family at a Best Buy in Dallas and ended up buying them a new washing machine.

We also know that O'Neal pulled over one day in Dallas and interacted with a woman eventually giving the person in need cash and a hot meal.

And how he's giving in Houston.

""You never know who will walk into Kenny & Ziggy’s. Our friend Shaq paid us a visit today. This was his first time at the new store and loved it"" Kenny & Ziggy's wrote on its Facebook page.

Each year high volumes of mosquitoes are caught in GTs and LTs in the NWMAD and MMAD including tens of thousands of potential WNV vectors. Since 2002 many human cases of WNV illness have occurred in the city of Chicago annually despite rigorous mosquito control campaigns and the efforts of dedicated abatement and local health districts working year-round [6]. Evaluation of mosquito species collections obtained using different trapping methods is not precise in terms of determining abundances in a region due to trap-specific biases lack of a systematic collection regimen and non-uniform distribution of equally placed trap types in the study region.

Based on a rich body of historical trapping data that cover the past decade this study provides a reasonable baseline by which Culex species and Cx. salinarius in particular are expected to be collected. Mosquitoes of the genera Aedes Culex Anopheles Coquillettidia and Psorophora accounted for 55.6% 20.6% 19.7% 3.6% and 0.4% of the landing catch respectively. The proportions of Aedes Anopheles Coquillettidia and Psorophora in collections from NWMAD and MMAD were 21.1% and 10.2% 0.6% and 1.0% 0.5% and 0.07% and 0.01% and 0.2% respectively. In contrast proportions of Culex species collected from NWMAD and MMAD were 70.2% and 83.8% in GTs and 3.7% and 4.8% in LTs respectively. Overall HLCs collected higher proportions of non-Culex mosquitoes than GTs or LTs. In a separate study 785 mosquitoes of various species of genus Culex from the North Shore District and NWMAD of Northern Cook County Illinois were collected from GTs and LTs between 2017–2021 and submitted for confirmatory genetic species identification (Fritz et al. unpublished). Only two (0.25%) of these specimens were identified as Cx. salinarius compared to 73.9% of specimens from HLCs. Thus the expected distribution of species collected will depend on the collection method.

Traditional trapping methods are ideal for the efficient collection and testing of potential WNV mosquito vectors. However these methods are only effective in identifying potential vectors and controlling virus activity if testing is conducted frequently because Culex populations are known to rebound rapidly after spraying [18]. Conversely traditional trapping methods appear to collect a limited diversity of mosquito species [36 37]. One possible explanations for this is that other mosquito species may not have a biological preference or attraction to the simulated baiting conditions (e.g. lights CO 2  lures etc.) but a more likely reason is resource strain (e.g. limited human time to sort and identify mass quantities of mosquitoes). HLC collections do not have the same proportions of Culex species that GTs and LTs collect. Additionally the HLC method has two major disadvantages: (i) it is labor intensive and time consuming requiring a lot of human resources per captured mosquito; and (2) the collector’s risks of acquiring mosquito-borne pathogens many of which do not have specific treatments or cures are increased. However HLCs are better suited than GTs or LTs for estimating the community of female mosquitoes specifically seeking human hosts [24]. The potential benefits in a systematic and targeted design may pinpoint hotspots for the highest concentration of human-seeking mosquitoes. When used in a targeted-style approach HLCs can narrow the geographic area of interest and provide a more efficient deployment for controlling potential human-seeking WNV mosquito vectors; however approaches to safeguard the collector’s health must be further developed before widespread adoption of HLCs for monitoring can be considered [24]. Additionally the HLCs in this study were conducted in small natural areas embedded within residential areas. Additional studies are needed to ascertain any influence of HLCs on mosquito ecology within these two intersecting habitats [29]. This study analyzed the results of landing rates based on four human collectors. To evaluate any differences in an individual’s attractiveness we evaluated the rate of mosquito collections per “HLC night” as a method for standardizing collection values across varying periods of exposure. These values indicate no statistical difference in an individual’s attractiveness but future studies should address this question with a targeted design evaluating methods for measuring potential human behaviors characteristics and/or scents that may be interest. Results from this 2-year study have made clear that Cx. salinarius a less commonly reported WNV vector species in the upper Midwestern USA was not only present in the Chicago area but was the most commonly collected WNV vector in HLC collections accounting for 73.9% of all Culex species landings. Conversely the two primary vectors of WNV in the Midwestern USA Cx. pipiens and Cx. restuans only comprised 4.3% and 2.2% of the total proportion of Culex species that landed on human collectors.

Implications for human WNV transmission

Culex salinarius Coquillett mosquitoes commonly known as the unbanded saltmarsh mosquito are among the most competent vectors of WNV in laboratory transmission studies [383940]. The virus has also been frequently isolated from wild-caught specimens [4142434445]. The etymology of the name salinarius pertains to salt but is slightly misleading given that the species appears to tolerate low to moderate levels of salt (3–11 ppt) in freshwater/brackish environments particularly in ponds and other small bodies of water along coastlines [464748]. Historically the range of this species stretches from Maine to Florida and around the Gulf of Mexico to Texas [49]. Although specimens of this species have been collected as far north as Ontario Canada reports pertaining to its overall abundances in the upper Midwestern USA have remained low although its presence has been reported from various locations in the Midwest USA [5051525354]. Despite Cx salinarius and Cx. pipiens belonging to the same genus these two species do not contain high quantities of fat bodies and do not enter a reproductive diapause [55 56]. Instead overwintering is thought to occur in natural shelters and animal burrows and females have been known to seek blood meals at the first signs of mild weather [49]. In addition to not being treated by traditional control methods the natural habitats that enable the winter survival of Cx. salinarius emphasize the importance of incorporating broader vector control measures in different landscapes within urban and suburban environments.

Perhaps the most startling difference between Cx. salinarius and Cx. pipiens is the host blood meal preference. Culex pipiens highly prefers avian hosts and blood meal analyses have revealed that the proportion of mammalian hosts rarely exceeded 15–20% [2 57]. In contrast the host blood meal preference of Cx. salinarius exceeded 60% mammalian hosts and between 35 and 40% avian hosts [12 585960]. When potential implications for WNV spillover in the Midwestern USA are factored in Cx. salinarius provides three potentially critical points of concern: (i) this species is more commonly observed in its northern range leading to new questions regarding the species’ northern geographic limit [61] and it is either not commonly trapped with GT and LT methods or it is not being correctly identified (via morphological methods); (ii) efforts to mitigate potential WNV vectors are not designed for targeting Cx. salinarius given its tendency to breed in natural habitats; and (iii) the high mammalian host preference aggressive biting nature and high vector competence provide the key ingredients for a mosquito to potentially become a highly efficient bridge vector of WNV and other encephalitis viruses [58 59 62].

Upon discovering the high ratio of Cx. salinarius landing rates in comparison to those of any other Culex species in Chicago additional data inquiries were made from prior research conducted in the region. Colleagues from the city of Chicago’s vector control program and a collaborative team working in various sites of Southern Cook County shared their abundance data for comparison (Table 1; Additional file 1: Table S1 Table S2). In summary out of a total of 1476411 collected Culex specimens only 1665 (0.11%) were identified as Cx. salinarius. HLC efforts resulted in 34 Cx. salinarius collections out of a total of 46 Culex specimens (73.9%). HLC efforts totaled 7.87 collections per trap night versus 0.022 collections per trap night for all other collection efforts. Taken together this result equates to HLC collections producing over 364-fold the number of Cx. salinarius mosquitoes than any other effort combined. One caveat to this finding however is the potential for misclassification bias; HLC collections were speciated genetically while other trapping data is generally based on high-throughput morphologic identification which may fail to identify a species that is not expected in high numbers and is morphologically similar to a common species.

Interventions and future research

The surprising abundance of Cx. salinarius in the HLC collections described here in Chicago is a testament to the effectiveness of the HLC collection method [63]. This study provides compelling evidence in support of alternative trapping methods as a useful tool to provide updates on the overall abundance and diversity of potential disease vectors that are targeting human hosts. As a standard public health measure these types of environmental health “checkups” may be needed more frequently due to the rapidly changing forces of the present day such as new introductions of vectors and pathogens.

Public health and mosquito control agencies should consider adding a supplemental plan to their current monitoring and mitigation strategies occasionally conducting surveillance of and/or targeting natural breeding areas where Cx. salinarius may reside (see Additional file 1: Text S1 & Figure S5 for brief habitat analysis). While HLC collection methods are not practical for routine surveillance sparing usage implemented at strategic time periods (e.g. for early season WNV “sentinel” use at or around historical peak human transmission in known “hot spot” human and/or bird transmission locations etc.) could provide added utility and breadth to existing strategies providing important information that may increase the efficiency and knowledge in targeting potential mosquito vectors. With the aid of human scented lures and/or CO 2  traps like BG-sentinels or CDC LTs may also be a viable alternative method for capturing large quantities of Cx. salinarius and other human-host seeking mosquitoes in natural habitats [646566].

While these incidental findings may have implications for the enzootic and zoonotic transmission potential of WNV suggestions from this study remain as hypotheses and should be interpreted as a guide for improving targeted surveillance and WNV mitigation efforts. Onward research demands the frequent and repeated detection of WNV RNA in Cx. salinarius females captured in their environment to substantiate the hypotheses provided in this manuscript. Additional HLC collections should be repeated and include a deeper evaluation of micro-scale factors that may influence a mosquito’s landing preferences including preferred feeding locations on the human body (Additional file 1: Figure S6) microclimate (Additional file 1: Figure S7) and the addition of sampling residential areas.",,,,,,,,,,,,

While not the first Chinese mass-produced aircraft the C919 is the country’s first direct shot at attempting to overthrow the Airbus-Boeing duopoly in the best-selling narrow-body aircraft market segment. The Chinese manufacturer’s other jet the ARJ21 which was recently delivered to the first foreign airline in Indonesia has not amassed the same attention and order book compared with the C919.

However the C919 has also failed to amass similar levels of attention as the Airbus A320 or Boeing 737 families of aircraft. On the one hand it is understandable. COMAC outselling an already-established aircraft type with its own supporting infrastructure would be highly unusual. On the other knowing how tightly controlled business enterprises are in China it is slightly questionable that state-owned carriers have not ordered thousands of C919s from a state-owned manufacturer.

Perhaps there has to be a fine balance between delivering results and supporting the local industry. After all the various A320 and 737 variants have proven to be capable aircraft and have helped airlines save money on fuel maintenance and other costs by being more efficient with each generation. The C919 on the other hand must still be put through its paces before it can even fly passengers. China Eastern Airlines will need to do this before the Chinese narrow-body aircraft begins carrying paying customers in early 2023.

Still the two narrow-body aircraft from the duopoly have sold very well in the country. According to Airbus’ latest Orders & Deliveries data as of November 30 2022 Chinese airlines have ordered 1638 variants of the A320 family including current engine (ceo) and new engine option (neo) aircraft. Meanwhile Boeing’s data as of the same date shows that carriers in the country have signed up for 1348 various variants of the 737 family ranging from the 737-200 to the latest iteration the 737 MAX. Some orders are associated with third-party leasing companies including those based in other countries that have delivered aircraft to Chinese airlines and might not showcase the full scale of orders.

It is no surprise that both Airbus and Boeing have managed to establish a presence in China. The pair have long sought to become the go-to manufacturer for the Chinese government securing business in a country where demand for air travel has blossomed including domestically. Even the COVID-19 pandemic which is still affecting China with strict policies and huge outbreaks should not derail that growth.

But the duopoly’s players have each adopted different approach to handling their business in China.

Emphasizing domestic production in China

The C919 nevertheless could become a headache for executives at both Airbus and Boeing especially considering how much emphasis was put on innovation-driven development in China in the latest five-year plan.

According to a summary by PwC the government considers self-reliance and self-strengthening in science and technology the pillars of national development strategy.

“The innovation-driven strategy is followed by an initiative to build up a modern industrial system” the summary continued emphasizing that the 14th five-year plan has put more emphasis on that strategy compared with the 13th five-year plan. “The Proposals stresses that China will unswervingly build itself into a manufacturing power put more emphasis on quality and enhance its strength in cyberspace and digital technology signaling the focus and general orientation of our roadmap to the future modern industrial system” PwC’s analysis of the latest economic policy in the country continued.

“In addition it also underlines that China will foster strategic emerging industries such as the new generation information technology biotechnology new energy advanced materials high-end devices new energy vehicles green environmental protection aerospace and marine equipment and accelerate the development of modern service industry new infrastructure and digital economy” one of the Big Four accounting firms concluded.

Does this mean that the opportunity for Airbus and Boeing to sell and deliver aircraft will vanish sooner rather than later?

Well the newest five-year plan also reiterated the importance of the dual circulation strategy. According to Breugel an economic think tank established in Brussels Belgium in 2005 since Donald Trump the now-former United States president began his trade war endeavors against China the country has been attempting to rely on a policy that insulates “the domestic market from the rest of the world by eliminating any bottlenecks whether in terms of natural resources or technology so as to vertically integrate its production and achieve self-reliance served by China’s huge domestic market”.

Trade tensions have continued to boil despite a meeting between the current US President Joe Biden and Xi Jinping in November 2022 where the former proclaimed that both sides “can manage our differences prevent competition from becoming anything ever near conflict and to find ways to work together on urgent global issues that require our mutual cooperation”.

The latest flareup was when the US banned the sale of advanced chips and chip-making tooling to China in October 2022 with Biden remarking that 0% of advanced chips were manufactured in the US and that is why “China was lobbying in the United States Congress against passing this legislation [the CHIPS and Science Act – ed. note]”. Those restrictions began to spill over to other countries such as the Netherlands even after the meeting in Indonesia.

And that is where a fundamental difference between the US and the European Union (EU) is shown. The Netherlands while planning on joining the 50-state country in restricting chip access to China would “not copy the American export restrictions one-to-one” stated Liesje Schreinemacher the Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation of the Netherlands in an interview with NRC a local daily newspaper. Schreinemacher also emphasized that talks are not done just yet because “more time is needed for that”.

Diplomacy matters

Still not all trade wars are fought equally and not all of them affect every industry within a region or geopolitical area.

In July 2022 Airbus announced a deal for 292 A320 aircraft with various Chinese carriers and the list includes Air China China Eastern Airlines China Southern Airlines and Shenzhen Airlines. In November 2022 Airbus’ Tianjin Final Assembly Line (FAL) in China began assembling its first A321 aircraft the largest of the A320 family. These are just some of the examples showcasing the fact that Airbus has managed to successfully conduct business in the country. For Boeing though orders from China have been an area of struggle. In the past five years China-designated customers in the manufacturer’s Orders & Deliveries data have ordered 59 aircraft with the last order coming in September 2021. Then Air China signed up for five Boeing 777F cargo aircraft which means that the last passenger aircraft that was ordered by a China-based company was the 737 MAX when the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China’s (ICBC) aircraft leasing arm ordered three of the type in August 2020.

Interestingly though China “recycled” the 292-strong Airbus aircraft order from July in November 2022 when the state-owned China Aviation Supplies Holding Company (CASC) announced a deal for 140 aircraft from the European Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM): 132 A320-family jets and eight A350s. The day of the announcement correlated with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s visit to the country. Industry sources noted that the eight A350s were already ordered in 2019 while the narrow-body aircraft part of the deal was already included in Airbus’ backlog in July 2022 according to Reuters.

Announcing deals in coordination with diplomatic visits was nothing out of the norm in China or in the aviation industry for that matter. When then-French President Jacques Chirac visited the country in October 2006 Airbus announced a deal for 150 A320 aircraft and most importantly the manufacturer and Chinese officials finalized an agreement to establish the Tianjin FAL starting in 2008. Airbus broke that record by agreeing to an order for 160 jets destined for Chinese airlines in November 2007.

That record-breaking order also coincided with an official visit from Nicolas Sarkozy the successor to Chirac.

Boeing’s relationship with the country is much more complicated. When China ordered the first aircraft from the Seattleite OEM in 1972 the US did not even have a formal diplomatic relationship with China. The first order was for 10 Boeing 707 aircraft the first-ever jetliner from the manufacturer and came shortly after Richard Nixon visited China the same year in a visit that is considered an icebreaker. Akin to European leaders’ visits when George Bush traveled over the Pacific Ocean in November 2005 Boeing officially shook hands with Chinese officials for 70 737s during the then-President’s visit to Beijing China. When Donald Trump another ex-US President visited the Asian nation for the first time in 2017 a deal for 300 aircraft was announced. However according to a Chicago Tribune report the announcement included – much like the Airbus order – already backlog-booked aircraft.

Boeing’s difficulties in China

Turning back the clocks a few decades reveals that this story has repeated itself in modern times as Boeing struggles to gain new orders from China.

Even already-built aircraft namely 737 MAXs which are still grounded by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) remain on tarmacs across the US.

“We have just had to deal with the realities we faced. For geopolitical reasons I am guessing we have been unable to make deliveries that we would like to make to our Chinese customers” David Calhoun the current CEO and President of Boeing told CNBC on December 13 2022 as the manufacturer and United Airlines announced a huge order for 200 aircraft. Calhoun reiterated that the company wants to deliver the airplanes but due to the huge demand for planes across the globe as the duopoly’s members struggle to build aircraft within the deadlines written in contracts with customers Boeing has had “to take advantage of that market”.

“We still have airplanes on the tarmac that they can take” Calhoun concluded.

“This year provides a dramatic opportunity to advance U.S.-China relations” said Ron Woodard President of Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) in April 1998 a few months before his retirement. While then-China President Jiang Zemin’s visit to the US in 1997 was deemed “highly successful” by the executive he hoped that Bill Clinton’s endeavor to China a few months later would become an opportunity “to further strengthen commerce and trade ties between our two countries”.

Still despite the complicated nature of the two countries’ relations Boeing managed to dominate Airbus in China and by 2002 it held a 70% market share versus the European aircraft maker’s 20%. The US-based manufacturer has worked long and hard to gain this share teaming up with local officials to ”develop the country’s aviation infrastructure” between 1972 and 2002.

“In the mid-’80s for example the Civil Aviation Institute in Tianjin and Boeing created training programs for maintenance technicians. In order to facilitate repairs Boeing helped develop the Beijing Capital Airport Spares Center. And Boeing the CAAC and the Aviation Industries of China joined forces to begin intensive training of pilots technicians and support staff” read Boeing Frontiers from December 2022 a magazine dedicated to current and former employees of the OEM. The manufacturer invested a further $300 million to help China “develop and expand its air transportation system” between 1990 and 2001.

The same year Boeing headhunted David Wang an executive from General Electric (GE) to lead its China efforts. Based in Beijing China Wang became President of Boeing China holding that role until 2011. In 2002 as well as throughout the first decade of the 21st century the company’s executives continuously reiterated that relationships mattered most.

”There’s an old Chinese saying that [goes] ‘When you drink from the well never forget who helped you dig the well.’ We helped the Chinese aviation industry dig the well and our Chinese friends will continue to remember” said Larry Dickenson the then-Senior Vice President of Sales at BCA in December 2002.

At some point in time the well began to dry up. By 2005 the Chicago Tribune indicated that Boeing controlled two-thirds of the market. However Airbus began taking back control of the market even more aggressively and the European manufacturer’s new aircraft deliveries “rocketed from 18 percent in 1993 to 67 percent last year according to Back Aviation Solutions” noted a Seattle Times report from 2005. Both manufacturers knew that China was the market (with an emphasis on the) and that they would have to give everything to conquer it.

Boeing however became complacent according to C.C. Tien who was quoted in the same Seattle Times article as saying that it was important for the OEM to show interest in Chinese headlines and daily developments. “Those are subtle things. You don’t see the direct payback for a long time” said Tien who left Boeing and at the time was consulting COMAC on its ARJ21 program.

Wang who at that point had been working as the US planemaker’s China President for three years noted that US and Chinese relations needed to become stronger as Boeing and China’s “friendship and cooperation will suffer if those relationships are not strong”.

Much like with the previous chipmaking example politics has helped Airbus to access the market. Wang indicated that the realities of traveling between China and the US for the former’s nationals “seriously affected our competitiveness” European politicians were not as pressing on various issues within China. In 1993 while Bill Clinton was yet to meet Zemin following the events in Tiananmen Square in 1989 when a month-long protest resulted in the deaths of hundreds if not thousands of people the German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was already in China making deals with the local government including an order for six Airbus A340 aircraft in November 1993 according to the Chicago Tribune. Politics has continued to play a part in how the two manufacturers play their game in China as the duopoly is intertwined with geopolitical developments whether they like it or not.

The US government has no official stake in Boeing. Airbus a publicly traded company has institutional shareholders from the governments of France Germany and Spain who collectively own a 25.9% stake in the company.

Drifting apart with the A350 and 787

Airbus and Boeing approached the new millennia quite differently in terms of product strategy. The European OEM moved its chips towards big hubs that would connect millions of people between major urban centers resulting in the Airbus A380 while the US planemaker came in with a leaner approach in the form of the 787 Dreamliner.

Sure Airbus managed to sell five A380s to China Southern Airlines but the double-decker jet could never catch up to the Boeing 787 in terms of sales in the country or globally for that matter. The Europeans recognized the gap in their product offering including the lackluster performance of the A340 and introduced the A350. Their strategic partner to develop this was China. Boeing meanwhile turned to Japan to help them develop the 787 even if it tried its best to save face with the Chinese.

In June 2005 just as Airbus was about to launch the A350 the direct competitor to the Dreamliner Boeing issued a press release titled “Boeing 787 Highlights $600 Million in Contracts with Chinese Suppliers”. It highlighted various parts that were built by local companies from the composite rudder or the wing-to-body fairing panels of the 787 and 737’s forward-entry doors to interior panels for the 777’s control cabin among others.

“China’s aviation industry is providing outstanding technological capabilities and resources that help us meet quality cost and delivery imperatives in our programs – particularly on the new 787. China has been a reliable partner to Boeing for many years and we are honored that they are part of our future with the 787 airplane” said Carolyn Corvi BCA Vice President and General Manager of Airplane Production at the time.

Still Japan became one of the most important industrial partners for the Dreamliner while Airbus turned to China to help them with the A350. In 2009 Laurence Barron who headed Airbus China said that if local suppliers were willing to offer competitive prices the manufacturer would be willing to allocate more than 5% of the airframe work to China. At the time the European OEM already signed deals with local companies to produce rudders and maintenance doors and was looking to negotiate for more according to Barron’s statement at the time.

There is perhaps no better indication of the warm relationship Airbus has enjoyed with China than the fact that the Tianjin FAL which primarily dealt with assembling the A320 family aircraft has also become a Completion & Delivery Centre (C&DC) for the A330 and A350. The lines to finalize the assembly of the A330 opened in 2017 while the center delivered its first A350 in July 2021.

The C&DC’s employees install cabins paint aircraft conduct production flight tests and perform customer flight acceptance flights that lead to a jet’s delivery to the customer. Boeing meanwhile has had a facility akin to Airbus’ C&DC – also called a Completion and Delivery Center – located in Zhoushan China. At the center 737 MAX interiors are installed as well as liveries are painted prior to deliveries to Chinese carriers. As mentioned previously the CAAC has still not ungrounded the 737 MAX leaving the center without a purpose for now. While the Chinese aviation authority held a meeting with Boeing in September 2022 “to carry out a comprehensive evaluation of the aircraft type-based training standards for the improved 737 planes” the CAAC said in its announcement there have not been any recent developments regarding the plane’s ungrounding.

Germany’s Scholz visited Xi in Beijing in November 2022 noting in his op-ed for Politico that “China remains an important business and trading partner for Germany and Europe” Biden met Xi in Indonesia prior to the G20s get-together the same month.

“China and the United States need to have a sense of responsibility for history for the world and for the people explore the right way to get along with each other in the new era put the relationship on the right course and bring it back to the track of healthy and stable growth to the benefit of the two countries and the world as a whole” read a statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China released shortly after the meeting ended.

THERE IS A NEW concept in zoning invented this year by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. In promulgated guidelines the concept has been dubbed “minimum multi-family unit capacity.” I refer to the concept as “zoning capacity.”

If you live in a community served by the MBTA the concept may soon animate discussions at your town or city hall or in local on-line forums or between neighbors about how much multi-family housing the community should allow.

In Lincoln the zoning capacity number of 635 will reverberate through civic deliberations. In Newton where I live we’ll study the figure 8330. In Acton 1383; in Medford 6443. The lowest number is in Plympton (53) the highest in Cambridge (13477).

What do these numbers mean?

In 2021 the state adopted the MBTA Communities zoning law requiring cities and towns served by the MBTA (outside of Boston) to zone a district “of reasonable size” for multi-family housing near MBTA stations where practical. The law was needed because eastern Massachusetts has a housing shortage and traffic problems and cities and towns have been over-restricting home development for decades. The solution under the law is transit-oriented development.

Notably though there was no pre-existing standard for reasonable size of zoning districts some of which are smaller than an acre. The new state law delegated authority to the executive branch – the Department of Housing and Community Development — to define reasonable size. And in defining it the agency invented the concept of zoning capacity.

In August the department issued guidelines defining minimum compliant district size in terms of two parameters A) land area and B) zoning capacity. Land area is straightforward measured in acres. Zoning capacity is more complicated.

Understanding zoning capacity

If you draw a zoning district for multi-family housing (defined as buildings with three or more dwelling units) on a municipal zoning map you can add up how many housing units in multi-family buildings could theoretically and maximally be built on every existing parcel in the district based on what the zoning allows regardless of what exists on each parcel or what the market might favor for each parcel. This count yields the zoning capacity of the district for multi-family housing.

To illustrate the concept let’s consider a single land parcel a one-acre property where the zoning allows for six dwelling units to be built. (The zoning might specify for example that multi-family buildings containing no more than six units are allowed on parcels that are one acre or larger.) The zoning capacity of the parcel at hand is six units.

Now imagine that the parcel is already built with four units. The zoning capacity is still six units. The four units may be new; their redevelopment unlikely. The zoning capacity is still six units. The four units might be decaying ready for teardown and redevelopment. The zoning capacity is still six units. The four units might be arranged on part of the parcel so there is room for two more units without tearing down the original four. The zoning capacity is still six units.

Now imagine that parcel is already built with eight units even though the zoning only allows for six units. The eight units are “non-conforming” with zoning. (Many buildings in Greater Boston are non-conforming with zoning.) The zoning capacity of the parcel is still six units.

Now imagine that parcel is built with a pharmacy and no homes but the zoning would allow for six dwelling units. The zoning capacity is still six units.

The zoning capacity for a whole district is calculated by adding up the zoning capacities of each existing land parcel within the district. Zoning capacity is not a home production goal. Zoning capacity is not a count of existing homes nor a projection of the number of homes that might be built under the zoning. Zoning capacity is a legal envelope of allowed buildings; an estimated count of technically allowed dwelling units.

The state has assigned a minimum multi-unit capacity number to each MBTA community; each municipality is required to have a zoning district (or districts) that contains the requisite zoning capacity for multi-family housing. The chart of required minimum zoning capacities for each municipality can be downloaded here: https://www.mass.gov/doc/mbta-communities-community-category-designations-and-capacity-calculations/download

How can cities and towns achieve compliance with their zoning capacity targets?

Under the framework of this law municipalities are responsible for their own zoning. Either their zoning is already in compliance with the MBTA Communities zoning law (by meeting the minimum land area minimum multi-family unit capacity and other requirements) or the municipality is now required to revise their local zoning requirements to come into compliance with state law. Since the state in November released the tools for measuring zoning capacity we do not know yet which if any cities and towns served by the MBTA already have zoning in place that meets the assigned minimum zoning capacities.

The law gives municipalities significant flexibility in drawing the districts and establishing the allowed densities (units per acre units per building etc.) and dimensional requirements (setbacks heights etc.) to meet the minimum capacity standards. Municipal planners are now beginning to test different zoning scenarios.

Municipalities seeking to limit construction of multi-family housing might draw the districts to cover areas that are already densely developed with housing so that redevelopment could not yield that many net new units. If the municipality draws the zoning densities close to — or even less than — existing densities then probably the municipality will not see a lot of building in the new zoning envelope. In this way the requirements indirectly credit municipalities that already have multi-family housing in qualifying locations although the guidelines also assign higher zoning capacity targets to the municipalities that already contain the most housing.

On the other hand changing the zoning where people already live is politically hard to do. We might therefore see this tool used more often in areas of underperforming asphalt where strip malls and office parks are languishing. In districts that now have no housing the zoning capacity number will equal the net potential buildout number.

All of the minimum capacities assigned to each municipality add up to 283463 dwelling units. Actual buildout of net new units will necessarily come in lower as at least some districts will be drawn over properties that contain some housing. Calculating “net new units allowed” would involve subtracting existing units from total zoning capacity of qualifying districts. The market is unlikely to build out to the full potential in the short term especially where there are already existing buildings on most properties.

There will likely be a lot of variability across communities in the ratio of newly built dwelling units compared to the minimum zoning capacities. In general the flexibility of the law differences in local housing markets the assignment of unique minimum multi-family unit capacities numbers and other factors will account for variable outcomes from place to place.

Why did each community get a unique capacity target?

The Department of Housing and Community Development concluded in its guidelines that reasonable size is a “relative rather than an absolute determination.” A district that is reasonable in one city or town may not be reasonable in another city or town the guidelines explain.

Per the guidelines municipalities that have rapid transit stations (Red Green Orange Silver Blue Lines) should have more responsibility to welcome new homes than communities that only have commuter rail stations. Communities that contain commuter rail stations should generally have to allow more housing than communities that are adjacent to municipalities that contain stations.

The Department of Housing and Community Development also determined that the zoning capacity requirements should scale with the number of existing homes in a municipality. The more homes in a municipality the greater the required zoning capacity. This relation of zoning capacity to current housing stock should generally even out the rate of growth across municipalities.

The MBTA Communities zoning law applies to 175 municipalities. This means that implementation will involve the engagement of thousands of people to analyze zoning test different scenarios debate alternatives write new zoning provisions run public hearings conduct public education and hold votes. Zoning capacity numbers will animate the whole effort – to gain abundant housing and great neighborhoods.

But more drugs and treatment options continue to be explored and in 2022 there were some exciting advancements in these areas for dermatologists treating psoriasis starting with four important FDA approvals.

Perhaps most importantly deucravacitinib (Sotyktu; Bristol Myers Squibb) an oral allosteric TYK2 inhibitor became the first oral therapy approval in more than a decade after Phase 3 POETYK PSO-1 and POETYK PSO-2 clinical trials proved successful.

“Sotyktu has the potential to become the new standard of care oral treatment for people with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis given its profile in helping patients achieve clearer skin as demonstrated in the POETYK PSO clinical program” said April Armstrong MD MPH associate dean and professor of Dermatology at the University of Southern California.

The FDA also approved tapinarof (VTAMA; Dermavant) cream 1% a once-daily steroid-free topical treatment for plaque psoriasis in adults regardless of disease severity becoming the first FDA-approved steroid-free topical medication.

A third FDA approval came for roflumilast cream (ZORYVE; Arcutis Biotherapeutics) 0.3% a topical PDE4 inhibitor of plaque psoriasis including intertriginous areas in patients 12 years of age and older which clears plaques and reduces itch rapidly in all affected areas of the body including intertriginous areas.

The fourth major FDA approval was for Boehringer Ingelheim’s spesolimab (SPEVIG) the first major treatment of generalized pustular psoriasis (GPP) flares in adult patients.

“GPP can have an enormous impact on patient's physical and emotional wellbeing” said Thomas Seck MD senior vice president of medicine and regulatory affairs for Boehringer Ingelheim. “With the FDA approval of this new treatment people living with GPP now have hope in knowing that there is an option to help treat their flares.”

Suzanne Friedler MD FAAD a dermatologist at Advanced Dermatology PC in New York noted the new classes of tropical treatments are something that has excited many dermatologists in 2022.

“Tapinarof and roflumilast are obviously the new topical treatments and there are the new JAK inhibitors that are also very exciting—these are novel mechanisms of action and what’s great about these new medications is that they also prolong remission” she said. “You have a once-a-day treatment that patients use and when patients clear they stay clear for quite a long period of time which we call a remittive effect.”

Previously the only other treatment that had similar remittive effect for psoriasis was tazarotene which was often irritating to the skin which is not true for these new tropical treatments.

Research continues of course and there are many things in the pipeline that dermatologists hope will be game changers in 2023 and beyond.

Friedler noted there are new biologics coming out new JAK inhibitors and other oral therapies and she expects Deucravacitinib to become even more prominent in the year ahead.

“The exciting thing about deucravacitinib is that it doesn’t have the black box warnings that are on many new JAKs because it works through one of the receptors so is more JAK adjacent and doesn’t give you the same concerns” she said. “It’s a safer treatment therefore and better than previous oral treatments.”

She explained that having an oral option is welcomed by dermatologists because a lot of the best treatments had been injectables.

“Tolerability is important; with steroids you have to worry about atrophy to the skin but with these newer medications that’s no longer a worry” Friedler said.

Fred Pescatore MD notes there are also some holistic approaches that gained prominence this year. For instance Pycnogenol a standardized natural plant extract from French maritime pine tree bark is a natural supplement that researchers have found improves symptoms of psoriasis.

“It’s been shown to significantly improve the painful and visible symptoms of psoriasis including redness flaking thickness and total surface area of affected skin patches” he said. “After just 12 weeks of supplementation with Pycnogenol the area of skin affected by psoriasis in all body regions was decreased by 20% compared to just 8% with standard management.”

It’s important for dermatologists to keep up on the latest drugs and treatments and share their findings with patients who may not be as up to date on what’s available to help.

Clients with psoriasis can be challenging to treat however providing genuine care education and resources for these people not only helps change their experience with this chronic condition but creates a sense of trust that builds a loyal practice and clientele.

As COVID cases increase across China Paxlovid – an oral antiviral drug manufactured by Pfizer specifically to treat COVID – has been sold for exorbitant prices on the black market even as people began to question the efficacy of the “Western medicine.” An article initially posted online and reprinted on major news sites stated that a ""Pfizer executive"" and ""Paxlovid promoter"" named Chan died recently of COVID in his 40s casting doubt on how well Paxlovid treated the disease.

Asia Fact Check Lab found the information to be false. Chan never worked for Pfizer and his condition does not disprove Paxlovid’s established efficacy in treating COVID.

In Depth

As COVID cases sprouted across China in December 2022 Paxlovid became a hot commodity. Beijing’s municipal government said it would begin supplying Paxlovid to community hospitals and include the drug in medical insurance. However given the short supply and intransparent distribution system many sick residents in need have been unable to get a prescription.

Many voices on Weibo question Paxlovid’s usefulness claiming that the drug's approval process is haphazard and its efficacy unknown. Others allege that including Paxlovid in health insurance plans is a conspiracy by Western capitalists to ""empty the treasury.""

Did a Pfizer executive die from COVID?

On Dec. 26 a short news article headlined ""Pfizer executive in his 40s passes away from COVID"" spread rapidly across the internet and was soon republished by various news outlets. The article’s text reads ""Ho Kit Chan (陈可杰) head of Pfizer's marketing department in Shanghai passed away at Ruijin Hospital in Shanghai due to a COVID infection. Before his death he spared no effort to promote Pfizer's COVID treatments."" The text was accompanied by a portrait of Chan and a screenshot of an internal email stating that ""Ho Kit Chan head of clinical operations in China"" had died from an illness. The news has since been used as evidence that Paxlovid is ineffective.

Various news websites reprinted misinformation that a ""Pfizer executive died from COVID.” (Photo/Screenshot of a Baidu search)

AFCL was able to confirm that Chan died due to complications arising from COVID on Dec. 22. But the pharmaceutical company executive had never worked for Pfizer nor in any way promoted the company’s COVID treatments. Public records verify that Chan did work at several multinational drug companies during his career eventually serving as head of clinical operations at the Bristol Myers Squibb’s China branch a well-known pharmaceutical company referenced in the screenshot from the internal email featured in the original article which started the rumor.

Screenshot of a post claiming that a ""Pfizer executive passed away from COVID.""

Is there any evidence that Paxlovid is ineffective at treating COVID?

The news about Chan was removed by most websites after being dispelled by pharmaceutical industry sources and major news outlets. However screenshots from the articles continue to circulate online via social media accounts with millions of followers. For example two posts declare that ""Pfizer’s drugs can’t save Pfizer’s executives"" and ""Could a million people have died in the U.S. if the drug [Paxlovid] worked?""

Although Chan’s health and medical history are unknown his case cannot be used as evidence that Paxlovid is ineffective at treating COVID.

In fact several studies have shown that Paxlovid is an effective treatment. In December 2021 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorized emergency use of Paxlovid to reduce the risk of serious illness and death in patients over 12 at high risk of catching COVID. China approved domestic marketing of the drug in February. In April the World Health Organization strongly recommended that COVID patients at high risk of serious illness use Paxlovid based on its own studies that showed use of the drug can reduce the hospitalization risk from COVID by up to 85%. A study by researchers from the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the University of Hong Kong that analyzed data from more than 50000 COVID patients found that Paxlovid reduced the risk of death by 90%.

AFCL reminds readers that Paxlovid is a prescription drug that should be used as prescribed by a physician.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiuwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wcm5ld3N3aXJlLmNvbS9uZXdzLXJlbGVhc2VzL3Byb3B1bHNpb24tb2YtcGFuY3JlYXRpYy1jYW5jZXItcGlwZWxpbmUtYXMtbm92ZWwtYW5kLWV4dGVuc2l2ZS0xNzAtdGhlcmFwaWVzLWxpa2VseS10by1lbnRlci1pbi10aGUtdHJlYXRtZW50LWRvbWFpbi0tZGVsdmVpbnNpZ2h0LTMwMTcxMTc0My5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Propulsion of Pancreatic Cancer Pipeline as Novel and Extensive 170+ Therapies Likely to Enter in the Treatment ...,"The prevalence of pancreatic cancer has been rising since the past few years which prompts the growing demand for treatment options.

Pancreatic Cancer Overview

Pancreatic cancer develops in the pancreas tissues an abdomen organ located behind the stomach's bottom portion. The pancreas secretes hormones that help control blood sugar and enzymes that aid digestion. Pancreatic cancer is a condition in which malignant (cancer) cells develop in pancreatic tissues. The pancreas can develop tumors in various ways including malignant and noncancerous tumors. However the precise causes of pancreatic cancer are unknown. Individuals diagnosed with pancreatic cancer before the tumor develops or spreads have an average life expectancy of pancreatic cancer of 3 to 3.5 years.

Pancreatic cancer symptoms may include jaundice dark urine weight loss loss of appetite fatigue and others. A pancreatic cancer diagnosis is difficult because symptoms are frequently confused with those of other disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. The extent of the cancer determines the treatment of pancreatic cancer options. Pancreatic cancer treatment options may include surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy targeted therapy or a combination of these.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection go to Ken Fisher’s Top 5 Growth Stock Picks.

The founder of Fisher Asset Management Ken Fisher believes that the market circumstances in 2023 will be similar to those in 1967. In an article posted in New York Post Mr. Fisher highlighted that in 1966 inflation was also at a high level along with concerns related to a possible recession. Furthermore the US Federal Reserve was increasing the benchmark interest rates to combat the raging inflation while the war in Vietnam was escalating. In 1966 the S&P 500 Index experienced a decline of 22%. Similar to the market conditions in 2022 the downfall in 1966 started in January and the market bottomed out in October. The market staged a comeback in the fourth quarter of 1966 and recorded a gain of 6% for the three-month period followed by a YoY rise of 24% in 1967. The comeback is again similar to the 7.2% gain experienced by the S&P 500 Index since October 1 this year.

In one of his talks with Fox Business Mr. Fisher said that the YoY growth in loans had touched 11.5% indicating that the US economy is unlikely to enter a recession now. However Mr. Fisher underscored the significance of stock compound growth in bearish markets and emphasized how long-term investment in portfolios might contribute to high returns for investors during an economic downturn. Some of the popular companies included in Ken Fisher’s Q3 portfolio include Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL).

Ken Fisher’s Top 15 Growth Stock Picks

15. Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 142

Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $510429000

Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 0.38%

Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is a San Francisco California-based company that provides ride-hailing and food delivery services.

The company holds a 72% share in the US ride-hailing industry. Eric Sheridan at Goldman Sachs believes that in the current macroeconomic situation Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is more focused on generating better bottom-line numbers and would be more controlled in making investments. The analyst added that themes like ordering food online for delivery and pickup have become more normalized after the COVID-19 pandemic and Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is a key player that can leverage this theme to support its growth momentum.

Story continues

RiverPark Funds shared its outlook on Uber Technologies Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:

“Uber was our top contributor for the quarter on better-than-expected 2Q results and 3Q EBITDA guidance that was well ahead of Street estimates. The company reported 33% Gross Bookings growth from both the continued recovery of Mobility Gross Bookings up 55% year over year and the continuation of Delivery Gross Bookings growth up 7% year over year. Overall revenue grew 105% year over year to $8 billion generating $364 million of adjusted EBITDA up $873 million year over year. Management guided to 25%-30% gross bookings growth and adjusted EBITDA of $440-$470 million for 3Q. Significantly FCF was positive at $382 million up $780 million year over year and remains on track to be positive for the year allowing the company to self-fund future growth. UBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing with greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover after a history of losses the company is now solidly profitable with the expectation of substantial margin expansion and free cash flow generation to come. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its more than 120 million users (by comparison Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services such as grocery delivery truck brokerage (the company had $1.8 billion in Freight revenue for 2Q22) and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $10 billion of cash and investments against $9 billion of debt the company today has an enterprise value of $57 billion indicating that UBER trades at only 1.5x next year’s estimated revenue.”

14. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74

Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $672960000

Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 0.5%

Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a San Jose California-based company that designs develops and manufactures a wide variety of semiconductor and infrastructure software solutions.

On December 14 Ross Seymore at Deutsche Bank increased the target price for Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock from $575 to $590 and reiterated a Buy rating. The analyst highlighted that investors would be looking for a bottom in terms of fundamentals and share price in the semiconductor sector in 2023. Experts believe Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) delivered stellar Q4 2022 results that outperformed consensus estimates. The company also provided stronger-than-expected guidance for 2023. Broadcom Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) end markets performed well overall and its strong cash flows enabled a sizable 12% increase in dividends. The stock offers a dividend yield of 3.33% as of December 30.

ClearBridge Investments discussed its stance on Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q4 2021 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:

“However ClearBridge portfolio companies are responding by supporting their workforces and showing resilience in adapting and thriving. Semiconductor companies ClearBridge owns and engages with have been successful in advancing vaccinations in their global supply chains. In Malaysia for example Broadcom has taken part in PIKAS a public-private partnership vaccination program focusing on the workforce in critical manufacturing sectors. By the summer of 2021 Broadcom was able to get over 90% of workers in its Penang factory at least one dose of vaccine and roughly 73% fully vaccinated. Companies in the program also pay the administration cost for vaccinations including cases where the employee is no longer employed by the company before full immunization of the employee.”

13. Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 63

Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $830364000

Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 0.62%

Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) is a Fremont California-based provider of equipment required for wafer fabrication in the semiconductor industry founded in 1980.

On December 12 Sidney Ho at Deutsche Bank upgraded Lam Research Corporation’s (NASDAQ:LRCX) stock from a Hold to a Buy rating and also increased the target price by 30% from $400 to $520. The analyst highlighted that amongst the large-cap semiconductor equipment manufacturer Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) has the greatest memory exposure. The stock suffered in 2022 due to spending cuts by memory suppliers and export restrictions in China. However the analyst anticipates a rebound in fortunes in 2024 as the spending on the memory industry is unsustainably low for 2023.

Here’s what Vulcan Value Partners said about Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ:LRCX) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:

“Lam Research Corp. designs and manufactures equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors. Recent supply chain issues have negatively impacted the industry and has resulted in chip shortages. The industry is performing well exceeding our expectations and Lam Research’s fundamentals remain strong. The long-term secular drivers of demand and growth in the industry continue to be very powerful. Lam Research is experiencing increasing returns on capital higher margins and more stable results.”

12. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89

Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $ 1228825000

Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 0.94%

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a Santa Clara California-based company known for manufacturing leading processors graphic processing units (GPUs) and other applications tools and software.

Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) stock was selected as the ‘Top pick’ in the semiconductor space by Joseph Moore at Morgan Stanley on December 15. The analyst has assigned Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) a Buy rating along with a target price of $77. Experts anticipate Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) to experience growth and gain market share in the cloud computing and server business in the coming quarters.

Here’s what L1 Capital International said about Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:

“The share price of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was weak during the quarter and weakened further in early October when the pre-announced revenue was significantly below prior guidance reflecting an acute slowdown in the PC market. Data centre related revenue grew strongly albeit below our expectations while gaming and embedded revenue was in line with our base case. Geopolitical risks have increased for the semiconductor sector with the U.S. Government announcing restrictions on the sale of certain technologies to China. Despite near term headwinds AMD is well positioned for the medium term with a technology lead over Intel in servers for data centres and rapidly gaining share in the PC/notebook sectors. Its gaming and embedded applications continue to grow strongly. AMD is a very capital light business with manufacturing outsourced. After expending nearly $5b on research and development AMD generates around $5b of free cashflow. With a net cash balance sheet we expect management will accelerate buyback activity at a share price well below fair value. The share price of our more cyclical businesses in particularly the building products companies which have exposure to the U.S. residential repair and renovation and infrastructure sectors were broadly flat for the quarter. Rapidly escalating mortgage rates and rapidly reducing affordability will have a pronounced negative effect on near term new residential construction activity. We believe these cyclical pressures are well understood and are more than reflected in current share prices. Overall we strongly believe share prices are overly reflecting near-term challenges and our portfolio of companies are now meaningfully undervalued.”

11. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 93

Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $1415171000

Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.06%

Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a San Jose California-based software company known for providing creative document and marketing management solutions.

On December 16 J. Parker Lane at Stifel increased the price target on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) from $375 to $400 and kept a Buy rating on the stock. Lane shared that the company finished FY22 on a high as it reported a “record net new Digital Media quarter.” Furthermore the management maintained the bullish guidance outlined during the analyst day in October. The analyst thinks the investors’ focus is likely to remain on the company's $20 billion acquisition of Figma announced in September 2022 and its impact on the product roadmap for Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE).

Here’s what Aristotle Capital Management LLC said about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:

“Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) the content creation and publishing software provider was the largest detractor for the quarter. So far in 2022 Adobe has achieved record revenues with strength in all its businesses as the acceleration toward digital has continued to drive content creation across industries. During the quarter however the company’s shares declined after announcing its plans to acquire Figma a web‐first collaborative interface design platform for $20 billion. What at first glance may seem like a steep price Figma’s web‐based multi‐player platform could accelerate the delivery of Adobe’s Creative Cloud technologies on the web increasing Adobe’s reach and total addressable market. Management expects the deal to close in 2023 and the transaction to be accretive by the end of the third year of integration. As is the case with any significant acquisition we will take our time to understand this deal’s rationale and follow management’s ability to take Figma to “new heights.” This has been the case with previous acquisitions including Marketo and Magento (although each at a much smaller purchase price). In general we admire management teams that are able to recognize the evolving needs of their clients and are unafraid of “competing with themselves” by developing new offerings. We will continue to study this acquisition and better understand the desire of content creators to collaborate over the web.”

10. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 89

Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $ 1469685000

Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.1%

NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a Santa Clara-California-based company founded in 1993 that invented the graphic processing unit (GPU). The company is a key player in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).

Rajvindra Gill at Needham raised the target price for NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) by 15% from $200 to $230 and maintained a Buy rating on the stock on December 19. The analyst highlighted NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock as his top pick for 2023 and added it to the Conviction list for the investment firm. Gill also added that the data center segment could face volatility in 2023 but NVIDIA Corporation’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) customers are shifting towards the H100 architecture.

Here’s what Baron Funds said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:

“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming data centers and autonomous machines along with the size of these markets we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below. During the third quarter we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming data centers and autonomous machines along with the size of these markets would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years and Moore’s Law slowing down there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture with parallel computing at scale answers that need.”

9. PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126

Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $1520711000

Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.13%

PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a San Jose California-based operator of digital wallets and money management tools through its online payment system that operates in over 200 countries and supports 25 currencies.

Ramsey El-Assal at Barclays increased the target price for PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) from $100 to $108 and reiterated an Overweight rating on December 12. Experts believe that PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) could experience better top-line and bottom-line margins due to more partnerships and less investment in venture capital. The fintech companies are now expected to generate higher returns due to rising benchmark interest rates. This is expected to make the companies focus on their core competencies and not compete against their industry peers at all levels.

Here’s what Wedgewood Partners said about PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:

“PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) contributed positively to performance as the Company reported accelerating revenue growth and more concrete measures to drive long-term profitability. Revenue growth accelerated throughout the quarter as the Company is taking share in e-commerce while lapping the headwinds of the eBay rolling off. While eBay’s revenues represented higher-margin revenues the Company should be able to drive better transaction margins as total payment volume growth reaccelerates. Part and parcel of this growth comes from PayPal’s investments to drive higher penetration into its 429 million active accounts. PayPal’s active accounts have grown by +50% since the onset of the pandemic so it makes sense for management to focus on driving higher transactions per account thus better to monetize this historical windfall of users. The Company also authorized a $15 billion share repurchase program which represents over 10% of shares outstanding. This is a good use of capital relative to the Company’s historically depressed multiples.”

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 115

Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $1574217000

Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.18%

Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a Los Gatos California-based digital streaming service provider with a presence in 190 countries and a subscriber count of 223.09 million as of 2022.

Jason Helfstein at Oppenheimer gave Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) stock a target price of $365 along with an Outperform rating on December 20. The analyst believes that the stock price performance of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be driven by the increasing number of subscribers. The subscriber count can be gauged by the viewership numbers shared by the digital streaming company from time to time. The analyst is confident that Netflix Inc.’s (NASDAQ:NFLX) new ad-based streaming service will not miss ad revenue targets in the short term.

Here’s what Artisan Partners said about Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:

“Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Vertex Pharmaceuticals were two of our top contributors. Shares of Netflix got some relief after being under pressure in the first half of 2022. Media and entertainment stocks in general have been out of favor as investors grapple with the long-term economics of streaming services and slowing subscriber growth—what should be viewed as a normal feature of a maturing market. Our view is streaming is a scale and intellectual property business that will result in a few large winners and we believe Netflix will be among this group. We initiated our position in Netflix in Q1 after shares fell by more than half due to concerns about subscriber growth and increasing competition from streaming upstarts. The stock then suffered a second down leg in April after the company reported subscriber losses for the first time in its history. Then in July the company reported its second consecutive quarter of subscriber losses but the nearly 1 million subscribers lost were much lower than the 2 million that management had forecast and shares rallied on the news. For patient investors there is reason for optimism that subscriber growth will turn around. The company has plans to crack down on password sharing and is launching a lower cost advertising supported tier. Our investment case is focused on an undemanding valuation massive scale a continued shift in time and attention from linear TV to streaming and a financial condition which gives management the flexibility to operate unconstrained during a transition period for the business. We also believe Netflix can leverage its massive global scale of 200+ million subscribers into positive free cash flow though steady pricing increases and content spending controls.”

7. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 177

Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $1604616000

Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.2%

Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a Menlo Park California-based technology conglomerate that owns leading social media and instant messaging platforms like Facebook Instagram and WhatsApp.

Doug Anmuth at JPMorgan upgraded Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock from a Neutral to an Overweight rating and increased the price target on the stock from $115 to $150 on December 16. The analyst highlighted that the stock price of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) lost 65% of its value YTD due to the amendments in the privacy policies by Apple increased competition from TikTok and other similar issues. However the analyst anticipates the adverse impact of these developments to ease in the following year. Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has also shown signs of improved control over costs which is expected to give a boost to the company’s margins.

ClearBridge Investments discussed its outlook on Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:

“Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) one of two overweights among the mega cap stocks underperformed in the third quarter (-15.9%) and is the Strategy’s largest detractor year to date. Meta has also trailed mega cap advertising peer Alphabet which we don’t own as revenue growth has slowed due to tough comparables to a strong e-commerce environment in early 2021 negative impacts from Apple’s privacy changes and rising expenses. While we have trimmed our position close to 20% we remain invested as we do not think the stocks’ valuation at about 13x consensus 2023 earnings appropriately reflects its long-term earnings and free cash flow generation potential. Despite current revenue headwinds we believe Meta is well-positioned to navigate industrywide changes to advertising targeting and its transition to the Reels short-form video format will monetize in the coming years helping to re-accelerate revenue growth. We also welcome Meta’s implementation of cost-cutting measures which should help uncover the company’s high underlying profitability. Lastly we see Meta’s investments in augmented reality as a call option for long-duration investors.”

6. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 87

Fisher Asset Management’s Holdings: $ 1722650000

Percentage of Fisher Asset Management’s Portfolio: 1.29%

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is a Hsinchu Taiwan-based operator of semiconductor foundry.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is working on expanding its footprint in the European market by establishing a foundry in Dresden Germany. The company is in the process of establishing a foundry in the US state of Arizona that will begin commercial production in 2024. The famous electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has already placed an order with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) which will be produced at the company’s new facility.

RiverPark Funds discussed its stance on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its Q2 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:

“Taiwan Semiconductor detracted from performance despite a business performance that saw revenue accelerate to over +30% growth. The Company is one of the few fabs in the world that is capable of manufacturing leading-edge integrated circuits (IC). The Company’s leading-edge capacity is being absorbed by high-performance computing applications particularly by Apple which has become an integrated circuit powerhouse over the past decade. The Company’s aggressive investment in leading-edge equipment tight development with fabless IC designers and embrace of open development libraries should continue to foster a superior competitive position and attractive long-term growth.”

In addition to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) Ken Fisher also has a stake in Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as of Q3 2022.

The line introduced under the brand name Halo Top Desserts includes a light cake mix in single-serve cups and light baking mixes for fudge brownies and peanut butter chocolate chip cookies.

The microwavable light cake mix in single-serve cups is available in three varieties: chocolate strawberry and birthday cake and contains 170 calories.

According to the company all the baking mixes will be manufactured by General Mills Inc. They will be available at Walmart and Kroger locations beginning in early February with further national retail availability coming in the summer. The single-serve cake mixes have a suggested retail price of $2.89 and the boxed mixes have a suggested retail price of $4.99.

The recent addition of the baking mixes comes after the company announced a new formula for its ice cream in April 2022.

“Halo Top was founded on an idea to make a lower calorie ice cream that doesn’t sacrifice flavor and indulgence” said Peter Gargula brand manager at Halo Top. “We’ve been constantly innovating products to give consumers indulgence they can feel good about. We can’t wait to bring our loyal fans into the baking aisle in this trusted extension from cold to warm with Halo Top Desserts.”",,,,,,,,,

With supply chain and labor shortages plaguing the industry over the last few years numerous cruise ships set to debut in 2021 were finally launched within the last year.

Additionally many delayed and cancelled cruise itineraries finally took place in 2022 including my much-anticipated Israel cruise on Royal Caribbean’s Odyssey of the Seas.

I was also fortunate enough to sail on Carnival Cruise Line's newest ship Carnival Celebration during one of the ship’s inaugural voyages. This brand-new ship for Carnival Cruise Line is the second ship in the fleet’s new Excel-class.

Image

Along with Carnival Mardi Gras Carnival Celebration is a completely redesigned amplified cruise ship for the cruise line. Holding 40% more passengers than any other ship in Carnival’s fleet the new Excel-class exemplifies a more modern open and innovative approach to cruising.

Image

Carnival Celebration was unlike any Carnival ship I’ve sailed on before - the new ship was trendy sleek and stylish. The spaces onboard didn’t feel crowded or cramped.

Additionally the incredible entertainment numerous dining options and functional staterooms were all part of Carnival's revamped ship design; these design changes created a more upscale experience while still maintaining that ‘fun’ Carnival branding at its core.

Image

With so much excitement in 2022 I am already looking forward to what 2023 will bring to the cruising industry. You can anticipate ships that are bigger and better than anything built before!

Here are the exciting sailings I am looking forward to the most in the coming year.

Image

Carnival Jubilee is set to launch next year as the third cruise ship in Carnival Cruise Line’s wildly successfully Excel-class

Similarly built to Carnival Mardi Gras and Carnival Celebration the newest ship Carnival Jubilee will launch in 2023 for Carnival Cruise Line.

This brand-new Carnival cruise ship is named after the cruise line's original Carnival Jubilee which was retired and scrapped in 2017 after nearly 30 years of service.

The referenced media source is missing and needs to be re-embedded.

For years Carnival Cruise Line resisted cruise industry trends of building mega ships that rivaled floating vacation resorts. All of that changed with the debut of the Excel-class when the cruise line started building ships that were bigger and better than anything the cruise line had designed before.

Mardi Gras the first ship in the class introduced a ton of firsts for the cruise line including Emerli's Bistro 1396 Emeril Lagasse's first-ever restaurant at sea; Street Eats three open-air stalls that are meant to remind passengers of the food truck phenomenon; and redesigned staterooms that feature showers with glass doors. So long curtain!

Following the success of its sister ships Carnival Jubilee is a highly anticipated addition to Carnival’s growing fleet. For instance guests can expect to find Bolt the industry’s only rollercoaster at sea that first debuted on Carnival Mardi Gras and Carnival Celebration.

Image

Excel-class ships have designated zones - each with their own flair. For instance Carnival Mardi Gras has a French Quarter zone that is themed after New Orleans while Carnival Celebration has The Gateway which is a travel-inspired zone in the ship’s center.

Image

Guests can expect to find two zones that are specifically catered to Carnival Jubilee although these have yet to be released by the cruise line.

Sailing from Galveston Texas Carnival Jubilee will be the biggest Carnival ship to sail from Texas - holding around 5400 passengers. Excitement certainly surrounds expanded areas of Carnival favorites such as the two-story RedFrog Tiki Bar and maximized Guy’s Burger Joint.

Image

The inaugural sailing for Carnival Jubilee is slotted for late December 2023. Carnival Jubilee’s December debut is delayed from the initial scheduled launch date for October 2023 because of shipyard delays.

Sailings on Carnival Jubilee include Western Caribbean ports like Cozumel and Costa Maya.

Celebrity Ascent will launch in 2023 following the success of sister-ships Celebrity Edge and Celebrity Beyond

Following the heels of Celebrity Edge Celebrity Apex and Celebrity Beyond the cruise line plans to debut its fourth ship in the new Edge-class in 2023 - Celebrity Ascent.

Image

Similar to Celebrity Beyond which debuted in 2022 Celebrity Ascent will be larger than earlier Edge-class ships to accommodate expanded venues onboard. Standing one deck taller and 20 meters longer Celebrity Ascent will follow Beyond’s lead with an expanded Sunset Bar on the ship’s aft which was one of our favorite spots on Celebrity Beyond.

Image

The expanded deck space also creates more room for a larger Rooftop Garden Grand Plaza and suite-only Retreat area.

Having more space onboard also allows for more staterooms with Celebrity Ascent having 12% more staterooms than Celebrity Edge and Celebrity Apex.

Image

Celebrity Ascent will also feature two new cantilevered floating pools on its top deck along with the ever-so-popular Magic Carpet. This floating bright-orange venue off the side of the ship serves multiple purposes. By day the Magic Carpet is a tendering launch through Destination Gateway and transforms to a nightly bar on the top deck.

Image

Slotted to debut in December 2023 Celebrity Ascent will sail from Fort Lauderdale for Caribbean sailings. During the summer 2024 season she will sail from Europe to places like Italy France Spain Greece and Turkey!

In 2023 MSC plans to debut its first-ever luxury exploration ship Explora 1 which will offer destination-focused itineraries

While MSC has been building some of the cruise industry’s largest ships the cruise line also plans to enter into the luxury cruise liner industry next year. Rather than catering to the mass cruise market MSC is creating an entirely new cruising segment under the MSC brand.

Image

With Explora Journeys MSC hopes to offer destination-focused itineraries that allow guests to string together multiple sailings to create one extended journey onboard a luxury vessel.

Each itinerary is unique with no repeats on the ship’s schedule which also includes extended stays in some ports to create a slower-paced itinerary. Simply put there are no roundtrip sailings planned for Explora Journeys with MSC.

Image

The new cruising segment for MSC aims to attract not just people who prefer to take luxury cruises but also to tap into the luxury travel segment as a whole. Holding right around 1000 passengers Explora 1 is considered a larger luxury vessel for cruising standards.

Explora 1 was designed similarly to an upscale resort so you also won’t find big restaurants onboard the new luxury exploration ship; instead MSC wants to focus on creating intimate upscale venues.

Image

Explora 1 will debut first in Europe for the summer of 2023 before repositioning to North America in the winter; this new luxury cruise ship will be the first of six ships in the Explora Journeys ship class for MSC. The rest will be launched between 2024 and 2028.

Resilient Lady the third ship for Virgin Voyages will continue shaking up the cruise industry with its trendy and unique approach to cruising

Originally scheduled to launch in 2022 Resilient Lady will finally debut in 2023 after nearly a year of delays.

Image

Similar to Virgin Voyages’ other ships Scarlet Lady and Valiant Lady the start-up cruise line from Richard Branson has been designed to rethink traditional cruising. The new Resilient Lady will be seemingly identical to its sister-ships each holding around 2700 passengers.

Image

The adult-only cruise line has introduced many industry-firsts like a tattoo parlor and drag queen bingo. Like its sister ships Resilient Lady will ditch the main dining room concept to feature non-traditional dining venues and imaginative cuisine. You also won’t find any buffets onboard Resilient Lady - or any Virgin Voyages ship for that matter. Plus all of the restaurants are included in the cost of your base fare.

Image

Resilient Lady will continue to ditch dress codes and Broadway-style shows; instead you can enjoy interactive dance parties late-night dodgeball colorful karaoke and nightclubs.

Expanding its cruising footprint Resilient Lady will be the first Virgin Voyages ship to sail to the Land Down Under. With a scheduled launch in May 2023 the brand-new Resilient Lady will set sail in the Mediterranean’s Greek Isles before repositioning to Australia for the winter where it will cater more specifically to an Aussie market and sail to ports like Napier New Zealand; Hobart Australia; and Sydney Australia.

Norwegian Cruise Line plans to launch Norwegian Viva in 2023 which will have the most outdoor deck space of any new cruise ship

With a debut scheduled for August 2023 Norwegian Cruise Line plans to rollout the second ship of its highly-anticipated Prima-class Norwegian Viva. This brand-new ship will be nearly identical to sister ship Norwegian Prima which was launched in 2022.

Image

Significantly smaller than other ships in Norwegian Cruise Line’s fleet Norwegian Viva (and sister-ship Prima) hold approximately 3200 guests onboard (compare this to the largest cruise ship in the world Wonder of the Seas which can hold close to 7000 passengers).

Despite being the cruise line's newest class of ships they are not the largest. The largest ship in Norwegian's fleet by weight is Norwegian Encore while the largest by guest capacity is Norwegian Escape which can hold an impressive 4266 passengers at double capacity.

These smaller vessels in the Prima-class will allow the ships to dock in smaller ports which will undoubtedly lead to more unique itineraries.

Image

Just because Norwegian Viva is smaller than earlier ships built by the cruise line doesn’t mean it won’t have a slew of amenities activities and entertainment options. The industry’s first go-kart track will be bigger and better than ever on Norwegian Viva.

Image

Norwegian Cruise Line also claims that its brand-new ship will boast more outdoor deck space than any other new cruise launching; additionally similar to Norwegian Prima Norwegian Viva will have more pool deck space onboard compared to any other ship in Norwegian’s fleet.

Image

The new Norwegian Viva will first sail its inaugural season in the Mediterranean before repositioning to the Caribbean next winter and sail roundtrip from San Juan Puerto Rico.

MSC World Europa will debut in the final days of 2022 - and it’s almost as big as the world’s largest cruise ship

While MSC World Europa has technically already debuted it’s so close to 2023 that we will count it in our list of ships we are excited for in 2023. The newest ship for the European-based MSC cruise line just recently debuted and made a big splash in the cruising industry.

Image

If you watched the World Cup in Qatar you might have seen the MSC World Europa on the big screen! The newest cruise ship for MSC was featured as a hotel during the FIFA World Cup before cruising on December 20 for its inaugural sailing.

The massive MSC World Europa is the first cruise ship to be built in 13 years that competes with Royal Caribbean’s enormous Oasis-class of ships. With 6700 passengers onboard MSC World Europa is only 6% smaller than Royal Caribbean’s five Oasis-class ships.

Image

Similar to Royal Caribbean as well MSC followed suit by creating distinct neighborhoods onboard the massive World Europa. Guests can find an adults-only district entertainment promenade and a separate family-district with nearly 10 are kids facilities.

While some cruise lines -- like Virgin Voyages -- are doing away with traditional self-serve buffets MSC World Europa will feature three different buffets that each feature their own unique ambiances and offerings. The ship is obviously massive with 13 different dining venues 6 pools and 14 hot tubs.

Image

Sailing Dubai for its debut season MSC World Europa will visit the Persian Gulf before repositioning to the Mediterranean in the summer.

Royal Caribbean’s Serenade of the Seas will set sail on the cruise line’s first Ultimate World Cruise in 2023

If time and money were unlimited in my life (and perhaps I could bring my dogs) you could expect to find me on Royal Caribbean’s Ultimate World Cruise.

This incredible sailing will take place over 274 nights on Royal Caribbean’s Serenade of the Seas. Although this isn’t a brand-new ship by any means (she set sail in August 2003) this grand voyage is newly offered by Royal Caribbean International. The cruise line has never offered any type of extended cruise journey with a heavy focus on global destinations.

Image

During the Ultimate World Cruise guests onboard Serenade of the Seas can visit world wonders like the Great Wall of China Iguana Falls the Taj Mahal Machu Picchu. Other unique countries on the itinerary include India Bulgaria Romania Ukraine Antarctica and Morocco.

There are even over 40 ports of call that are rarely available on other itineraries or are brand new to Royal Caribbean!

Image

This unforgettable journey will set sail in December 2023 visiting 60+ different countries and 11 world wonders. Technically this world cruise starts and ends in Miami Florida and takes place throughout most of 2024.

Guests can also opt to take certain segments of the itinerary if the entire 274-nights aren’t feasible each of which lasts a minimum of 60 nights and visits at least 36 different destinations.

The Ultimate World Cruise will cost you a pretty penny though. The entire voyage starts at $59k per person for an inside cabin while one of the individual four segments cost around $12k-$16 per person.

However you do get certain perks that make the fare a bit more inclusive like a Deluxe Beverage Package wash and fold laundry service included gratuities and Voom internet.

PRESS RELEASE

Etihad Cargo has achieved 80.5 per cent OTP for freighter departures and 84.1 per cent OTP for freighter arrivals ahead of its 80 per cent target

The carrier surpassed its 85 per cent DAP target achieving 86.6 per cent

PharmaLife performance continued to outpace previous years driven by the launch of new product features a commitment to world-class standards and the establishment of Pharma Corridor 2.0

6 per cent more horses were moved via the carrier’s SkyStables product compared to the previous year

The carrier received 25 awards in 2022 in recognition of its operational performance and contribution to pharmaceutical transportation innovation sustainability and CSR within the air cargo sector

Abu Dhabi United Arab Emirates – Etihad Cargo the cargo and logistics arm of Etihad Aviation Group exceeded its operational performance targets in 2022. The carrier achieved 80.5 per cent on-time-performance (OTP) for freighter departures and 84.1 per cent OTP for freighter arrivals ahead of its 80 per cent target.

The carrier has also maintained a delivered-as-promised (DAP) rate of 86.6 per cent a 2.6 per cent improvement compared to the previous year and over its target of 85 per cent.

Martin Drew Senior Vice President – Global Sales & Cargo at Etihad Aviation Group said “Having achieved record revenue results in the first half of 2022 the focus for Etihad Cargo was building on this momentum to ensure the carrier continued to meet customers’ capacity demands with agility. Exceeding OTP and DAP targets which measure the carrier’s ability to deliver cargo at the agreed time and the punctuality of its freighter fleet against schedule demonstrates Etihad Cargo’s strong commitment to reliability building trust and being the air cargo partner of choice.”

2022 saw Etihad Cargo retire the last of its aircraft reconfigured to carry cargo-in-cabin. While a surge in passenger demand impacted capacity Etihad Cargo maintained a strong belly-to-freighter load factor recording a 58 per cent belly and 42 per cent freighter load mix at the end of 2022. The carrier has also achieved a load factor of 91 per cent and a freighter utilisation rate of 14.3 hours.

Etihad Cargo has also achieved growth across a number of its eight-strong premium products. The carrier’s award-winning PharmaLife product which is dedicated to the safe and reliable transportation of pharmaceuticals and life science products has achieved continuous growth despite a decrease in the movement of COVID-19 vaccines. Etihad Cargo achieved IATA CEIV Pharma recertification in 2022 demonstrating the carrier’s full compliance with specific pharmaceutical regulations in terms of Good Distribution Practices (GDP) a quality system for warehouses and distribution centres dedicated to medicines. To further strengthen connections between Abu Dhabi and the rest of the world Etihad Cargo has developed over 1330 IATA CEIV Pharma and GDP-certified trade lanes which ensure the integrity of products during transportation. The carrier’s global MOU linking Abu Dhabi and Belgium’s pharma ecosystem dedicated pharma sales team and the establishment of Pharma Corridor 2.0 also contributed to an overall increase in pharmaceutical volumes.

The carrier also moved 6 per cent more horses via its SkyStables product in 2022 compared to the previous year. Contributing to this increase was a six-month peak season for east-to-west and then west-to-east travel to coincide with major equine events and the horse-racing season. In 2022 Etihad Cargo achieved IATA CEIV Live Animals certification becoming the first airline in the Middle East and only the third globally to hold the trilogy of IATA’s CEIV Live Animals CEIV Fresh and CEIV Pharma certifications.

The expansion of Etihad Cargo’s global network was a priority for the carrier in 2022. The airline offered additional cargo capacity with the introduction of new routes and increased frequencies.

“Etihad Cargo’s customers have benefited from increased belly capacity on widebody passenger flights to key destinations including Bangkok Brussels Dublin Guangzhou Johannesburg Kuala Lumpur London Madrid New York Singapore and Vienna” said Drew. “The carrier also introduced additional freighter capacity launching new services from Chennai and Shanghai. Through continuous review of its network Etihad Cargo has responded to increased capacity demand with agility. The carrier will continue to work closely with its partners and customers so it can add capacity to meet evolving customer requirements and market conditions.”

Etihad Cargo has built depth into its network and operates services to 68 destinations around the world. Via its expansive road feeder services network the carrier further connects 132 origin stations with 290 destination stations across the UAE GCC Europe North America Japan India and Australia via a fleet of over 30000 trucks.

In addition to expanding its global footprint Etihad Cargo took strides in its digitalisation journey in 2022. The carrier further enhanced its online booking portal and launched a Mandarin version of its website and booking portal to better meet the needs of customers in China a key market for Etihad Cargo. New updates including enhanced shipment tracking automated dashboards customised news feeds and look-to-book features have resulted in 39.3 per cent of online bookings being made through the online booking portal.94.1 per cent of all online bookings in China are completed via the portal.

The carrier also reinforced its commitment to customer service excellence in 2022 launching a new CRM system for its Customer Contact Centre to empower customer service agents with more customer-focused data. Transitioning to the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Pulse CRM system has provided Etihad Cargo’s customer service team with improved tools including an updated case management system and customer information such as the customer’s history purchase records sales interactions and a 360-degree view of customer queries.

Another core focus for Etihad Cargo during 2022 was sustainability and the carrier launched several initiatives and programmes that will help its customers meet their sustainability targets and benefit the wider air cargo industry. For example Etihad Cargo partnered with IATA to co-develop and trial a cargo-specific CO2 emission calculation tool which will provide a valuable proof of concept for the cargo component of the IATA CO2 Connect carbon calculator. Etihad Cargo was also the first middle eastern carrier to join TIACA’s BlueSky sustainability verification programme. To make the transportation of pharmaceuticals more sustainable the carrier entered into an MOU with B Medical Systems to develop and launch the world’s first airline-specific passive temperature-controlled container which will significantly reduce carbon emissions through an innovative design in terms of packaging type and size while still mitigating the main risks of potential breaks in the airline pharma supply chain.

Etihad Cargo’s performance and commitment to making the transportation of cargo smarter more reliable and efficient and greener have been recognised by the industry. The carrier received 25 awards in 2022 and was named cargo airline of the year by some of the sector’s most respected titles. Etihad Cargo also received awards for its contribution to the pharmaceutical transportation sector via its PharmaLife product innovation corporate social responsibility and sustainability.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm1hcmluZWluc2lnaHQuY29tL21hcml0aW1lLWxhdy90cmVuZHMtZXhwZWN0ZWQtdG8tZGVmaW5lLXN1cHBseS1jaGFpbnMtYW5kLXNoaXBwaW5nL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Trends Expected To Define Supply Chains And Shipping,"This article will discuss some of the trends defining supply chains and shipping in this year.

1. Markets returning to normalcy

Freeing up of capacity and tempering of freight rates has brought markets almost back to pre-Covid levels.

The most obvious and visible trend gaining ground since the third quarter of 2022 was the decline in ocean freight rates. After constantly increasing – to record levels – since the second half of 2020 freight rates first came under pressure post the Russia-Ukraine conflict when fears of the economic fallout started to dampen consumer sentiment and cast a shadow on international trade and freight transport. Rates continued to hover at record levels in Q2 2022 but thereafter began gradually declining in Q3 2022 before commencing a precipitate descent as we moved closer to the end of the year.

As of the beginning of 2023 ocean shipping rates have shed all the gains made in the last 2 years (except on the trans-Atlantic trade) and are now almost back to pre-Covid levels (defying analyst and carrier expectations of Covid bringing about a paradigm shift in the container shipping industry and creating a new normal where freight rates would stabilise at a level higher than the pre-Covid average).

This has been accompanied by lower demand in the US and European countries which resulted in fewer sailings thus ensuring that congestion vessel backlogs and equipment shortages were not exacerbated further and instead slowly started easing.

Finally as global congestion abated more vessels and capacity were freed up which was then available to transport cargo thus lessening the demand-supply disequilibrium and causing rates to moderate.

Looking at the trend over the last few months it is clear that the market has achieved some semblance of normality both in terms of rates and availability of capacity.

As we move into 2023 the probability of a return to the high freight rate environment seems quite low. Shippers can expect to benefit from relatively competitive rates and freely available capacity. Cargo movement is expected to be smoother and considerably faster than was the case in the last 2 years.

2. Global recession

As manufacturing activity dips and consumer sentiments turn negative the Shipping industry will experience a slowdown in the face of falling volumes.

The general worsening in the global economic situation and macroeconomic indicators has caused the international economy to slow down with apprehensions of an impending recession.

Indeed this has already become a reality in some countries with organisations such as the World Trade Organisation and the International Monetary Fund suggesting that certain economies in western Europe have already entered a mild recession and are further cautioning that the debilitating effects thereof will inevitably spill over to other underdeveloped economies and perhaps result in a worldwide recession akin to what was witnessed in 2009.

These recessionary pressures have already tempered global trade. A broad-based recession will affect all activities and variables in the supply chain ranging from production availability of raw materials timely transport of inventory vessel schedule reliability price volatility etc.

As we move into 2023 the deflationary impact of the slowdown is spreading further (geographically) and deeper (downstream and upstream) increasing the probability of a sustained downturn.

Most analysts have already revised the 2023 growth projections for the global economy and most major countries downwards. Even India which expert consensus places as a solitary bright spot in the otherwise gloomy situation has had its GDP forecasts slashed from 7.5% a few months back to around 6.5% (which was again revised upwards to 6.9% but contingent to several downside risks).

Globally the anticipation is that the recession’s severity will be mild but long-term. Consequently consumer confidence in developed countries has already taken a hit and discretionary spending is being curbed. The withdrawal of Covid-related fiscal stimulus by most Governments will also add to the recessionary effect.

The lower demand for goods and products will result in fewer factory orders and manufacturing activity in China and other manufacturing locations resulting in a decline in EXIM volumes – thus covering the entire supply chain.

In 2023 Carriers are expected to have surplus capacity and will likely drop rates to attract volumes benefitting cargo owners and end consumers.

3. Infusion of new capacity

The delivery of new builds ordered by Carriers will begin in Q2 2023 creating a capacity-surplus situation and pressuring freight rates.

While Carriers were circumspect about ordering new tonnage in the period immediately preceding Covid the acute paucity of tonnage and capacity in the succeeding months meant that Carriers paid exorbitant rates to procure all available tonnage.

Carriers therefore utilised the super profits to place orders for new vessels which is now expected to cause a capacity glut starting Q2 2023 onwards.

The aggregate orders for new builds account for circa 30% of the existing fleet. The deluge of tonnage coupled with dampened demand will further distort the supply-demand balance putting downward pressure on freight rates.

Since some of the older tonnages will inevitably be scrapped and Carriers will also attempt to moderate capacity through blanking scheduled sailings and slow steaming the net infusion of capacity is still expected to be higher than the forecasted demand.

Shippers will find this development to be in their favour as carriers will most likely follow the historical trend of undercutting freight rates to attract volumes in a sluggish market. Another benefit is that the new vessels will help ease congestion and alleviate space shortages.

4. Supply chains to be characterised by considerable uncertainty and lack of reliability

While the past 2 years were characterised by extreme volatility and a high degree of uncertainty (which amplified the effect of altered trade patterns and congestion causing rates to spike) there has been a marked improvement in the situation in recent months.

With consumer pessimism stifling demand for imported goods in most countries the corresponding dip in manufacturing activity in major Asian sourcing origins resulted in waning international trade volumes. This in turn caused capacity and equipment shortages to ease up steadily and the ensuing decline in incoming vessels and cargo volumes afforded congestion-plagued ports an opportunity to clear the backlog of volumes which helped in further easing supply chains.

The amelioration in the overall situation however does not imply that the underlying causes have vanished.

These risk factors are still at play and have the potential to roil international transport yet again in the forthcoming year.

This includes factors such as Covid outbreaks in China (which could spread to other countries as well) associated lockdowns and mobility restrictions labour troubles in countries across the globe lower production levels restricted labour availability and resultant operational and transport disruptions.

Another factor that will hamper supply chain reliability is cancelled sailings and revisions to published schedule schedules. As Carriers announce large-scale sailing cancellations to counter the weakening demand and thus improve vessel utilisation levels shippers will once again experience prolonged lead times delayed deliveries and deviations from planned transport schedules.

Carriers have already cancelled more sailings than usual in the run-up to the Chinese New Year and unless demand recovers in 2023 shippers can expect a continuation of sailing cancellations.

5. Greater costs of regulatory compliance

As IMO 2023 and other rules come into effect and emissions from shipping face increased regulatory and consumer scrutiny.

With the focus on making shipping ‘greener’ various legislations have been adopted by international agencies and individual governments. Additionally companies are voluntarily setting themselves ambitious targets for cutting emissions on a progressive scale each year with the intent of achieving carbon neutrality in the near future.

In this quest companies in 2023 will have to comply with certain emission control regulations which will increase their cost of operating either directly (such as through using fuels with low sulphur content) or indirectly (strict emission control laws rendering older vessels unviable and hence compelling carriers to scrap the vessels and invest in new tonnage).

The most wide-ranging among the new set of regulations is the IMO’s Carbon Intensity Index (CII) and the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS).

Under the CII each vessel will have to report its Annual Efficiency Ratio (AER) basis which the vessel will be assigned a grade between A and E. Vessels achieving a grading upto C will be considered to be compliant for one year while vessels graded D and E will be accorded a grade period of 3 and 1 years respectively to ensure that the vessel is compliant.

Vessel owners will have recourse to 3 courses of action to improve their grade which includes using fuels with lower sulphur content adopting tactics such as slow steaming or making changes to the vessel’s design and structure to lower emissions.

Under the ETS Carriers will have to purchase allowances for a certain proportion of the emissions generated by their vessels effectively foisting on Carriers’ higher costs who will most likely attempt to pass them to shippers.

The higher costs of lowering emissions could on certain routes be substantial and result in significant freight rate increases.

Ergo 2023 will witness an abnormal increase in the cost base of container carriers as apart from the normal increase in standard cost components they will be burdened with compliance costs. The deterioration in freight rates will lead to a diminution of the ability of carriers to absorb these additional costs wherefore they will be constrained to pass these on to shippers.

As an aside it might seem counter-intuitive that Carriers could drop rates due to low utilisation levels while also looking to pass regulatory compliance costs to shippers; however the fact is that these are two diverse factors exerting contradictory pressures. The likely outcome will be Carriers offering lower rates but the extent to which they can reduce rates will be lesser than under normal circumstances.

6. Covid-related disruptions

While we are well past the worst of the Covid pandemic and its impact on economic activity and international trade has waned we do see sporadic outbreaks especially in China.

In the initial Covid waves China managed to recover faster than most other countries principally due to its stringent Covid control measures which included imposing strict lockdowns and mobility restrictions. The subsequent backlash and the economic impact caused a reversal of its Zero Covid tolerance policy a couple of months back. This unfortunately backfired as the number of Covid cases surged and spread across the country.

The impact thus far on manufacturing and transport has been limited partly because the economic activity had already slowed due to the approaching Chinese New Year.

However as we move into the new year the repeated resurgence of Covid cases in China could pose a serious threat to global supply chains.

Should a severe outbreak require the imposition of lockdowns it would be safe to conjecture that the impact on port operations will cause prolonged delays in servicing vessels and cargo transportation times.

7. New Trends in Procurement gaining prevalence

Diversification of sourcing origins / China + 1 / Near-shoring / Friend-shoring

A combination of factors such as trade wars rising protectionist sentiment geo-political tensions and severely disrupted supply chains have brought to the fore the challenges associated with over-reliance on one (or a limited number of) sourcing locations.

Companies in the USA Europe and elsewhere faced the brunt of Covid-induced lockdowns in China (which meant both factories and ports were affected) and had to incur revenue losses due to their inability to procure adequate stocks in time.

Even prior to Covid companies with production facilities largely based in China or which were excessively reliant on Chinese manufactured components had encountered difficulties due to trade wars and geo-political tensions between various countries.

Besides the increasing tide of protectionist sentiment made Governments take steps to protect domestic industries and create disincentives for imports and outsourcing production and services overseas.

As companies have grappled with the extensive fallout of these factors since 2020 they have been compelled to adopt various tactics to diversify sourcing origins and strengthen supply chains to ensure they remain relatively insulated from macro-level developments.

Consequently we have seen the emergence of various procurement strategies explained below:

a. China + 1

Under this strategy companies are trying to develop a second sourcing origin apart from China by investing in manufacturing capacity in competing countries. Considering how deeply entrenched China is in global supply chains by the sheer scale of its infrastructure and manufacturing capacity other countries are unlikely to replace China in the short or medium term. Companies have however begun the process of shifting a certain proportion of their production to other countries.

These alternative sourcing locations include countries such as Vietnam Thailand Philippines and India the Governments of which have made strong efforts to pitch themselves as viable alternatives.

According to World Bank data Vietnam the Philippines and India are the most well-placed to benefit from this shift out of China with companies such as Apple already commissioned factories in India for manufacturing iPhones.

b. Near-shoring

Recognising the fact that the longer the distance in the transport process the more the probability of disruptions or unforeseen events delaying deliveries companies have started moving production closer home. This involves setting up factories in countries which are closer to their main markets so as to shorten the supply chain thus reducing turn times and risks as well.

With the steady erosion of China’s cost advantage (as salaries and cost of living started increasing) companies are scouring for other low-cost and efficient locations which offer similar advantages while also being located closer.

BMW and Mercedes are reportedly setting a base in Eastern Europe for their Electric Vehicle manufacturing while American companies are looking at options such as Mexico. Even Mazda was reported to be considering shifting the production of some components from China to their home market in Japan.

This trend is likely to gather steam in the forthcoming years with the number of possible alternatives depending on the company’s home base and major markets.

c. Friend-shoring

As tensions between the US and China ratchet up and they impose sanctions on each other companies are being encouraged to move production to countries which are friendly to their home country. This is intended to ensure supply chain security and also boost economic interdependence with friendly nations increasing the probability of a mutually beneficial long-term partnership.

The strategic purpose is to ensure that countries antagonistic to the host country do not have a bargaining chip in the form of critical component dependability which they can leverage in case of trade wars and hostilities. Another advantage is preventing one country from developing a monopoly over crucial raw material supplies.

A recent example involves the US trying to curb Chinese dominance in the manufacturing of semiconductor chips by encouraging other friendly countries to increase production.

8. New Trend in Inventory management

JIC vs JIT – businesses are adding buffers in Supply Chain by maintaining higher inventory levels.

After facing debilitating inventory shortages in 2021 and the major part of 2022 companies are also revisiting traditional inventory management techniques resulting in the Just in Case inventory management strategy gaining prominence.

Where companies have typically endeavoured to pare down inventory stocks to the minimum secure in the knowledge that the efficient and reliable international transport systems will ensure timely delivery of inventory the Covid crisis shook them out of their complacency.

Companies relying on Lean techniques and therefore holding limited stocks quickly found themselves unable to meet consumer demand as adequate and timely replenishments from overseas origins were not forthcoming.

As a consequence companies started ordering and holding higher levels of inventory as the opportunity costs of lost sales were considerably higher than the cost of holding excess inventory.

This concept is described as “Just in Case” (JIC) whereunder stock is held just in case there are delays in the supply of new orders. The concept of JIC was the diametric opposite of the traditional “Just in Time” (JIT) inventory management technique and marked a change in mindset.

With uncertainty expected to persist in 2023 more companies will adopt the JIC concept and hold higher-than-average inventory. The precise extent of increase in average inventory levels will vary depending on the industry turnover ratio the distance between sourcing origin and the market cost of holding inventory and the magnitude of potential revenue losses in case of inability to meet sales orders.

9. ILWU – PMA negotiations

Potential for causing large-scale disruptions at US West Coast ports

The ILWU-PMA negotiations between port worker unions at US West Coast ports and the Port Authorities pose a serious threat to the free trade flow to and from US West Coast ports.

While the current contract had already expired in June 2022 both parties are yet to conclude negotiations on a new agreement and dock workers have been working for 7 months without a contract in place.

In the event of a labour strike all movement of cargo through USWC ports would grind to a halt crippling trade completely. Shippers and trade bodies have been anxious about the outcome of these negotiations and in the meanwhile have been reconfiguring their supply chains to incorporate alternate ports/ routes and modes.

The most visible impact has been the inter-coastal shift in volumes from USWC to USEC causing USEC ports to be overwhelmed by the incremental cargo and leading to congestion and abnormal delays thereat. The magnitude of the shift has led to New York/ New Jersey replacing Long Beach and Los Angeles as the largest import gateways to the US.

Shippers and Importers are also looking at alternate ports in neighbouring countries like Canada and then hauling the cargo by rail to consumption centres in the US hinterland.

While this was flagged as a risk factor at the beginning of 2022 given how protracted the negotiations have been shippers and importers are viewing this with trepidation in 2023.

This is the most important foreseeable threat at USWC ports with the potential to significantly hamper NAM trade. The immediate outcome will be manifested in the form of lengthy vessel queues outside USWC ports containers piling up at port premises and delays of months for cargo delivery.

Other than revenue losses due to missed sales opportunities exporters and importers will also be left staring at huge detention and demurrage bills. The impact will inevitably spill over to USEC ports as more cargo is diverted thereat and thereafter to other countries as more vessels capacity and equipment will be tied up in congestion at USWC ports.

10. Rise of integrated logistics service providers

Looking to optimise the investment of the super profits made since 2020 Carriers are moving away from pure Container Shipping and foraying into Logistics Freight Forwarding Air transport Rail transport and Ports.

Carriers reaped record profits in 2021 and 2022 due to spiralling freight rates. The extent of liner profitability can be gauged from the fact that various estimates have put the aggregate industry profits for the last 2 years as being more than the combined profits over the past 2 decades.

The super profits have left Carriers flush with funds even after placing orders for new vessels and equipment. Carriers are deploying the surplus profits to boost their resiliency and create alternate revenue streams intended to help them sustain when the container market eventually stabilises.

As part of these diversification initiatives Carriers have expedited their efforts to foray into the logistics business and scale up their end-to-end delivery capabilities. Besides Carriers are now also increasingly investing in acquiring port assets to ensure that their vessels and cargo get priority while calling at their terminals – thus adding an element of stability and reliability to services.

It should be noted that the bigger Carriers have been ramping up their presence in the logistics and ports business for a few years now. Still the industry-wide profitability meant that even smaller carriers are treading this path now.

An even more interesting development is that Carriers are now investing in airlines and also inland train operators. Carriers like Maersk MSC and CMA-CGM now own aeroplanes while Maersk is also a serious contender for acquiring India’s government-owned container train operator CONCOR.

These additional investments in ports terminals air capacity train operators and logistics assets result from a conscious strategy to pivot away from a cyclical industry and develop a more robust organisation operating across the entire supply chain.

Quick Share

02 January 2023 New Delhi: Wheat is known as a lazy farmer’s crop as cultivating it does not require much effort except for timely sowing and watering. There are rare pesticide and fungicide sprays that keep the cost of cultivation low. This scenario is changing quickly for Madhya Pradesh farmers as the local wheat crop is seeing tobacco caterpillar infestation for the past two years.

Many villages of Depalpur tehsil in Madhya Pradesh have flagged the outbreak of tobacco caterpillars in the wheat crop. Farmers are spraying insecticides which are usually used for lepidopteran pests as there is no official recommendation of agrochemical from the Central Insecticides Board and Registration Committee (CIB&RC) on this pest for the wheat crop.

The outbreak of tobacco caterpillar in wheat has been seen at the ear formation stage. According to the farmers tobacco caterpillar was found more in the field having Tejas variety of wheat as compared to Lok-1. As per the Regional Officer of the Agriculture Department there is not much damage to the wheat crop in the tehsil as of now.

Lokendra Chaudhary a farmer of Karjoda village told Krishak Jagat “I have been seeing this pest for the last 2-3 years. It infested my wheat crop 15-20 days after sowing. There has been very little damage as I sprayed insecticide. To save the crop from tobacco caterpillars farmers are spraying Lambda Cyhalothrin Emamectin Benzoate 5% SC along with fungicides and Zinc.”

Dr. Anil Kumar Singh a scientist at ICAR-Indian Agricultural Research Institute Indore told Krishak Jagat “For the last 5-7 years pest infestation in wheat has started to come up. Since the wheat crop is a hardy crop pest does not cause much damage but can be lethal if they are in large numbers or above the economic threshold level (ETL).”

Dr. Singh shared “For those who have sown in October the stage of ear formation has started and these farmers need to be careful as the pest can cause heavy damage to the crop.”

The institution has suggested spraying Quinalphos 25 EC 800 ml/ha or Emamectin Benzoate 12.5 g AI/ha Emamectin Benzoate SC at 450 ml/ha and WG at 200 g/ha Broflanilide 300 SC at 50 g/ha Chlorantraniliprole at 150 ml/ha Flubendiamide 20 WG at 250 g/ha and Indoxacarb 350 ml/ha. The institute mentioned that there is no need to spray if the loss is less than 5 – 7%.

Dr. Singh mentioned that nowadays farmers are not giving a gap between Kharif and Rabi crops. Soybean is harvested by the first week of October and Wheat is sown immediately thereafter the eggs and larvae in the soil develop and move to the next crop. If a gap of 15-20 days is kept between the two crops the eggs/larvae get destroyed in the sun. Wheat can be sown till the first week of November or till the 20th of November. This will reduce the possibility of an outbreak of caterpillars.

Roy Cooper pointed out details on a tabletop architectural model of a huge building under construction in northeast Charlotte.

“It’s amazing” Cooper beamed “what a billion dollars can do.”

At the June 2021 gathering at Charlotte’s University Research Park Neidorff told Cooper Mayor Vi Lyles and others that 3230 employees would soon work in the 800000-square-foot structure for the nation’s largest Medicaid managed-care insurance company.

The $450 million in potential state and local incentive payments arranged by Cooper and others helped entice what promised to be one of North Carolina’s biggest economic-development home runs. Lyles hailed the project as a “milestone” for the area.

The plan called for a completed building by late 2022 when construction would be well under way on adjacent campus projects. Centene envisioned recreational areas a child-care site and other amenities.

It all sounded logical given Neidorff’s success in creating a Fortune 500 company with 71000 employees. Centene’s plans seemed akin to New York financial services giant TIAA which opened an adjacent 92-acre campus in 2000 that now employs 5000.

But Neidorff’s promises of new jobs and investment are now a distant memory.

In August Centene told Cooper it was quitting the unfinished project after investing $700 million. That’s more than triple the amount of money that Carolina Panthers David Tepper walked away from at his ballyhooed Rock Hill South Carolina development after disputes with municipal leaders earlier this year.

The Centene property which Neidorff said would become its East Coast headquarters is listed for sale by the Cushman & Wakefield real estate firm. It’s hoped that a major enterprise will pounce on the building — probably at a big discount. “They’re watching a couple of hundred million dollars evaporate” says a Charlotte executive who helped attract Centene.

Centene in a statement says the reversal reflects “a funda-mental shift in the way people want to work. About 90% of our workforce is fully remote or in a hybrid work environment and workplace flexibility is essential to attracting and retaining top talent.” Officials declined to elaborate.

The company is “drastically” office space across the U.S. as more employees work remotely or in hybrid settings notes Sam Chan Cooper’s press secretary. The company employs 1300 statewide including 700 in Charlotte.

But there was much more to Centene’s expensive incursion into the University City area near UNC Charlotte than bungled planning and a shifting workplace culture according to people familiar with the failed project. Several other factors behind the abrupt shift have received limited attention.

Perhaps most notable with all due respect is that Michael Neidorff is dead.

An infection claimed the CEO’s life in April at age 79 ending an increasingly fractious relationship with investors Centene’s home state of Missouri regulators board members and others. He had gone on medical leave two months earlier.

As the Charlotte project was rising Neidorff was facing growing dissatisfaction by institutional investors over the company’s financial performance and significant pressures from regulators over its operations.

In November 2021 he agreed with New York-based hedge fund Politan Capital Management to step down as CEO and executive chair in late 2022. The deal also included remaking Centene’s board with six directors leaving and five new ones added.

Politan owned less than 1% of Centene’s stock or about $900 million while Neidorff personally controlled about $500 million. But Politan founder Quentin Koffey had successfully forced management upheaval at his previous jobs. While working for the New York-based DE Shaw fund in 2018 he was credited with helping oust Robert Niblock who had been CEO of Mooresville-based Lowe’s Cos. for 13 years.

Given Centene’s long-term history investor complaints seemed surprising. It’s hard to understate Neidorff’s impact which in some ways mirrors Charlottean Hugh McColl Jr.’s skill of turning a regional bank into Bank of America.

The Altoona Pennsylvania native joined the health insurance company when it was based in Milwaukee Wisconsin in 1995. A year later he moved the headquarters to St. Louis where he had led a physicians-owned health plan. He took Centene public in 2001 when it had $327 million in revenue and 235000 members.

By 2013 revenue topped $10 billion with a membership of 2.7 million. Its rapid growth continued with revenue likely to top $135 billion this year. During the decade ended December 2021 the company’s stock soared more than 750% double the S&P 500 Index.

That history didn’t impress Politan which criticized Centene for profit margins that lagged peers causing its shares to stagnate between 2018-21. Also it isn’t unusual for hedge funds to target aging CEOs with unclear succession strategies. During his final years as CEO Neidorff received annual compensation of about $25 million. No other company executive topped $10 million.

Centene also faced headwinds because of criticism that it profits at the expense of its main customers low-income Americans. It’s the largest provider of health-insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces and the largest provider of Medicaid managed care with 15.4 million enrollees nationally.

Most state Medicaid programs contract with private insurers to cover people who have disabilities or low incomes. The programs are jointly funded by state and federal taxpayers. In many states the insurers procure medications for the program through a pharmacy benefit manager which acts as an intermediary between health plans and pharmacies. Centene has both a health plan and a PBM.

In September Texas became the 12th state to settle claims that Centene had defrauded their Medicaid programs involving excessive charges for pharmacy services. The settlements have totaled $475 million according to Kaiser Health News.

Centene has denied any wrongdoing and continues to operate in the states where it has struck settlements. But it set aside $1.1 billion to settle the allegations according to company filings. It’s not clear if Centene is under investigation in North Carolina.

Ohio Attorney General David Yost in an interview faults Centene for “corporate greed.” A Mississippi legislator accused the company of taking “$55 million of our money that was supposed to be spent on the poor the sick the elderly the mentally ill and disabled.”

Neidorff thought the big Charlotte site could help consolidate operations and improve Centene’s financial performance says a company official who asked to remain anonymous. It also reflected an emphasis on East Coast states after Centene’s $17 billion acquisition of Tampa Florida-based WellCare Health Plans in 2019. But questions on why companies need more office space spiked during the pandemic.

“The desire for flexibility in work was driving change” says Tobe Holmes senior director for land use and economic development of University City Partners a nonprofit that promotes the area where Centene planned to operate. He recalls discussing the issue with Gov. Cooper before the pandemic broke out in early 2020.

“Centene has some very skilled people and some call centers can be virtual with people who can discuss health care benefits. Others like in banking find people more efficient when they’re in the office together” Holmes says.

To be sure the pandemic has changed the landscape of corporate workplaces.

In Charlotte Duke Energy says remote work is enabling it to cut office-space needs by 60% which will save $90 million a year in real-estate leases. The company is consolidating its downtown Charlotte operations into the new 40-story Duke Energy Plaza slated to open in early 2023. The company ended its lease of 21 floors of the nearby Duke Energy Center and is selling its former 13-story headquarters building.

Other corporations have had second thoughts about remote work after measuring productivity. Last fall Bank of America limited the time that some staffers could work from home to two days a month. CEO Brian Moynihan has emphasized the benefits of building corporate culture through office work.

Centene’s cut-and-run also came amid significant tension between Neidorff and politicians in the company’s home state. Beyond his status building one of Missouri’s most successful companies he gained respect for promoting diversity long before it became popular in corporate America. He also made Centene a major philanthropic force in St. Louis which has struggled to retain major corporate headquarters.

Clayton Missouri Mayor Michelle Harris says she grew very fond of Neidorff. “He was a visionary leader and a person who’d take action on his visions. He didn’t just talk about it he went out and did it.”

Neidorff also wasn’t afraid to raise concerns publicly. In press interviews and comments to civic groups he complained about the increasing murder and crime rates in St. Louis.

Leading up to the location decision several Charlotte officials say that Neidorff repeatedly compared the Queen City’s crime statistics and available workforce favorably to similar metrics in St. Louis.

“Mr. Neidorff basically put a stake in the ground and said ‘Hell no St. Louis we aren’t doing this anymore” says a Charlotte official who asked not to be identified because of his role in recruiting Centene. “He was really angry at St. Louis but he kind of kept it under cover. He had a special bee in his bonnet about getting away from there.”

Neidorff also was disappointed that Missouri didn’t increase Medicaid funding according to several sources familiar with the matter. He met with Gov. Michael Parsons in 2021 but Press Secretary Kelli Jones declined to discuss the subject of the meeting.

Sources say Neidorff told Parsons that Missouri was an “embarrassment” for refusing to boost Medicaid funding his company’s core business. Missouri voters had approved an increase but Parsons refused to sign enabling legislation after the state’s Republican lawmakers declined to fund the growth. (North Carolina has not approved expanded Medicaid funding either.)

Whether the CEO threatened to move the company headquarters to Charlotte is unclear. Clayton Mayor Harris doubts it. “He cared very much about the St. Louis community at large and he was committed to the business community and trying to attract other companies here” she says. “His family lives here. I couldn’t imagine him saying that.”

To succeed Neidorff a month after his medical leave began Centene’s board picked a CEO with a very different history: Sarah London 41 had worked for a venture-capital division of rival United Healthcare before joining Centene to lead digital strategy in 2020. The Harvard University graduate and University of Chicago MBA is an expert in data analytics and technology innovation.

“[She] was the absolute opposite of Neidorff” says a Charlotte official who worked with the company. “This was a total change in attitude about what technology can provide for the future.” London had confidence that remote communications technology could serve customers with less need for office space.

“Mr. Neidorff was proceeding in a way the board didn’t appreciate” the executive said. “This gave her the leverage she needed to dump the project altogether.”

Centene paid $10 million for its initial 80-acre tract in University Research Park then added another 130 acres. It planned to pay average salaries topping more than $100000 according to data required to secure state incentives.

Writing off hundreds of million of dollars isn’t a major hit for Centene which has a market value of nearly $50 billion. Its stock gained about 4% this year through early December; the S&P 500 Index declined 14% in the same period.

It’s unclear if the building will end up in the hands of a single tenant or include multiple occupants says Jade Hubbard a spokesperson for Cushman & Wakefield. The building remains unfinished.

Holmes the University Research Park official says “Centene was locating in University City for a reason and those reasons still exist.” It’s the region’s second-largest employment center with close proximity to nearby UNC Charlotte.

“That’s exactly the kind of environment that has legs” he says. ■",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMifmh0dHBzOi8vbGFidXNpbmVzc2pvdXJuYWwuY29tL2hlYWx0aGNhcmUvbWVkaWNhbC1jZW50ZXIvc2Nhbi1ncm91cC1tZXJnZXMtd2l0aC1vcmVnb24tbWFuYWdlZC1tZWRpY2FyZS1hbmQtbWVkaWNhaWQtbm9ucHJvZml0L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scan Group Merges with Oregon Managed Medicare and Medicaid Nonprofit,"This article has been revised and corrected from the original version.

Long Beach-based Scan Group a senior health care nonprofit and Portland Oregon-based CareOregon a managed care nonprofit have agreed to merge under the new name HealthRight Group.

The merger which was announced last month is intended to give both nonprofits more clout in a marketplace for government-funded health care programs increasingly dominated by for-profit managed care providers such as Long Beach-based Molina Healthcare Inc. and St. Louis Missouri-based Centene Corp. parent of Woodland Hills managed care provider Health Net. The deal is expected to close sometime this year. Scan Group which has about 1600 employees is the parent company of Scan Health Plan which had revenue of around $3.6 billion in 2021. It has about 275000 members mostly in California but also in Arizona and Nevada. In December Scan started enrolling people in Texas.

CareOregon has been focused on providing managed care for low-income individuals through government subsidy programs especially Medicaid. It’s similar to Westlake-based L.A. Care which provides health care for the nearly 25% of Angelenos who meet low-income thresholds. It has about 515000 members with nearly 320000 of those in various Medicaid plans.

Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. According to the Dec. 14 announcement the new combined HealthRight Group entity will have revenues of about $6.8 billion and will serve nearly 800000 health plan members through its Medicare and Medicaid managed care offerings.

While the announcement did not say where HealthRight Group will be headquartered its designated chief executive Sachin Jain and board chair Linda Rosenstock currently hold those same posts with Scan Group in Long Beach. CareOregon Chief Executive Eric Hunter will retain that post and serve as president of HealthRight’s Medicaid Division.

Jain specifically referenced the aim of gaining more clout in the government-funded health care provider space.

“For far too long America’s not-for-profit managed care organizations have operated at a scale disadvantage to their larger for-profit competitors” Jain said. “HealthRight aims to bring together two complementary organizations to benefit from greater scale while maintaining focus on the people and communities they serve.”

In addition to its health plans HealthRight will operate a diversified business unit comprising assets from both organizations including Welcome Health a geriatric home-based primary care medical group; Housecall Providers an in-home primary and palliative care provider; MyPlace Health a joint venture between Scan Health and Boston-based Commonwealth Care Alliance; Healthcare in Action a medical group for people experiencing homelessness; and HomeBase Medical a medical group focused on improving chronic disease management and palliative care for Medicare beneficiaries.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vbWVkaWNpbmUud3VzdGwuZWR1L25ld3MvZHJ5LWV5ZS1kaXNlYXNlLWFsdGVycy1ob3ctdGhlLWV5ZXMtY29ybmVhLWhlYWxzLWl0c2VsZi1hZnRlci1pbmp1cnkv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Dry eye disease alters how the eye's cornea heals itself after injury – Washington University School of Medicine in St ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='medicine.wustl.edu', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/dry-eye-disease-alters-how-the-eyes-cornea-heals-itself-after-injury/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3E7F2B0>, 'Connection to medicine.wustl.edu timed out.

In 2022 Post and Courier journalists dug deep uncovering cozy deals shady practices and outright abuses of power. Taken together their work represents a breathtaking portfolio of questionable conduct and stinging injustices.

Newspaper-led investigations revealed how a judge in Greenwood used his position to boost his family's real estate holdings. And how a lawmaker failed to hand over $600000 in taxpayer funds to charities — until our reporter began asking questions.

Reporters examined working conditions at a Charleston-area shipyard with a troubling safety record. They shined a light on the region's high-flying tourism machine which takes in tens of millions of dollars with little public scrutiny. They told stories about people whose pleas for help had been ignored — stories that otherwise might not have seen the light of day.

Exposing these stories takes time resources and tenacity. With help from our reader-powered Investigative Fund reporters pursued requests for thousands of documents and sifted through reams of reports. They battled bureaucrats and questioned power brokers who weren't happy that journalists were asking tough questions about their actions.

This journalism triggered legislative action policy changes criminal investigations and difficult community discussions. It underscored the role newspapers play in holding power to account. And it served as a reminder that South Carolina might look very different had these stories remained untold. Here's a look back at some of this work.

Mold and modern day slavery

Our statewide project “Mold U” began with a mystery.

Last spring Amya Carr a student at South Carolina State University in Orangeburg was rushed to a hospital with breathing problems but it was too late. She died from what campus police said was asthma.

In the wake of Carr's death the newspaper learned that her dorm complex had a history of mold complaints. But neither SC State nor the Orangeburg County coroner had records that showed they investigated mold as a possible asthma trigger.

These unanswered questions led to a broader look at mold in dorms across South Carolina. The result was an unprecedented finding that thousands of students had reported mold in their dorms and that school administrators often downplayed their concerns.

Mold U was done under the umbrella of The Post and Courier-led Uncovered project an effort to expose questionable conduct especially in areas of the state where newspapers have shrunk or closed.

College newspapers also have been hard-hit so the newspaper worked with The Daily Gamecock at the University of South Carolina and The Tiger at Clemson University to capture students’ stories such as Kayra Rice's near death from mold exposure. Rice was a student at Francis Marion University who had a severe reaction to mold and eventually transferred to USC because of it.

""It seemed like nobody really cared"" Rice told Tony Bartelme lead reporter on Mold U.

Stories such as Rice's would have remained buried unless reporters began asking questions. The same is true in Sumter County when Melissa Addison a former lieutenant with the Sumter County Sheriff's Office came forward with an explosive rape allegation against Anthony Dennis now the county's sheriff.

Addison told the newspaper she had reported the allegation to the state Law Enforcement Division but that investigators had done little to investigate her claims. Bartelme began interviewing witnesses SLED had failed to contact. His report found that SLED indeed botched the investigation.

“It sort of fell through the cracks” SLED chief Mark Keel later told the newspaper.

The findings triggered a new SLED investigation but the state Attorney General declined to prosecute. Dennis has maintained his innocence throughout. But Addison said she was happy that her voice had finally been heard.

Another example of how journalism gives voices to those who have been silenced is project reporter Jennifer Berry Hawes' account of an intellectually disabled Black man held captive by a Conway restaurant owner.

Hawes spent months investigating and chronicling the story of how restaurant employee Christopher Smith had been burned beaten and tortured while being forced to work 100 hours a week without pay.

Hawes used open records laws to collect investigative files 911 tapes and other records critical to tell the story. She interviewed key players in the saga including Smith himself to provide the first full account of this harrowing tale of modern day slavery.

Hawes and colleague Zharia Jeffries also shed light on the mysterious death of a 3-year-old who went into respiratory distress after being placed under anesthesia in February for a dental procedure at a Hilton Head surgery center.

Their June story revealed that the center had failed to notify the state health department of the death as required by law. As a result the state cited the center for the omission and required it to draft a corrective plan.

From monkeys to schnauzers



Many Post and Courier projects explore gray areas of ethics and influence. A prime example was “Monkeys and Blood.”

Using open records requests reporters Shamira McCray and Bartelme revealed that pharmaceutical company Charles River Labs poured millions of dollars into the state Department of Natural Resources by renting an agency-owned island. Charles River used the island to breed monkeys for lab experiments.

But DNR then used that money to pay staffers including some who regulated Charles River’s other lucrative business: collecting horseshoe crabs to make a valuable substance that detects toxins.

When presented with the newspaper’s findings a top DNR official said it never crossed his mind that this tangled relationship might be perceived as a conflict of interest.

In response a state lawmaker filed a bill to make commercial fishing in South Carolina more transparent. Later in 2022 state and federal officials nixed efforts by Charles River Labs to collect crabs in protected wildlife areas.

In April Watchdog editor Glenn Smith exposed a former Charleston County jail director’s ties to a controversial consultant and a shadowy plan to buy intimidating giant schnauzers to keep inmates in line.

The story sparked fresh questions and conversations about the jailer’s possible connection to the breeding and sale of these dogs with a consultant who had earned hundreds of thousands of dollars through no-bid contracts at the detention center on his watch.

Questionable judgment

The state's judicial system often is among the most difficult to penetrate. But in April project reporter Thad Moore exposed how a judge in Greenwood oversaw foreclosure hearings in which family members snatched up bargain properties.

The judge told Moore that he didn't think he was doing anything wrong. But the state's chief justice saw it differently and stripped the judge of his powers over foreclosures.

Meanwhile in July U.S. District Court Judge Joe Dawson received a rare public reprimand from the Judicial Council for the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals — a direct result of David Slade's reporting the year before.

Slade's earlier reporting had shown how Charleston County paid Dawson $216000 in exchange for an ethically fraught promise of services to the county while serving on the federal bench. Dawson himself wrote that contract while serving as the county’s lawyer.

In addition to the large cash payment the contract surprisingly called for Dawson to receive a percentage of any settlement Charleston County snagged from national opioid litigation. Slade's reporting triggered the filing of the federal judicial ethics complaint. Dawson's contract was amended to eliminate the provision giving him a cut from the opioid lawsuits.

And in October Smith got his hands on long-buried recordings of a 2017 incident in which another judge allegedly tried to orchestrate the improper arrest of a troubled man in her neighborhood.

The tapes revealed sheriff’s deputies’ discomfort with Circuit Judge Carmen Mullen’s reported attempts to “make stuff up” to place the man in custody.

Attorneys contacted the state’s judicial watchdog after the story published to request an investigation into Mullen’s actions with one describing the incident as “very troubling.”

Conflicts and cozy deals

The Post and Courier has for years pointed spotlights at our state lawmakers exposing shady campaign spending and conflicts of interest. Last year was no different.

Today's Top Headlines

In June veteran Statehouse reporter Seanna Adcox dug deep into a multimillion-dollar pile of state budget earmarks and found some with direct ties to lawmakers’ families.

Lawmakers aren’t supposed to use their positions to benefit themselves their relatives or their businesses. But Adcox found examples of money flowing to a company that employed a lawmaker’s son. She identified another company that hired a legislator’s daughter as a lobbyist.

Lawmakers later struck $33 million in earmarks from the state budget. About 85 percent of that money had been designated for earmarks Adcox featured in her reporting.

Adcox also pored over the qualifications of candidates for South Carolina’s top education post. She wanted to see if they complied with a little-known law requiring the state education superintendent to have a master’s degree. She found at least three did not.

After her reporting two candidates withdrew from the race. A third quickly moved to earn a master’s before Election Day.

Meanwhile a series of Uncovered reports this summer by Avery Wilks revealed a bizarre power play involving state Sen. Karl Allen of Greenville.

Wilks discovered that Allen had withheld hundreds of thousands of dollars in state grants to charities by simply holding onto their checks.

Days after the newspaper’s initial story Allen scrambled to deliver the money. But the paper continued to dig deeper uncovering Allen's long pattern of holding back state money from charities who needed it to serve underprivileged children and low-income seniors.

The Post and Courier’s reporting raised concerns about how often lawmakers were allowed to hand-deliver the money all so they could schedule photo ops and soak up credit.

In response Gov. Henry McMaster issued an executive order requiring state agencies to wire state grant money directly to their intended recipients cutting out middlemen like Allen.

Explanatory journalism

An important function of journalism is to help readers better understand complex issues so they can make better decisions for themselves and their communities. An example: reporter Emma Whalen's ""Tunnel of Trouble.""

Whalen examined the City of Charleston’s most expensive ongoing public works project a massive tunnel under downtown to speed drainage on the city’s West Side and medical district.

Poring through thousands of pages of contracts and reports she revealed how a cascade of faulty assumptions planning failures and subsequent construction delays set the project back 10 years from its initial timeline and three years behind a revised schedule.

These delays helped send the project $44 million over budget — delays that come as a changing climate and rising seas put the city in greater peril.

Above ground after the rushed evacuation of an unstable beachfront high-rise in Myrtle Beach Post and Courier project reporter John Ramsey spoke to people caught in the dash to leave the building and began to explore whether the corrosion that destabilized the tower may be more widespread along the South Carolina coast.

Reporters Hawes Moore Briah Lumpkins Doug Pardue and Richard Caines joined in that effort producing a compelling report that showed hundreds of buildings potentially lie in harm's way yet South Carolina has no requirements for structural re-inspection of any high-rise after construction.

Bold journalism also challenges institutions that on the surface appear to be models of success such as Charleston Area Convention & Visitors Bureau the Lowcountry tourism promoter often referred to as Explore Charleston.

Last fall a Post and Courier and Frontline PBS investigation found that during the past 20 years nearly $150 million taxpayer dollars given to Explore Charleston had been spent with little to no oversight.

The report by Lumpkins and Pardue exposed the failure of local governments to ask hard questions about the cash they handed over year after year. And it documented the same failure by a state oversight board.

After a worker fell to his death at Detyens Shipyards Inc. in North Charleston — the fourth on-the-job fatality there since 2019 — The Post and Courier discovered a pattern of injuries and unheeded safety concerns at the shipyard. Reporters Moore and Hawes also found that a U.S. Navy command awarded Detyens hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of contracts even after its commander raised alarms over safety issues and federal inspectors repeatedly dinged its lax oversight of basic safety rules.

Moore and Hawes also went into action when news broke that tens of millions of dollars had seemingly vanished from the AME Church’s pension fund with scarce details of what happened.

They dug into lawsuits public records and internal church documents to fill in the gaps. They found that the vast majority of the pension’s supposed wealth was actually a mirage trumped up by inflated estimates for investments that turned out to be worthless. Church leaders had invested millions of dollars with a now-defunct venture capital firm in Texas before the firm vanished without a trace; a busted real-estate deal left the church with part of an undeveloped island in Florida.

And in the wake of a March shooting that killed a 12-year-old student in Greenville County The Post and Courier’s Education Lab team analyzed hundreds of thousands of disciplinary write-ups from South Carolina schools. They found that the number of instances of weapons in schools had more than doubled since 2018 — a substantial increase at a time school shootings were on the rise.

In May education reporter Maura Turcotte also explored the potential promise and pitfalls of summer school learning throughout the state.

She found that many districts relied on virtual learning despite studies questioning its effectiveness. She also learned that no state standards exist for summer education and that few districts were able or willing to provide any data on academic performance — critical information parents need to know.

In October Education Lab editor Hillary Flynn did an in-depth look at the state’s efforts to improve Allendale County public schools one of the worst-performing districts in South Carolina and the subject of two state takeovers.

Flynn’s story addressed a dire need for coverage in a county that remains South Carolina’s lone true news desert a place that has lacked a hometown newspaper since 2015.

Accountability Reporting

Any parent knows that their kids probably behave differently without watchful eyes. The same is true with public officials. But as smaller newspapers struggle some of this scrutiny is vanishing.

The Post and Courier's ongoing Uncovered project filled this void by leveraging the newspaper's investigative reporting resources with the on-the-ground knowledge of community journalists.

In March The Post and Courier’s Uncovered team worked with The Kingstree News to reveal that Williamsburg County Clerk of Court Sharon Staggers had taken advantage of her position to pay herself $30000 from a pot of federal child support money she controls.

The bonus boosted Staggers’ annual take-home pay to nearly $93000 nearly three times the median household income in her impoverished county.

The newspaper’s reporting explained how quirks in the law left other county officials powerless to stop her even though they felt the bonus was wrong. In response the FBI launched an ongoing investigation into Staggers and the pay hike.

In Richland County a Post and Courier investigation by Wilks found major problems with employee spending at Richland One School District including multiple reviews of misspending that the state’s ninth-largest school system either minimized or ignored.

The newspaper’s reporting made the issue difficult to ignore despite officials' claims that they had addressed the spending issues. Ultimately state Attorney General Alan Wilson got involved calling for more scrutiny of the school district.

So did the state grand jury which in October indicted a former district employee on charges of swindling more than $20000 in public money. And the state Department of Education in December put Richland One on “fiscal watch” after a follow-up audit of the school system’s spending found the problems persisted.

Also in Richland County a tip about the county's new jail director Tyrell Cato led reporter Skylar Laird to discover that he had been fired from his previous job in Kershaw County over sexual misconduct allegations. She dug deeper and found Richland County had never done a background check on Cato going against state regulations.

In the wake of her reporting Richland County fired Cato and SLED launched an investigation into why a Kershaw County employee submitted paperwork indicating that Cato left his previous job voluntarily. What's more the Criminal Justice Academy is investigating Richland County after it failed to follow state protocol in running a background check.

Secrets of small towns

Deep dives also can be informative and fun. Moore explored the secrets lingering in rural Lee County where 34 years ago something crept out of the bottomlands and into the national consciousness.

Ever since the Lizard Man of Bishopville has stirred mixed feelings in the area. The creature has been viewed alternately as a potential economic boon for a small community an embarrassment that played out on the national stage and a genuinely frightening event that left many feeling mocked. Moore's account gave voice to the county’s residents and the creature’s fans.

From Lizard Man to political corruption the newspaper’s investigative journalism in 2022 highlighted a universal human need to solve mysteries uncover what people are trying to hide — learn from other people’s stories so we can make better decisions in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But lawsuits and threats from patent trolls have been an obstacle to the dream of a free and open internet. That’s why EFF has been fighting back against them for more than 15 years.

Patent trolls are companies that are focused on suing and threatening over patents not on offering actual goods or services. Very often they use software patents to sue over basic business processes like making picture menus or taking event photographs. It’s all too easy to get patents on things like this because the patent system is just a bad fit for software.

In the first 3 quarters of 2022 64% of all patent lawsuits were filed by patent trolls—companies whose primary focus is making money from patents not providing services or goods. In the high-tech space patent trolls filed 88% of all lawsuits.

Defending Our Progress

Since EFF has started working to improve the patent system we’ve seen a few big steps forward like the introduction of inter partes review (IPR) and the 2014 Alice v. CLS Bank Supreme Court ruling.

The Alice precedent which is more than 8 years old now has done a good job of knocking out many software patents that never should have been issued in the first place.

EFF’s “Saved by Alice” project has highlighted some of the small businesses and individuals who have benefited from the more balanced approach courts have taken since the Alice ruling.

However patent trolls and companies that extensively license patents have long been lobbying against Alice. This year we saw an attack on the law that we knew would come eventually. An extreme bill the “Patent Eligibility Restoration Act” would have eviscerated Alice completely and allowed for some of the worst software patents to make a comeback. It would have even legalized the patenting of human genes a practice that is ruled out under current Supreme Court precedent.

This bill didn’t advance in the current Congress in part because many EFF supporters spoke out about it and contacted their Senators. But because patent trolls and other pro-patent extremists have so much to gain by chipping away at Alice we don’t expect it will be the last attempt to turn back some of the progress we’ve made.

Two Big Steps Forward for Sunshine in the Patent System

In September EFF got a big win in our long-running case seeking to unseal records related to Uniloc’s patent trolling. This case began in 2018 as an effort to understand heavily redacted filings in a patent infringement case between Uniloc a patent troll and Apple.

Thanks to our litigation the great majority of Uniloc’s previously secret court records are now public. That includes most of a table of licensing agreements that Uniloc used to convince a private equity firm called Fortress to fund its patent-trolling activities.

In November EFF got involved in a case where several patent troll companies were under scrutiny by a Delaware federal judge who was concerned that the true owners of the patent trolls had “perpetrated a fraud on the court.” The trolls’ lawyers sought to have an appeals court shut down the investigation. EFF filed a brief in that case to explain why it’s critical that judges be allowed to demand more information about the patent troll companies that are utilizing our public courts for their business. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit accepted EFF’s brief denied the petition brought by patent troll Nimitz Technologies and allowed the investigation to proceed.

Because of cases like the ones EFF got involved in federal courts are increasingly demanding more disclosure in patent cases including disclosures about litigation funding. That’s a positive trend. Patent trolls rely on secrecy to perpetuate their business. When the public and elected officials learn more about how they operate it becomes clear that our patent system needs big changes in order to be a real public benefit.

Investors at the stock market have not had the best of times in 2022. There is a strong possibility of a recession in the United States economy in early 2023 and the IMF predicts global growth will slow to 2.7% this year the weakest pace since 2001 as GDP growth is projected to be only 1%. A tight labor market and rising wages will likely remain a key concern for businesses in the coming months.

It is projected that the Fed will likely continue to raise interest rates in 2023. According to recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) research it has been projected that core PCE inflation in 2023 will be 3.5%. The central bank will likely raise interest rates by at least another 0.5 percentage points by March 2023 to reach its goal. Various high-ranking Fed officials have recently signaled that they would like to maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance throughout 2023.

However the investor exodus from the stock market has also created buying opportunities. As one of the oldest and best-performing investment vehicles in the United States - the benchmark indexes have rarely delivered back-to-back negative returns in consecutive years - investors are excited about the possibility of earnings season offsetting some of the blowback from rising rates. The possibility of peak inflation and a continued downward trend in prices has also boosted investor interest in the market.

Some of the top stocks that could benefit from this recovery momentum include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Retail investors who have become an important market force in recent years are also likely to make a strong comeback at the market in light of easing concerns around inflation. Investments in high-growth stocks are thus projected to rise up exponentially in the coming months.

“There are a few other segments of our portfolios that displayed weakness in the quarter. Cable and telecommunication companies have been an area that has lagged behind the broader market as their worlds are increasingly colliding. Companies such as Verizon (NYSE:VZ) have been impacted as the wireless operator is spending heavily to attract internet subscribers with fixed wired access and the cable companies are trying to build wireless businesses.”

12. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 66

Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) engages in integrated energy and chemical operations worldwide. Chevron’s Texaco Exploration & Production reported that total oil and gas production in January 2022 was 509.62 boe/d. The oil production in 2022 stood at 3682.74 bd.

In its Q2 2022 investor letter Meridian Funds an asset management firm highlighted a few stocks and Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that while the memory industry is cyclical we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”

10. Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 15

In its Q2 2022 investor letter Bireme Capital an asset management firm highlighted a few stocks and GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Amazingly GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) is one of our only short positions to not fall in 2022. The stock trades at an $11.5b market cap exceeding its pre-pandemic peak by billions of dollars. This is even though revenue is down 30% from the peak gross margins are down 1500 bps and the company has generated a negative free cash outflow of $700m in the last four quarters (we had to double-check that number because it is so high). Wall Street has consistently revised downward their estimates of Gamestop’s profitability making its stock price stability in 2022 even more perplexing. Analysts currently estimate an EBITDA loss of around $400m markedly worse than their estimates as of 2/3/22 of a loss of $60m. Their recently launched NFT marketplace will do nothing to fix their core business and comes about a year too late to be relevant in the NFT space. Instead we see this as another example of a meme stock company hoping it can ape its way into a new business model utilizing the popularity of the stock to drive new lines of business. We are not optimistic and think the $11.5b market cap drastically overestimates the capability of Gamestop to pivot into something more profitable. We find it unlikely that Gamestop books a GAAP profit ever again.”

8. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. (NYSE:AMC)

Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18

“At the beginning of April the CSRC (China Securities Regulatory Commission) announced possible changes in its regulation that would allow this inspection by foreign auditors provided that the companies previously communicate to this body the state secrets that would be exposed as well as the sensitive information that they might have to hand over and the subsequent audit is carried out in a framework of collaboration with the CSRC. In short a move in the direction desired by the SEC although still far from the optimal result that is unrestricted access to information. While these negotiations between the two regulatory bodies are progressing Chinese companies have to decide how best to preserve their interests. Other entities such as the electric vehicle manufacturer Nio have just started trading on this stock market.”

In its Q3 2022 investor letter Leaven Partners an asset management firm highlighted a few stocks and Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“In our last quarterly letter I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported as of June 17 Wall Street expected S&P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022 which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September as major players such as Ford (NYSE:F) have recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6% [2] from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.”

The wonder state is a wild place that’s just waiting to be explored. Their abundant parks include mountains caves rivers and hot springs. After all it’s home to the rugged Ozarks. But you’ll need some good food to fuel your adventures. That’s why we’ve created this ever-growing guide to restaurants bakeries cafes and ice cream shops in Arkansas that are friendly to dairy-free diners. It’s a collection based on research and reader recommendations (send yours!) that’s divided into restaurants & shops by city (first) and major chains found throughout the state (second). And we’ve started a section for specialty dairy-free foods produced in this state.

We Update Continuously! You can ignore the original date on this post going forward. We update the information below whenever we’re alerted to a new recommendation change or closure.

Dairy-Free Arkansas: Recommended Restaurants & Shops

Barbecue is big in Arkansas so you won’t have too much trouble finding BBQ and smoked meats that are naturally dairy-free. It’s often served with a side of beans and watermelon. Arkansas is also the unofficial home of soybeans in the U.S. so don’t be surprised to see edamame on the menu.

But we’ve been on the hunt for a bigger taste of Arkansas without dairy. We’ve listed these recommendations alphabetically by city and then by the restaurant or shop name. For large chains with locations throughout the state see the Major Restaurant & Grocery Chains section below. We have dedicated posts with dairy-free details for many of the big guys.

Some 1200 people attended the unexpectedly emotional gathering.

Heidelberg's famous Church of the Holy Spirit a 600-year-old edifice in the town's historic city center was the scene of an unusual religious service on Sunday where some 1200 congregants came together to pray and contemplate (and enjoy) a performance of US pop star Taylor Swift's songs as part of a special liturgy.

Staged under the name ""Anti-Hero — Taylor Swift Church Service"" organizers at the Protestant church said the event was conceived to attract younger people as well as to focus on the profound religious convictions expressed in many of Swift's songs.

Swift — who was not at the service but rather on her latest European tour — was raised in the American ""Bible Belt"" and has never hidden her Christian beliefs often integrating these into her music.

This was what inspired church organizers. ""The Church of the Holy Spirit has always been a place of encounter and exchange. That's why a pop-music religious service fits so perfectly"" said Heidelberg Pastor Christof Ellsiepen. ""With it we are giving space to the questions and issues that occupy the younger generation.""

A contemplation of the gospel according to Tay-Tay

Though the idea might suggest a wild concert atmosphere it was largely one of quiet devotion.

Parish Pastor Vincenzo Petracca quoted numerous lyrics and traced Swift's biography emphasizing her attachment to and understanding of Christianity in everyday life.

Petracca acknowledged that Swift's songs are open to numerous interpretations but highlighted the strong Christian — and political — messages she integrates into her songs which address the subjects of women's rights racism and gender equality among others.

The pastor noted however that such topics have made Swift the object of criticism in conservative Christian circles especially among Evangelicals in the US who have branded her ""anti-Christian.""

Swift herself has chastised ""hypocritical faith"" that puts dogma before people. The pastor emphasized as well that ""her faith knows doubt and inner-conflict.""

""Theologically speaking she points to the justness of God"" says Petracca adding ""For her faith and action are inseparable.""

A congregation moved to tears and dancing in their pews

Throughout both Sunday services — two were staged in order to accommodate the large number of people who attended — the congregation which was notably younger and and more female than is often the case were treated to live performances of six Swift songs.

These were performed by Tine Weichmann — a singer from Hamburg and now a professor of popular church music in Heidelberg — and her band. Behind them a rainbow-colored sign reading ""Everybody is welcome!""

One of the most emotionally stirring moments of the service came when Weichmann and her band performed ""Soon You'll Get Better."" Swift wrote the song for her mother who had been diagnosed with cancer.

The lyrics she penned speak to desperation and the healing powers of medicine — and of prayer: ""Holy orange bottles each night I pray to you / Desperate people find faith so now I pray to Jesus too.""

Pastor Petracca who admitted the Church of the Holy Spirit was ""built for Gregorian liturgical music and not for Taylor Swift"" said of the service ""I stared into beaming faces — and during the song that Taylor wrote for her cancer-stricken mother many had tears in their eyes.""

But no Swift-themed service would be complete without an uplifting communal outburst of joy which is exactly what happened when the band struck up the concluding hymn ""Shake It Off!"" This brought the entire congregation to their feet singing and dancing before breaking into furious applause.

""Anti-Hero"" was just the latest in a series of ""City Church Rock 'n' Pop"" services started in 2015.

This June the Church of the Holy Spirit has invited guests from across Europe to take part in a street dance service that will be held at the same time as its ""Church Battle"" dance competition.

Instead of a relatively unobstructed view of Cedar and Rattlesnake mountains overlooking the city now anyone looking that way will see a large yellow crane. It’s waiting in eager anticipation to help build a controversial Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints temple that a group of local residents are trying to stop in Park County District court.

Later this month a final hearing will be held in the lawsuit that was filed by neighbors of the proposed temple site and others trying to block its construction.

The decision made by Johnson County Judge John R. Perry coming out of the May 23 hearing will likely determine if construction of the temple can begin.

In the meantime the church seems ready to start as soon as it’s able with a host of large shipping containers with components of the temple being moved to the temple site off Skyline Drive.

Outrage

Many in Cody expressed outrage on social media this week that not only had the crane been moved to the proposed site but so have modular units for the proposed Cody LDS temple. These storage units contain materials for the 101-foot-tall temple’s construction.

The church announced in a press release this week that because the previous spot the containers were stored is no longer available it had to move them to a site adjacent to where the temple will be built.

As first reported by Cowboy State Daily in 2023 these items were being stored at Y-Tex Corp. a business owned by a member of the church who had donated the land for the temple.

“This new storage location will avoid future crossings of public roads with these modular units during the temple construction” said Jimmie Edwards second counselor for the LDS Cody Wyoming Stake in a press release. “The church is not yet commencing construction of the temple.”

The church owns the temple property and is fully allowed to use the site to keep the containers there.

But many locals say the optics look bad and that it serves as evidence that construction of the temple is inevitable.

Others defend the project saying it’s hypocritical that critics aren’t similarly outraged about two historic buildings that were torn down in the city earlier this year.

Not So?

The nearly 10000-square-foot temple sparked controversy mainly because of the size of the building and its steeple on an almost 5-acre piece of land overlooking Cody. Some living in the neighborhood say the steeple will destroy their viewshed and the temple will have other negative impacts like ruining the night sky and creating more traffic.

The temple dispute is a topic that has dragged on for more than a year in Cody. The issue has riled up the community causing a clear divide between those who support and oppose the project.

Cody resident Dylan Wood who runs youth ministries in town said he’s very disappointed with how some people have been speaking about the temple online particularly those he knows to be of the Christian faith using scripture in what he sees as a distrustful and hateful manner.

“There’s been some really hateful stuff from people who are ‘Christians’ and it really hurts my heart” he said.

Wood said people need to remember the Ten Commandments which state that “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.”

Although he’s under no illusion that Cody is perfect Wood said many people seem to prefer being upset about something rather than appreciating the positivity in the community around them. Five years down the road after the temple is finished Wood believes the community will have already forgotten about it.

Carla Egelhoff an organizer with Protect Our Cody Neighborhoods (POCN) a group fighting the church in court hasn’t forgotten about the temple yet. Egelhoff said she isn’t personally bothered by the materials being moved to the temple site but has no idea if the church is telling the truth about why it is moving them.

Optimism

Egelhoff said she believes her group’s case is strong. POCN is challenging the decision made by the Cody Planning and Zoning Board (PZB) to allow construction of the temple last August.

“POCN has entered compelling legal arguments based on the Wyoming State Statutes and Cody city ordinances in support of a decision to reverse the PZB decisions and remand the conditional use permit and the site plan back to the City of Cody” Egelhoff said.

If the judge doesn’t rule in POCN’s favor Egelhoff said the group will consider filing an appeal with the Wyoming Supreme Court.

Egelhoff also mentioned how the Cody City Council approved a number of changes as a result of how the temple approval process played out. Most notably this includes more deference to the city’s master plan and notification to landowners in a larger range around a proposed project for a conditional use permit (CUP).

According to the Cody Enterprise  under the new code if 20% or more of the property owners object to a project the PZB can only make a recommendation to the city council which then gets the final decision. In the past only Planning and Zoning Board members had a final say on CUPs.

“The change of number of neighbor notifications and handling of nearby affected property owners input is welcomed at this time” Eglehoff said. “Significant opposition to requests that are outside of current zoning ordinances ought to be addressed by elected officials. More opportunities for citizen participation will be positive for Cody into the future.”

Also when a site plan is under consideration there now must be approval from the majority of the board not just the members present at a meeting which aligns with Wyoming law. This had been a major source of contention at a meeting last summer where a majority of the board members present at a meeting rejected its site plan not the board as a whole.

Learn about First Church of Cannabis how it started how to join,"Did you know Indianapolis has a place of worship dedicated to marijuana?

Testing the bounds of religious freedom this establishment was created to respond to Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act opening its doors the same day the law went into effect.

""This is what I live by and I have more faith in this religion than any other"" Bill Levin founder of the Church of Cannabis told IndyStar in May 2015. ""This is my lifestyle. This is millions of people's lifestyle."" Here's what we know.

Indiana Marijuana LegislationCould Indiana decriminalize marijuana after a recent DEA announcement? Here's what we know

What is the Church of Cannabis?

The First Church of Cannabis was founded by Levin in 2015 in response to Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act which was signed into law by former governor Mike Pence on March 26 2015 and went into effect on July 1 2015.

When the law finally went into effect on July 1 the doors of Levin's beloved establishment opened that same day as previously reported by the IndyStar. According to the First Church of Cannabis website the group's mission is to ""celebrate life's great adventure by building on compassion good health and love.""

While the group is unable to participate in the ""holy sacrament"" of being able to light up at their regular Wednesday service they've found other ways to fill the time according to the IndyStar. A typical service starts with a shorter sermon from Levin before opening the floor to members to discuss concerns. They also perform a ""diety dozen"" with affirmations of marijuana as a means of healing. Learn more about the ""diety dozen"" here.

Where is the First Church of Cannabis?

The First Church of Cannabis is located at 3400 S Rural St. in Indianapolis.

Who founded the First Church of Cannabis?

Levin 68 founder and leader of the First Church of Cannabis is a long-standing marijuana advocate who began working with the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) in the late 19990s according to the church's website. He eventually started his own pro-cannabis organization ReLegalize Indiana.

Levin also ran for political positions as a Libertarian in the early 2010s with marijuana legislation as a key focus but came up short. When the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was passed ""Bill took this as an opportunity to establish The First Church of Cannabis on the basis of 'Cannatarian' religion where love is the most important and including the sacrament cannabis"" according to Church of Cannabis.

Marijuana Church challenges Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act

Levin and the Church of Cannabis filed a lawsuit against the state of Indiana Pence and Attorney General Greg Zoeller in July 2015 with the claim that denying them the right to smoke in public infringes on religious freedom. A second lawsuit was filed on March 3 2016 against the city of Indianapolis the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department and former Police Chief Rick Hite.

The filed suits argued that members' use of marijuana at the Church of Cannabis should be protected under Indiana's Religious Freedom Restoration Act but was dismissed by the Indiana Court of Appeals in December of 2018.

""I feel sorry for the people who are not educated in this subject matter"" Levin previously said to the IndyStar. ""We'll keep doing what we're doing because we're doing God's work.""

Demolished church being replaced,"JENISON MI – People driving along busy Baldwin Street over the past week may have noticed a cross-adorned steeple sticking out of a pile of rubble.

The work demolishing a church and accessory building are part of a project to build a private daycare and early learning center for children 6 weeks old through kindergarten on the property at 1675 Baldwin St. in Georgetown Township.

The facility will be operated by Primrose Schools an Atlanta-based chain with more than 500 early childhood education centers across the U.S. including one in Michigan near Ann Arbor.

Officials with Primrose Schools say the demolition is complete and the school is expected to be open a year from now. They anticipate having capacity for up to 200 children and will also provide an afterschool program.

“Children at Primrose schools benefit from the exclusive time-tested Balanced Learning approach” Primrose Schools officials said in a statement to MLive/The Grand Rapids Press. “Created from the best early education wisdom it balances purposeful play with nurturing guidance from teachers to encourage curiosity creativity confidence and compassion.”

The 3.68-acre site was formerly home to the First Reformed Protestant Church which sold the property to real estate development firm EIG14T in September 2023 for $925000 according to Ottawa County property records.

Officials with the First Reformed Protestant Church could not be reached.

Primrose Schools said it wouldn’t have been feasible due to building size and cost to refit the existing church and accessory building for the early childhood education center.

According to township planning documents there is no record of when the church was built. Records show there was an addition to the main church building in 1987 and that the additional building was constructed on the site in 1997.

Since the 1980s the church has had different designations including Baldwin Heights Baptist Solomon’s Porch Community Church and finally First Reformed Protestant Church.

The church changed hands to the First Reformed Protestant Church in May 2021 when it purchased the property for $750000 from Solomon’s Porch Community Church according to Ottawa County property records.

That same year the Association for Covenantal Reformed Education had received special land use approval for a proposed private K-12 school on the property but that school never came to fruition according to township documents."

The 950000-square-foot office complex was designed to house about 4000 employees of Tennessee's biggest health insurer in a more secure and efficient setting. But a decade after its completion much of the sprawling 5-building complex BlueCross built on Cameron Hill remains vacant as most workers are now doing their job at home not at the office.

When the Covid-19 pandemic quickly forced BlueCross to move thousands of workers out of the office in March 2020 Chattanooga's biggest private employer quickly changed the way it did business and in the process discovered that most employees like working from home better and are actually often more efficient than when they are working at the office.",,,,,,

It’s still open.

Here are five things to know about the matter:

Who took the Clermont Senior Services money?

Greg Carson the chief financial officer for the nonprofit serving older adults was hailed as an ethical public servant and family man when he died suddenly in January at the age of 48.

But authorities said they soon discovered that Carson had been embezzling money for a dozen years before he died of atherosclerotic and hypertensive cardiovascular disease.

What did Greg Carson use the money for?

Carson bought everything from high-end sunglasses to yard equipment according to Clermont Senior Services and a forensic accountant working on behalf of the agency.

The accountant said Carson made suspicious purchases with money transfers from the organization's general operating account and credit cards and credit cards believed to belong to Williamsburg Township.

He said Carson made unauthorized purchases of personal property through Amazon and Sam’s Club falsely identifying them on Clermont Senior Services’ general ledger as legitimate expenses.

For example ATV tires were described as technology supplies home theater components as equipment-maintenance expenses and a bike rack as office supplies.

The forensic accountant said a preliminary investigation determined the amount of money Carson is confirmed to have embezzled is likely just a portion of his money grab at Clermont Senior Services.

County prosecutor says further investigation unnecessary

Clermont Senior Services paused its probe saying said it needed financial help to continue it.

Instead the Clermont County prosecutor’s office and the state attorney general’s Bureau of Criminal Investigation told Clermont Senior Services in late May that further investigation was unnecessary.

“After considering the absence of information indicating anyone other than Greg Carson was involved in these allegations and since there were no living suspects further criminal investigation (is) not warranted” Prosecutor Mark Tekulve said.

New investigation launched

Another division of the attorney general’s office the Charitable Law Section subsequently told a lawyer for Clermont Senior Services that it intended to pursue a criminal investigation of the loss of funds which are supposed to be spent on things such as adult day care housing home repairs transportation and Meals on Wheels.

“While the situation remains an open investigation our legal team has recommended that we not make comment at this time” Bill DeHass CEO of Clermont Senior Services said in December.

The state attorney general’s office does not confirm the existence of or potential for investigations agency spokesman Steve Irwin has said.

Aleem Maqbool

Editor bidang agama BBC News

2 Januari 2023

Mary Elizabeth telah menjalani kehidupan yang saleh sederhana dan sunyi sebagai suster Ordo Karmel dalam agama Katolik. Selama bertahun-tahun dia menghabiskan hari-harinya dalam sebuah sel ordo tersebut di Inggris Utara.

Tetapi sebuah pertemuan singkat dengan seorang biarawan berujung pada sebuah pesan: ""Apakah kamu rela meninggalkan ordomu dan menikah dengan saya?""

Kisah ini bermula ketika Suster Mary Elizabeth menyentuh lengan baju seorang biarawan di ruang tamu biara di Preston Lancashire. Kejadian tersebut mengubah hidup Suster Mary yang telah menjadi biarawati selama 24 tahun.

Awalnya kepala biara Ordo Karmel di Preston meminta Elizabeth bertemu dengan bruder Robert yang sedang berkunjung dari biara Karmel di Oxford untuk menawarkan makanan kepadanya.

Namun kepala biara pergi sebentar untuk menjawab panggilan telepon. Sehingga dia meninggalkan mereka berdua saja.

""Itu pertama kali kami berada di satu ruangan. Kami duduk di meja dan dia makan. Ketika kepala biarawati tidak kembali saya mempersilakannya keluar ruangan.""

Saat Suster Mary Elizabeth membukakan pintu bagi Robert secara tak sengaja dia menyentuh lengan baju sang bruder dan dia merasakan sebuah setruman.

""Saya merasakan koneksi emosional saat itu sesuatu dan saya malu akan perasaan tersebut. Dan saya pikir aduh apakah dia merasakan itu juga. Dan ketika saya mengiringinya keluar ruangan saya agak canggung.""

Sekitar seminggu kemudian ia menerima pesan Robert yang bertanya apakah dia mau meninggalkan ordo untuk menikah dengannya.

""Saya sedikit kaget. Saya mengenakan kerudung sehingga ia tidak pernah melihat warna rambut saya. Ia tidak mengetahui apapun tentang saya sebenarnya ia tidak tahu mengenai masa lalu saya. Bahkan ia tidak tahu nama asli saya"" ungkap dia.

Sebelum memasuki Ordo Karmel pada usia 19 tahun Suster Mary Elizabeth dikenal dengan nama Lisa Tinkler yang berasal dari Middlesbrough.

Meski orangtuanya tidak beragama ziarah tantenya ke Lourdes membangkitkan sesuatu di dalam Lisa yang berumur enam tahun. Bahkan ia meminta kepada ayahnya untuk mendirikan altar di kamarnya.

""Saya memiliki patung kecil Bunda Maria di atasnya dan botol kecil berisi air dari Lourdes. Sebenarnya saya pikir yang suci adalah botolnya bukan airnya - sehingga saya terus mengisinya dari keran dan minum air itu"" kata Lisa.

Lisa kemudian menemukan salah satu gereja Katolik Roma di kotanya dan ia duduk sendirian di barisan kedua.

Di situlah ia menumbuhkan rasa cinta mendalam kepada Bunda Maria ibunda Yesus serta perasaan bahwa dia punya panggilan.

Sebuah retret yang digelar di biara saat ia masih remaja membuat dia semakin yakin akan panggilan itu. Biara itu diurus oleh para suster Karmel dari ordo yang didirikan sejak abad ke-12.

Kehidupan di situ cukup sederhana terpencil dan ketat - tetapi dia memutuskan bahwa itulah kehidupan yang ingin dia jalani.

Keterangan gambar Robert tumbuh besar di Polandia namun menjadi biarawan Ordo Karmel di Oxford.

Walaupun Lisa ingin langsung bergabung ibunya - yang sebenarnya kurang setuju dengan keputusan anaknya - diam-diam menulis surat kepada kesusteran untuk meminta kepergian Lisa ditunda beberapa bulan. Supaya Lisa dapat menghabiskan satu Natal terakhir di rumah.

Ia bergabung pada tahun baru.

""Sejak saat itu saya hidup bagaikan pertapa. Kami mendapatkan waktu rekreasi dua kali sehari selama setengah jam. Saat itu kami boleh berbicara tapi di luar waktu tersebut kami berdiam diri di bilik masing-masing. Kami tidak bekerja dengan siapapun selalu sendirian"" kata Lisa Tinkler—nama Suster Mary Elizabeth sebelum menjadi biarawati.

Beberapa tahun berlalu Suster Mary Elizabeth mulai merasa perbendaharaan katanya berkurang karena dia tidak punya banyak hal untuk dibicarakan bersama biarawati lain yang umurnya jauh di atas dia.

Ia hanya bisa membicarakan cuaca dan keindahan alam di kebun. Ia hanya bertemu dengan ibunya empat kali lewat jeruji.

""Saat saya berulang tahun yang ke-21 kue saya dan kartu-kartu ucapan dikirim lewat laci. Dan ketika keponakan saya lahir ia dibawa lewat meja putar"" katanya sambil tertawa mengingat kembali momen itu.

Dia menjabarkan bagaimana ia merasa 'dunia internal' terbuka namun dunia luar mulai tertutup baginya. Ada perasaan tenang dan puas.

Keterangan gambar Lisa smengatakan sebelum bertemu Robert ia tidak tahu seperti apa rasanya jatuh cinta.

Akan tetapi pada hari itu di ruang tamu biara segalanya berubah dengan sentuhan lengan dan pesan yang memintanya untuk meninggalkan kehidupan biarawati untuk menikah.

Suster Mary Elizabeth tidak memberikan Robert jawaban dan tidak tahu harus berbuat apa.

Meski Robert tidak tahu apa-apa tentang dirinya Suster Mary Elizabeth tahu sedikit tentang dia.

Saat bruder Robert berkunjung dari Oxford ke pusat retret Karmel di Preston Robert kerap kali memimpin misa di biara terdekat. Suster Mary Elizabeth menyimak khotbahnya dari balik jeruji.

Dengan mendengar anekdot yang bruder Robert bawakan Suster Mary Elizabeth mendapatkan sedikit pengetahuan tentang kehidupannya. Bruder Robert dibesarkan di Silesia Polandia dekat perbatasan Jerman dan begitu cinta pada pegunungan.

Meski begitu Suster Mary Elizabeth mengakui khotbah sang biarawan tidak memiliki pengaruh besar padanya.

Kini tiba-tiba semua berubah.

""Saya tidak tahu bagaimana perasaannya jatuh cinta dan saya pikir suster-suster lain bisa melihatnya di wajah saya. Saya menjadi gugup. Saya merasa ada yang berubah dalam diri saya dan itu menakutkan bagi saya"" katanya.

Suster Mary Elizabeth akhirnya memberanikan diri untuk bercerita kepada kepala biaranya mengenai perasaan yang ia miliki untuk Bruder Robert tetapi ia hanya mendapat tanggapan tidak percaya.

""Dia tidak mengerti bagaimana itu bisa terjadi sebab kami berada di bawah pengawasannya sepanjang waktu. Sang kepala biara bingung bagaimana kami bisa jatuh cinta dengan kontak yang sangat singkat itu"" kata Lisa.

Suster Mary Elizabeth sudah membayangkan reaksi keluarganya atau uskupnya jika ia meninggalkan biara. Ia juga bergumul dengan perasaan apakah hubungannya dengan Tuhan akan berubah.

Tetapi percakapannya dengan kepala biara membuat dia melakukan sesuatu yang mengejutkan.

""Kepala biara cukup galak terhadap saya jadi saya mengenakan celana dan memasukakn sikat gigi ke dalam tas dan keluar dan saya tidak permah kembali sebagai Suster Mary Elizabeth"" ujar Lisa Tinkler kepada saya.

Bruder Robert mengirim pesan kepada Lisa yang mengatakan ia berencana berkunjung ke Preston lagi di sore hari. Kali ini untuk bertemu teman Karmel untuk meminta saran di bar terdekat.

Temannya merupakan orang pertama yang ia percayai untuk tahu tentang situasi dia dan Lisa.

Lisa menebak mereka akan bertemu di restoran Black Bull sekitar satu mil di jalan jadi ia memutuskan untuk pergi ke sana.

Namun bukannya menjadi momen yang menyenangkan Lisa malah terlempar ke dalam kekacauan yang mendalam pada malam November 2015 itu.

Keterangan gambar Robert mengaku ketakutan saat melihat Lisa di restoran.

""Hujan deras turun saat saya menelusuri jalan Garstang. Mobil-mobil datang ke arah saya dengan lampu depan yang terang dan saya hanya berpikir 'Saya bisa mengakhiri ini'"" katanya merujuk pada keinginannya untuk bunuh diri sesaat.

""Saya benar-benar berjuang saya pikir saya harus mencegah ini terjadi agar Robert dapat melanjutkan hidupnya. Tetapi saya juga bertanya-tanya apakah dia benar-benar yakin dengan apa yang dia katakan tentang [ingin] menikah.""

Tapi Lisa terus berjalan sampai dia tengah malam dalam kondisi basah kuyup tanpa mantel dalam pakaian susternya di luar restoran Black Bull. Dia baru memberanikan diri untuk masuk ke dalam ketika dia melihat sang bruder duduk di dalam melalui pintu yang terbuka.

""Ketika saya melihatnya jantung saya berhenti"" kata Robert.

Tetapi sebenarnya saya lumpuh karena rasa takut bukan kebahagiaan karena saya tahu pada momen itu bahwa saya harus sepenuhya memberikan diri untuk Lisa tetapi saya juga tahu kami belum siap untuk itu"" kata dia.

Robert sudah menjadi biarawan Karmel selama 13 tahun sampai titik itu. Ia seorang pemikir akademisi dan teolog yang masuk ke dalam kehidupan biara untuk mencari makna dalam apa yang ia gambarkan sebagai krisis iman dan identitas.

Ketika sekarang dia menengok ke masa lalunya ia merasa cara dia dibesarkan membuat kebingungan itu tidak bisa dihindari. Ia dibesarkan di wilayah yang baru beralih dari Jerman ke Polandia dengan ayah yang beragama Kristen Lutheran dan ibu yang memeluk agama Katolik.

Tetapi periode itu cukup gelap baginya setelah hubungan yang gagal membuat Robert terus mencari rasa pemenuhan di Inggris - terlepas dari teologi Protestan Lutheran yang telah ia anut - di biara Katolik Roma Ordo Karmel di mana dia menemukan pelipur lara.

""Sebelumnya saya tidak tahu banyak tentang Karmel dan tidak pernah memikirkan ingin menjadi biara. Padahal saya selalu curiga akan bentuk ekspresi kepercayaan apapun"" kata Robert.

Tetapi ia mengatakan ordonya mengajarkannya untuk menerima kegelapan kesulitan dan krisis itu hingga ia merasa tenang. Namun pertemuannya dengan Lisa yang saat itu ia hanya kenal sebatas namanya Suster Mary Elizabeth yang memutarbalikkan hidupnya.

Keterangan gambar Robert memulai hidup baru pada usia 53 tahun.

""Sentuhannya pada lengan baju saya memulai suatu perubahan. Meski saya merasa ada sesuatu yang perlahan tumbuh dalam hati saya tidak pernah merasa jatuh cinta secara tak waras karena dengan menjadi biara atau suster kami diajarkan cara mengatasi emosi itu"" kata Robert.

Ia menjelaskan pesannya kepada Lisa yang memintanya untuk menikah merupakan pergulatan intelektual dengan dirinya.

""Saat dia hadir di bar setan kecil dalam diri saya ketakutan. Tetapi rasa takut bukanlah terkait iman atau kepercayaan saya melainkan mengenai bagaimana saya akan memulai hidup baru pada usia 53 tahun"" kata dia.

Perubahan itu sulit terutama pada awal-awal. Lisa mengingat sebuah momen menjelang Natal setelah mereka meninggalkan kehidupan biara.

""Saya melihat Robert dan dia terlihat tertekan dan menangis. Pada saat itu kami berdua telah mencapai titik terpuruk dan merasa seperti kami seharusnya meminum sesuatu seperti Romeo dan Juliet untuk mengakhiri semua ini"" kata Lisa.

""Sulit sekali karena kami berdua merasa sangat sendirian dan terisolasi dan kami tidak tahu harus melakukan apa untuk melangkah maju. Tetapi kami berpegangan tangan dan melewati semua itu"" kata Lisa.

Mereka menceritakan momen di pusat penyaluran tenaga kerja saat mereka mencucurkan air mata ketika ditanya mengenai keahlian mereka - dan saat mereka mengendarai mobil dari Preston ke Yorkshire.

""Saya membeli buku dalam bahasa Polandia tentang para biarawati yang meninggalkan ordo mereka dengan berbagai alasan. Saya membaca dan menerjemahkannya bagi Lisa dalam mobil. Tetapi ia harus menepi di jalur M62.""

""Kami berdua sampai menangis karena kisah-kisah itu sangat emosional dan kami bisa terhubung dengan mereka"" kata Robert.

Keterangan gambar Lisa menjadi pendeta di rumah sakit sedangkan Robert menjadi pendeta Gereja Anglikan.

Hal yang membawa mereka damai menjadi hal yang mengarahkan mereka ke biara di awal - terhubung dengan keyakinan personal.

""Sepanjang hidup religius mereka mengatakan hati kami seharusnya tak terbagi dan diberikan sepenuhnya kepada Tuhan. Tiba-tiba saya merasa hati saya tumbuh lebih besar untuk merangkul Robert tetapi saya sadar bahwa hatiku masih mampu menampung segala hal di dalamnya. Saya tidak memiliki perasaan berbeda tentang Tuhan dan itu meyakinkan saya"" kata Lisa.

Lisa pertama bekerja di rumah duka dan kemudian sebagai pendeta rumah sakit.

Meski ia sempat sedih setelah menerima surat dari Roma yang mengatakan dirinya sudah tidak lagi menjadi anggota Ordo Karmel Robert kemudian diterima oleh Gereja Inggris.

Mereka menikah dan kini tinggal bersama di kampung Hutton Rudby di Yorkshire Utara. Di sana pula Robert ditahbiskan sebagai pendeta di gereja setempat. Mereka masih dalam proses beradaptasi dengan kehidupan di luar biara.

Terutama Lisa yang sudah terisolasi selama 24 tahun dan tidak memiliki kehidupan akademik seperti Robert mengaku merasa seperti pengamat dunia luar. Baru sekarang dia mencoba-coba gaya rambut dan gaya berpakaian apa yang cocok untuknya setelah ia tidak lagi wajib mengenakan baju suster.

Mereka berdua masih merindukan beberapa aspek kehidupan ordo. Lisa bahkan mengatakan jika tidak ada Robert ia akan kembali menjadi biarawati Karmel besok.

Kami sudah terbiasa dengan kesunyian dan kesendirian dua hal yang sulit ditemukan dalam urusan duniawi. Anda ditarik ke segala arah sehingga terus menjadi tantangan bagi saya dan Robert untuk terpusat dan tenang"" kata Lisa.

Tetapi mereka menemukan solusi yang ampuh.

""Saya sering merasa seperti saya hidup di biara bersama Robert seperti dua orang dari Ordo Karmel yang melakukan segala hal untuk Tuhan. Kami memusatkan diri kita pada doa tetapi cinta bisa membuat sakramen untuk semua yang kami lakukan dan saya menyadari tidak ada yang benar-benar berubah bagi saya"" katanya.

Lisa mengatakan mereka berdua setuju bahwa ada tiga orang dalam pernikahan mereka.

""Tuhan ada di tengah pernikahan ini dan didahulukan di atas segalanya. Kalau kami menghilangkannya saya pikir kami tidak akan bertahan lama.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5pZG50aW1lcy5jb20vaHlwZS9lbnRlcnRhaW5tZW50L2FubmlzYS1rdXN1bWEtd2FyZGhhbmkvam9uYXRoYW4tYW5kcmlhbm8tcmFuZHktZGktc2VyaWVzLXN1cmF0LWNpbnRhLXVudHVrLXN0YXJsYS1jMWMy0gGGAWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlkbnRpbWVzLmNvbS9oeXBlL2VudGVydGFpbm1lbnQvYW1wL2FubmlzYS1rdXN1bWEtd2FyZGhhbmkvam9uYXRoYW4tYW5kcmlhbm8tcmFuZHktZGktc2VyaWVzLXN1cmF0LWNpbnRhLXVudHVrLXN0YXJsYS1jMWMy?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,10 Potret Jonathan Andriano Randy Surat Cinta untuk Starla,"Follow IDN Times untuk mendapatkan informasi terkini.

Lombardo took the governor’s oath administered by Nevada Supreme Court Justice Lidia Stiglich.

Lt. Governor Stavros Anthony Controller Andy Matthews Treasurer Zach Conine and Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar were also sworn in at the event held in the Old Assembly Chambers of the State Capitol Building.

The swearing in ceremony is stipulated in Nevada law requiring the incoming governor to be sworn in on the first Monday in January. Tomorrow there will be a formal inauguration ceremony held at noon at the Carson City Community Center.

Lombardo narrowly defeated incumbent Democrat Steve Sisolak yet will face a majority Democratic legislature when they convene in early February.

On the campaign trail Lombardo promised to diversify the economy champion school choice vouchers and initiatives and repeal certain bills related to “soft on crime policies.”

As reported by The Globe the Democratic legislature in 2019 passed AB236 which decreased penalties for drug trafficking. Lombardo told The Globe:

“The statutes in AB 236 associated with sentencing and penalties related to narcotics trafficking burglary and larceny. The legislative body reduced felonies to misdemeanors and this has made it very difficult to make an arrest in that space. The legislature tied our hands in our ability to make an arrest in a violation of criminal law. In my opinion it is very frustrating for us to respond to a call from a person in need and we can’t do anything about it or have an individual held responsible for the actions they conducted in a criminal space.”

After his victory in November Lombardo released this statement:

“I’ve dedicated my life to protecting and serving our community and now I’m honored to have the opportunity to protect and serve our entire state as your next governor.

Our victory is a victory for all Nevadans who want our state to get back on track. It’s a victory for small business owners for parents for students and for law enforcement.

It’s a victory for all Nevadans who believe that our best and brightest days are ahead of us. Of course this victory wouldn’t have been possible without the tireless work and patience of my incredible family staff supporters and volunteers.

Thank you for fighting for the future of our state alongside me during this campaign. Nevada from the bottom of my heart thank you for trust you have placed in me. Donna and I can’t wait to get to work for our state in Carson City.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vbGFzdmVnYXNzdW4uY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy9qYW4vMDIvam9lLWxvbWJhcmRvLXN3b3JuLWluLWFzLW5ldmFkYXMtMzFzdC1nb3Zlcm5vci_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Joe Lombardo sworn in as Nevada's 31st governor,"Joe Lombardo sworn in as Nevada’s 31st governor

Republican Joe Lombardo is officially the Nevada governor as the former Clark County Sheriff took the oath of office this morning to become the 31st governor in state history.

At a small swearing-in ceremony inside the Nevada Capitol Nevada Supreme Court Justice Lidia Stiglich administered the oath to Lombardo as well as new Lt. Gov. Stavros Anthony Nevada Controller Andy Matthews and incoming Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar as well as Nevada Treasurer Zach Conine who a began a second term.

The only state executive not sworn in at the ceremony was Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford who will take his oath at a separate ceremony later Monday.

After reciting the oath Lombardo flanked by First Lady Donna Lombardo signed the Certificate of Election officially swearing him in as governor while congratulating the others assuming office as well.

“I’m looking forward to a wonderful term” Lombardo 60 said.

Another separate ceremony open to the public will be noon Tuesday at the Carson City Community Center — a day later than usual as the state is celebrating the New Year’s Day holiday on Monday.

Lombardo bested Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak in November’s general election riding a wave of overwhelming support in the state’s rural counties and solid turnout from voters in and around Las Vegas and Reno to take the governor’s mansion by about 1.5% or about 15000 votes.

He will have to navigate Democratic majorities in both legislative chambers to enact his priorities especially in regards to campaign promises like education and economic reform.

In the Nov. 8 general election Democrats won a 28-14 supermajority in the Nevada Assembly and a 13-8 edge in the Nevada Senate. Any legislation that makes it to Lombardo’s desk will need bipartisanship support or else risk being vetoed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL3NlY3VyaXR5L3doYXRzLWluLXN0b3JlLWZvci1jeWJlcnNlY3VyaXR5LWluLTIwMjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What's in store for cybersecurity in 2023,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='venturebeat.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /security/whats-in-store-for-cybersecurity-in-2023/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E4261750>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vdmVudHVyZWJlYXQuY29tL3NlY3VyaXR5L3doYXRzLWluLXN0b3JlLWZvci1jeWJlcnNlY3VyaXR5LWluLTIwMjMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3RvZGF5LmluL2pvYnMvc3RvcnkvaWl0LWd1d2FoYXRpLXBsYWNlbWVudC0yMDIyLTIzLWhpZ2hlc3QtcGFja2FnZS1vZi1ycy0yNC1jcm9yZS1hbWF6b24tZ29vZ2xlLW1pY3Jvc29mdC10b3AtcmVjcnVpdGVycy0zNTg1MTctMjAyMy0wMS0wMtIBogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3RvZGF5LmluL2FtcC9qb2JzL3N0b3J5L2lpdC1ndXdhaGF0aS1wbGFjZW1lbnQtMjAyMi0yMy1oaWdoZXN0LXBhY2thZ2Utb2YtcnMtMjQtY3JvcmUtYW1hem9uLWdvb2dsZS1taWNyb3NvZnQtdG9wLXJlY3J1aXRlcnMtMzU4NTE3LTIwMjMtMDEtMDI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,IIT Guwahati Placement 2022-23: Highest package of Rs 2.4 crore; Amazon Google Microsoft top recruiters,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMingFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3RvZGF5LmluL2pvYnMvc3RvcnkvaWl0LWd1d2FoYXRpLXBsYWNlbWVudC0yMDIyLTIzLWhpZ2hlc3QtcGFja2FnZS1vZi1ycy0yNC1jcm9yZS1hbWF6b24tZ29vZ2xlLW1pY3Jvc29mdC10b3AtcmVjcnVpdGVycy0zNTg1MTctMjAyMy0wMS0wMtIBogFodHRwczovL3d3dy5idXNpbmVzc3RvZGF5LmluL2FtcC9qb2JzL3N0b3J5L2lpdC1ndXdhaGF0aS1wbGFjZW1lbnQtMjAyMi0yMy1oaWdoZXN0LXBhY2thZ2Utb2YtcnMtMjQtY3JvcmUtYW1hem9uLWdvb2dsZS1taWNyb3NvZnQtdG9wLXJlY3J1aXRlcnMtMzU4NTE3LTIwMjMtMDEtMDI?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E42635B0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

An ex-boyfriend is now accusing the Republican Congressman-elect who fancies himself as the ""full embodiment of the American dream"" as a man of whoppers — as well as a thief.

In 2015 former boyfriend Pedro Vilarva says that Santos surprised him with a tropical vacation in Hawaii that didn't really exist according to the Seattle Times. He also allegedly stole Vilarva's phone and then most likely hocked it. He later found out Santos was wanted by the Brazilian police by doing a simple Google search.

From The Seattle Times:

Vilarva met Santos in 2014 when he was 18 and Santos was 26. Vilarva found him charming and sweet. They dated for a few months before Santos suggested they move in together. Vilarva said he felt on top of the world — even if he said he did find himself footing many of the bills. ""He used to say he would get money from Citigroup he was an investor"" Vilarva recalled. ""One day it's one thing one day it's another thing. He never ever actually went to work"" he said. Things began to unravel between the two men in early 2015 Vilarva said after Santos surprised him with tickets to Hawaii that turned out not to exist. Around the same time he said he discovered that his cellphone was missing and believed Santos had pawned it. The betrayal prompted him to plug Santos' name into a search engine where he found that Santos was wanted by Brazilian police.

""I would be scared to have someone like that in charge — having so much power in his hands"" Vilarva said. But this is the Republican/MAGA party we're talking about where telling lies has become an honored tradition.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIzLTAxLTAyL2luZGlhLXVuZW1wbG95bWVudC1yYXRlLXN1cmdlcy10by0xNi1tb250aC1oaWdoLWNtaWUtZGF0YS1zaG93c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,India Unemployment Rate Surges to 16-Month High CMIE Data Shows,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJsb29tYmVyZy5jb20vbmV3cy9hcnRpY2xlcy8yMDIzLTAxLTAyL2luZGlhLXVuZW1wbG95bWVudC1yYXRlLXN1cmdlcy10by0xNi1tb250aC1oaWdoLWNtaWUtZGF0YS1zaG93c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E4C7E320>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Jaime Bautista speaks at a briefing by the DOTr CAAP and MIAA on the glitch that shut down Philippine airspace on Jan. 1 2023.

Flight operations in Manila are expected to fully recover in three days but transport officials said billions of pesos' worth of upgrades are needed to prevent a repeat of the technical issues that effectively closed Philippine airspace to hundreds of flights on Sunday affecting thousands of passengers.

At least 282 flights were canceled diverted or delayed on New Year's Day as the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (CAAP) recorded a technical issue at the Philippine Air Traffic Management Center (ATMC) at 9:50 a.m. Some 56000 passengers were affected at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA).

According to flight tracker Flightradar24.com there were no flights in Philippine airspace at all for at least part of the day.

There are currently no airborne commercial flights in the Philippines (MANILA FIR). pic.twitter.com/xUhyPJarmE — Flightradar24 (@flightradar24) January 1 2023

In a press conference late Sunday CAAP Director General Manuel Tamayo said that one of the uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) failed on Sunday morning and troubleshooting activities had to be done.

Once the system was reconnected to the power supply however warnings were released at around lunch time due to over voltage as 380 volts were coming in instead of 220 volts. This then affected the very small aperture terminal (VSAT) which also had to be addressed.

""As what was mentioned medyo luma na 'to [It is quite old]. Like anything mechanical electrical we cannot give you any assurances [that it will not happen again]"" Tamayo said.

""What we have been doing in CAAP we budgeted P124 million to do some upgrades on the system and that is due this year 2023 for procurement... Hopefully this will help extend the life"" he added.

Tamayo said the CAAP will also do more frequent monitoring of the system which is already on a daily basis as this is the first time of such incident after the system was procured in 2018.

'We need a backup system'

The Department of Transportation (DOTr) said the system was partially restored as of 4 p.m. and flights have already resumed both arriving and departing.

“We really need to have a backup system na sana located in a different location. Hindi ‘yung malapit dito sa area where we have the existing system” Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista said in the same briefing.

“Of course we will need to have a budget for this so pag-aralan natin ‘to. We will do a feasibility study and present this to NEDA kasi napakaimportanteng system ito na dapat mayroon ang aviation sector ng Pilipinas” he added.

(We really need to have a backup that is hopefully in a different location not one nearby the area where we have the existing system. Of course we will need to have a budget for this so let us study. We will do a feasibility study and present this to NEDA because this is a very important system that the Philippine aviation sector needs.)

Bautista said the current system in use is already in its midlife as it was first introduced in 2010 but was officially implemented in 2018 when it cost P13 billion.

“Siguro [Maybe] we can still use it but we need to upgrade this to a better system so kung budget siguro it should be more than P13 billion now considering that we had this five years ago” he said.

The DOTr Secretary also said President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr. is aware of the situation and he has been briefed on the importance of the updates.

""We already presented this problem and sabi nga namin we really need to have this system. What happened today mapipilitan tayong madaliin 'yung paggawa or pagkakaroon ng backup system"" he said.

(We already presented this problem and we said that we really need to have this system. What happened today we will be forced to fast-track the acquisition of the backup system.)

Manila International Airport Authority (MIAA) General Manager Cesar Chiong said discussions have already been made with carriers for additional flights to be made to accommodate passengers affected by the outage.

“We’re expecting mga 72 hours po siguro for them to fully recover the flights” he said.

“We are also cognizant of the fact that most of the flights coming in or arriving in Metro Manila are going to be very full or pati ho ‘yung paalis so nakikipag-coordinate na ho kami sa kanilang lahat” he added.

(We’re expecting 72 hours for them to fully recover the flights. We are also cognizant of the fact that most of the flights coming in or arriving in Metro Manila are going to be very full or even those departing.)

Chiong said the runway of the NAIA— normally closed from 1:30 a.m. to 3:30 a.m. daily—will remain open 24/7 to accommodate additional flights.

""Ginagawa ng Manila International Airport tsaka ng CAAP in coordination with the other agencies tsaka DOTr provide 24/7 operations for these airlines for them to mount more flights and the sooner that they can mount more flights the better"" he said.

(The Manila International Airport and the CAAP in coordination with the other agencies and the DOTr is providing 24/7 operations for these airlines for them to mount more flights and the sooner that they can mount more flights the better.)

Food packs

In an earlier statement the DOTr said that it was ""on top"" of the situation and that it has ""directed different airline partners to provide food refreshments transportation lodging and accommodation for all affected passengers free of charge.""

It added that CAAP and MIAA have distributed Malasakit Kits and food packs to stranded passengers.

""DOTr also instructed the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) deployment of shuttle buses to take affected NAIA passengers to Clark International Airport"" it said.

'Horrendous'

In Jamie Santos' report on 24 Oras passengers lamented not just the cancelled flights but the costly repercussions for their travels.

“The airline said na puwede namang i-rebook for free pero siyempre ‘yung hotel is another issue. I’ll just deal with the other problems later” said Jenny Bayani who was scheduled to fly to Caticlan.

Business magnate Manny V. Pangilinan said his flight from Tokyo to Manila had to return to Haneda Airport more than halfway through the trip.

“[Six] hours of useless flying but inconvenience to travelers and losses to tourism and business are horrendous. Only in the PH. Sigh” he said in a tweet. — BM GMA Integrated News",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhhbnNpbmRpYS5jb20vbmV3cy9jaXRpZXMva2hhbW1hbS9zYml0LXNpZ25zLW1vdS13aXRoLWljdC1hY2FkZW15LTc3NTk4N9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhhbnNpbmRpYS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvY2l0aWVzL2toYW1tYW0vc2JpdC1zaWducy1tb3Utd2l0aC1pY3QtYWNhZGVteS03NzU5ODc?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,SBIT signs MoU with ICT Academy,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhhbnNpbmRpYS5jb20vbmV3cy9jaXRpZXMva2hhbW1hbS9zYml0LXNpZ25zLW1vdS13aXRoLWljdC1hY2FkZW15LTc3NTk4N9IBW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWhhbnNpbmRpYS5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvY2l0aWVzL2toYW1tYW0vc2JpdC1zaWducy1tb3Utd2l0aC1pY3QtYWNhZGVteS03NzU5ODc?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2EBFAC0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

This past year will likely go down as a turning point in the energy sector. After years of underperformance energy stocks soared in 2022. While higher energy prices played a key role an even more significant catalyst was energy security becoming a top priority for most countries following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The fallout of that ongoing conflict will likely have a major impact on the sector this year.

No one knows exactly how 2023 will play out. However I will try my luck by making a few bold predictions about what I believe we'll see in the oil patch in the coming year.

Oil prices top triple digits again

Last year I boldly predicted that oil prices would remain high and could top $100 a barrel again. With supplies still tight coming out of the pandemic and demand recovering the stage appeared set for a potential major spike in crude prices if there was a supply disruption. That's exactly what happened following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Another bull market is coming for oil in 2023. Supplies remain constrained because oil companies continue to be cautious about investing in expanding their output. In addition there's a lot of uncertainty about Russia's supply. It recently banned oil exports to countries that implemented a price cap on its oil in response to its ongoing war with Ukraine. Finally the U.S. has stopped drawing down its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).

Meanwhile on the demand side China appears poised to reopen its economy fully. There could be enormous pent-up demand from that country. While a global economic slowdown could affect demand the continuing return to normal following the pandemic could keep consumption elevated.

All these signs point to higher oil prices in 2023 with many Wall Street analysts expecting crude to top $100 by midyear. I agree.

Carbon capture will become one of the hottest investment trends in 2023

While climate change remains a top concern for global governments energy security has become an equally important priority. That's leading countries to seek out solutions to both problems. One that's emerging as a potential game changer is carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). The technology captures carbon dioxide and sequesters it underground. As a result it reduces the emissions profile of fossil fuels.

Oil companies believe CCS represents a multitrillion-dollar commercial opportunity. Because of that oil giants like Chevron (CVX 0.22%) Exxon (XOM -0.41%) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY -1.04%) are investing heavily in CCS technology and projects.

I believe 2023 will mark an inflection point for CCS. We'll see more countries and companies get on board with the idea that CCS can become a significant part of the solution to climate change. That should drive considerable investment in the sector. It should also buoy the stock prices of energy companies that are first movers in the space like Occidental Petroleum which has plans to develop 100 direct air capture facilities for CCS around the world in the coming years.

The next wave of LNG projects starts construction

Another fuel that can be a solution to the world's energy security and emissions problems is liquefied natural gas (LNG). Natural gas is abundant in certain parts of the world and has a lower emissions profile than oil and coal (it can even become net zero through CCS). Because of that it could become the key to solving Europe's energy crisis now that Russia has reduced its gas supplies to the continent.

According to ExxonMobil the fuel is in short supply. That's why we'll see several LNG export facilities reach positive final investment decisions in the coming year. There are many in the pipeline including projects supported by Energy Transfer (ET 0.17%) Devon Energy (DVN -1.44%) and ConocoPhillips (COP -0.57%). Energy Transfer has been working on its Lake Charles LNG project for years. The midstream company should finally approve that project in 2023 which could significantly boost its valuation and long-term growth outlook.

The oil industry's future will become clearer in 2023

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has dramatically altered the oil market's long-term outlook. Along with other catalysts that war will likely keep oil prices elevated in 2023. As a result energy security will remain a priority driving a new wave of LNG investments. CCS will also emerge as a viable long-term solution to extend the life of the fossil fuels sector. Given this outlook I expect oil stocks to do well again in 2023 especially those with CCS and LNG projects in the pipeline.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJhZGlvaGMuY3UvZW4vbm90aWNpYXMvbmFjaW9uYWxlcy8zMDkzOTItY29uc3RydWN0aW9uLXByb2plY3QtdG8tYmVuZWZpdC12aWN0aW1zLW9mLWlhbtIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Radio Havana Cuba | Construction Project to Benefit Victims of Ian,"Photo: Rafael Fernández. ACN.

Havana Jan 1 (RHC) A construction project that will benefit 40 families affected by Hurricane Ian which hit Vueltabajo on Sept. 27 is being undertaken in areas of the capital municipality of the Cuban province of Pinar del Río.

Two kilometers from the city of Vueltabajo on the road to La Coloma the houses that will replace what the storm took away from the people of Pinar del Río are being built.

Waldo Fuentes a member of the medium-sized company WFA Construction assured that the work is over 40 percent complete and is progressing according to plan.

He said that the first 18 dwellings will be completed in March and the rest later on.

The houses are structured according to the requirements of the so-called typology II which includes solid block and cement walls and a light roof he added.

Workers of Hydraulic Resources in the province at the same time are assessing the possibilities for the supply of drinking water to the future residents of that place; while an urbanization project to be carried out later is being planned.

Ian caused in the provincial capital some five thousand total landslides and considerable partial damages being the territory with greater affectation in the housing fund of Vueltabajo.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcnRlbmVyZ3kuY29tL3B1YmxpY2F0aW9ucy9zcGVjaWFsLXJlcG9ydHMvc2hhbGUtMjAyM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shale 2023 Special Report,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.hartenergy.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /publications/special-reports/shale-2023 (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E35DA860>, 'Connection to www.hartenergy.com timed out.

This finding challenges what astronomers know about some of the most powerful events in the universe.

The unusual cosmic explosion was detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift observatory on Dec. 11 2021 as the satellite orbited Earth. When astronomers pointed other telescopes at the part of the sky where this large blast of gamma rays – named GRB211211A – came from they saw a glow of visible and infrared light known as a kilonova. The particular wavelengths of light coming from this explosion allowed our team to identify the source of the unusual gamma-ray burst as two neutron stars colliding and merging together.

Gamma rays are the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation. In just a few seconds a gamma-ray burst blasts out the same amount of energy that the Sun will radiate throughout its entire life. Gamma-ray bursts are the most powerful events in the universe and astronomers think only two cosmic scenarios can produce gamma-ray bursts.

The most common sources are the deaths of stars 30 to 50 times more massive than the Sun. The catastrophic destruction of one these large stars is called a supernova. When they explode the stars create black holes that consume the leftover debris. These black holes emit a jet of matter and electromagnetic radiation that moves at close to the speed of light. In moments after the black hole starts emitting this high-energy stream of matter and radiation the jet produces a burst of gamma rays that can last for minutes.

The unusual gamma-ray burst originated from the small red dot within the circle in this image. The graph shows how bright and long-lasting the burst was. International Gemini Observatory/NOIRLab/NSF/AURA/M. Zamani/NASA/ESA/Eleonora Troja CC BY-ND

Kilonovae are the second type of events associated with gamma-ray bursts. Kilonovae occur when a neutron star merges with another neutron star or is consumed by a black hole. Neutron stars are rather small stars – about 1.4 to 2 times the mass of the Sun though only dozens of miles across.

When two of these tiny dense stars merge to produce a black hole they leave very little material behind. Compared with the long-lasting feast a black hole gets after a supernova kilonovae leave a black hole with little more than a snack that results in a gamma-ray burst that lasts only a second or two at most.

For over 20 years astronomers thought that kilonovae accompanied short gamma-ray bursts and supernovae accompanied long ones. So when our team started looking at the wealth of data and images collected on the minute-long burst in December 2021 we expected to see a supernova. Much to our surprise we found a kilonova.

Why it matters

Kilonovae are cosmic factories that create heavy metals including gold platinum iodine and uranium. Because they enrich the chemical composition of the universe kilonovae are critical to providing the basic ingredients for the formation of planets and life.

GRB211211A's long duration contradicts existing theories of how gamma-ray bursts relate to supernovae and kilonovae. This finding shows that there is still a lot astronomers like us don't understand about these powerful and important processes and suggests that there may be other ways the universe can produce heavy metals.

Kilonovae are responsible for producing heavy metals – like gold uranium and iodine – that are important for many processes in the universe.

What still isn't known

The initial images and data gathered on this interesting event look like a kilonova produced from the collision of two neutron stars. But the long-lasting burst of gamma rays throws doubt on what exactly happened. It is possible that one of the players was a rare neutron star with an incredibly powerful magnetic field – called a magnetar. The burst could also have been the result of a neutron star being torn apart by its companion black hole. Or astronomers could have just witnessed a new previously unknown type of stellar crash.

What's next

The few exotic stellar encounters that produce gamma-ray bursts can look very similar to one another across the electromagnetic spectrum. However the unique gravitational wave signatures they produce could be the key to solving the enigma. The gravitational wave detectors LIGO Virgo and KAGRA did not see GRB211211A as they were all offline for improvements. If they can catch a long-duration gamma-ray burst after they begin operating again in 2023 the combination of gravitational wave and electromagnetic data may solve the mystery of this newly discovered event.

This Mustang is unlike any other that we’ve come across. While it looks pretty much like any other Mustang of this era from the rear and sides it has the front fascia and hood of a Chevrolet Camaro. It includes the same grille and air intakes as a Camaro and while the headlights appear to be aftermarket units they too are very similar to those of a Camaro you could buy from a Chevy dealership.

The Ford has been listed through Copart as having sustained damage to the front end. These images show that the upper part of the front grille is missing and that damage has been done to the front bumper and hood. Other than the front end however the car doesn’t appear to have suffered too much damage and the listing confirms that it still runs and drives.

It is not just the Camaro fascia that makes this Mustang stand out. The previous owner of it has also kitted it out with the interior of a Camaro complete with the same instrument cluster as Chevy’s muscle car and even a Chevrolet MyLink infotainment system.

Copart says the car has an estimated retail value of $25000 but due to the modifications it has undergone we don’t think it is actually worth that much. Repairing it to its ‘former glory’ will require sourcing new front-end components but shouldn’t be too expensive as it seems the fascia has aftermarket parts rather than a genuine Chevrolet bumper grille and lights."

Costco memberships

The Gold Star membership costs $60 per year and it includes one card per household and gives you access to all clubs worldwide and Costco online.

The Business membership is similar to the Gold Star as it's the same price but the difference is users can add Affiliate Cardholders for $60 each.

The Executive membership costs $120 and the main difference is you can earn two percent back on all qualifying purchases and save on vacations booked through Costco Travel as well as other Costco Select services.

Other ways to save at Costco

Costco gives members various kinds of discounts and perks including discounted gas prices extended warranties and savings on prescriptions.

Plus you don't have to be a member to receive membership pricing.

Non-members can also shop at Costco.com as the site is open to all.

Just be aware that you will pay a five percent surcharge and many items are usually marked up an extra five percent to 20 percent higher than what's offered in-store for its members.

Some products will also be marked as member-only items and aren’t available to non-members.

But even with those rules shopping online might still be cheaper especially if you check its featured deals before checking out.

Plus the wholesaler is known for saving shoppers at least 15 percent on different restaurants or movie tickets when you buy gift cards at its store.

It offers gift cards for steakhouses and other fine dining BBQ burger joints coffee shops ice cream parlors streaming subscriptions and even gift cards for the spa.

You can also get around a 20 percent to 40 percent discount on an LA Fitness membership if you purchase it through Costco.

The Sun reveals how Costco shoppers can save hundreds of dollars using a grocery hack.

Schneider’s intermodal operations on Union Pacific transitioned seamlessly as the companies collaborated closely over the last year to align operations technology sales and customer teams in preparation for the service change. There was no disruption to Schneider’s customers during the transition. The move is also a pivotal step in the carrier’s plans to double its intermodal size by 2030 and continue to reduce its carbon footprint.

The supply chain leader has one of the largest intermodal fleets in North America including more than 28000 company-owned containers which accompany a fully deployed company-owned chassis fleet. Schneider now has access to more rail lanes as well as direct connections on transcontinental freight due to the partnership between the Union Pacific and CSX networks.

“ We believe the move in the West means we can offer our customers a distinct differentiator in the market” said Schneider Executive Vice President and Group President of Transportation and Logistics Jim Filter. “ The combination of more coast-to-coast connections and being the first fully asset-based carrier with company drivers company-owned containers and company-owned chassis to operate on the railroad will result in more consistent service and less time in transit. We see huge benefits with Union Pacific to successfully deliver a positive service experience for our customers and drivers.”

Schneider and Union Pacific are working collectively to improve driver efficiency at terminals further reducing delays in transit. The railroad’s additional lane options and consistent rail departure frequency provides customers with more options better reliability and ultimately greater control over the supply chain.

“ This is the beginning of a partnership built on a shared commitment to provide more sustainable intermodal services and reduce our carbon footprints” said Union Pacific Executive Vice President of Marketing and Sales Kenny Rocker. “ We look forward to future growth as we leverage Union Pacific’s extensive network and Schneider’s innovative logistics offerings to provide unparalleled customer service.”

“ In addition to offering our customers more possibilities the transition to Union Pacific is a crucial piece in furthering our sustainability goals” said Filter.

Moving freight by rail has significant environmental benefits. One ton of freight can be moved 500 miles by rail on the equivalent of a single gallon of fuel. Working with Union Pacific provides a reduction in idling time and increased route optimization that leads to a cut in vehicle emissions. Additionally Schneider announced in 2022 that it would be adding 92 battery electric vehicles to its intermodal operations in southern California giving customers even more ways to cut emissions.

Many were curious about how “The King” would fare against elite fighters when grappling is suddenly mixed with striking.

But as the 27-year-old continues to rack up wins in submission grappling his MMA future is looking bleak. As he told Ariel Helwani in a recent episode of the MMA Hour part of his decision is also influenced by his longtime mentor John Danaher.

“John [Danaher] has never been wrong our coach has never been wrong about anything. He’s never been wrong.

“He’s told me things and whether it be five years or three years or seven years later he always ends up being right and John is like ‘Absolutely do not go into MMA. You already make a ton of money doing this you’re considered the greatest of all time already and jiu-jitsu is about to become mainstream and once it becomes mainstream everyone is going to get paid more and jiu-jitsu is going to be a real sport. You’re at the forefront of that and if you move to MMA now that could be lost.’

“So I don’t know. Maybe if one of the other guys from the team wins an ADCC Absolute or something.

While he isn’t closing his doors Ryan says he’d rather focus on what he feels is his obligation to “push jiu-jitsu” into further mainstream recognition.

“I’ve always wanted to fight MMA but I’m in such a good position now and I feel like it’s kind of my job to push jiu-jitsu over the hump into the mainstream. So I’m not totally ruling it out but I’m pretty comfortable with just grappling right now.

“I’m like the Mayweather or McGregor of jiu-jitsu. I don’t make nearly as much money as them but in proportion to the rest of the guys. But my goal in the next five to 10 years is to have athletes at least with purses — most of my money comes from instructionals.

“Most of my jiu-jitsu money comes from instructional videos so I don’t think anyone is going to make as much money teaching as I do because I think I’m a much better teacher but I do think that in the next five to 10 years athletes could be making similar money to what I’m making now just through competition purses.

“I think that an athlete in jiu-jitsu in the next five to 10 years should be making over $1 million a year just competing. And if we can do that I think we’ll have something going for us.”

Ryan who hasn’t lost since 2018 is set for a Nogi superfight against fellow ADCC champion Felipe Pena.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Future of Food No matter what separates us we all have at least one thing in common — we all eat.

Agweek and our partners at Forum Communications Company are thinking about the Future of Food. This reporting series looks at the techniques and technologies that are advancing agriculture and the science around our foods and food production.









Above the traditional Corn Belt John Deere scientists and engineers in Fargo are at the forefront of the company’s ambitious “electrification” strategies. Some 700 people work among four buildings several blocks apart. It’s called the ""Intelligent Solutions Group.”

The company has its Power Electric Systems (PES) building and a few blocks away a “main plant” a “logistics” building and a “new product introduction” building (the one prominently seen from the Fargodome in North Dakota State University’s Research Park).

Why Fargo?

In the 1990s John Deere was a customer of the former Phoenix International. Phoenix was created in 1987 by former employees from Fargo-based Steiger Tractor Co. Steiger filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1986. Later that year Steiger was swallowed by Tenneco/Case-IH (now CNH Industrial).

Led by visionaries including Barry Batcheller Phoenix made electronics — farm tractor hitch controls and dashboard electronics. John Deere fully acquired Phoenix in 1999 but continued the Phoenix name until about 2014.

John Deere’s Power Electronic Systems Building is brimming with activity Dec. 6 2022 in Fargo North Dakota. The space includes a “flexible” final assembly line where employees put together a variety of products including motor drives. They might include circuit board assemblies made in another John Deere building in town and their components may go into kits assembled at yet another building. Mikkel Pates / Agweek

The Fargo employees specialize in electronics-related products — especially power “electrification” products.

This “electrification” is part of John Deere’s big “Leap Ambitions” announced early in 2022.

Among its goals: By 2030 they expect to help their farmer-clients do many things — improve nitrogen efficiency by 20% increase crop protection efficiency by 20% and reduce customer carbon dioxide emissions by 15%.

‘Leap Ambition’

Kent Wanner a senior staff electrification application design engineer the latest of five prestigious “Fellow” recipients recently gave Agweek a tour of John Deere’s PES Building.

John Deere has 75000 employees. It has 30 “fellows” recognized for their excellence and five of them who work in Fargo North Dakota gathered there on Dec. 6 2022. They are (from left): Noel Anderson (2019) Long Wu (2018) Kent Wanner (2022) Brij Singh (2020) and Will Cooper (2021). Mikkel Pates / Agweek

It is the “design center” for electrification products for all of John Deere nationally (and globally). He is one of the elite “fellows” and received this designation in 2022.

The PES building was constructed in 2012 for $22 million and includes 90000 square-feet of work space.

Wanner explained that engineers of all descriptions work here — software hardware mechanical and manufacturing engineers. These minds work on equipment solutions that may be — will be — commercialized. But they can’t be talked about — yet.

The ideas for inventions come from everywhere — customers and dealers to name a few. Engineers turn them into engine controllers transmission controllers displays GPS receivers sensors wireless communications telematic devices and more. Often they can reuse components and ideas from previous components and applications. All of these products and technologies are considered part of John Deere’s “Technology Stack” available for use on one or more machines.

Before a new idea is made into something physical engineers and technicians test them virtually. Long Wu with a doctorate in electrical engineering/power electronics leads a group that vets the design before it becomes a physical prototype. Some of the products start by studying Deere’s hardware embedded software connectivity data platforms and applications from previous products.

He leads a group of scientists who create and test software and control algorithms including testing product concepts virtually before they are made into physical prototypes. Mikkel Pates / Agweek

Once passing the virtual test the component is built along with a movable “tester” — large black metal cabinets that move about the building where the product undergoes a gauntlet of tests.

The employees then subject them to every kind of trauma. They fix them to large shaking tables simulating effects of running on tracks or wheels.

They put them in a saltwater fog. They dunk them one meter in saltwater.

They use high-power sprays.

They expose them to short-circuits improper jump-starting reverse polarity. They simulate the effects of driving under a high-voltage power line.

They see how the components behave at temperature extremes — minus 40 degrees Fahrenheit to plus 185.

The lab is equipped with two “anechoic” (free from echo) chambers — large metal rooms within the larger lab with special metal exterior and welds and seams ensuring no electromagnetic waves can get in or out. They hit the products with electromagnetic waves over a wide range of frequencies.

“We don’t want to emit too much energy to corrupt wireless communications or to be susceptible to external electromagnetic energy” either Wanner said.

Engineer Kent Wanner of John Deere says engineers and technicians make sure products are rugged. In this “anechoic” (free from echo) chamber they guarantee proper electronics product operation while being bombarded with electromagnetic waves and also make sure the products don’t emit waves that could corrupt nearby communications radios or other equipment.

Once the products get the go-ahead they are built at a “main plant” a few blocks away. Some go into assembly kits and are shipped elsewhere.

Once products are tested the “product testers” (cabinets) are kept as long as the product is in service in case it needs to be “requalified” or requires a design change in its life cycle.

Finished assembled parts can go to a “logistics building” where other fellow employees put them in “install kits.”

Besides using electronics in its own products Deere sells them to non-competing non-ag companies that use “electrification” (ie. hybrid or battery electric trucks buses). Some companies will test their own vehicle controllers in the Fargo lab.

Futuristic but real

Deere’s inventions in Fargo seem futuristic but some are already in the marketplace. ""This is real"" Wanner said.

One of the best examples is a pair of “hybrid” four-wheel-drive construction loaders released in 2013 and 2015. Hybrid means they use two sources of energy — diesel fuel and “kinetic” energy or energy created from moving the vehicle back into useful work. They do this by tying electric motors and generators into the drive train.

“Imagine there’s a motor driving the transmission” Wanner said. “When we want to slow down and lift a bucket that’s full and dump it into a crusher or truck that slowing down normally gets burned up in the brakes as heat. With this electrified drive train we can use the motor to slow us down and act as a generator — creating energy that can be effectively used to spin the hydraulic pump or an engine cooling fan. Electrification of the drive train on large machinery has been shown to cut fuel use by 25% or more.""

The principles go beyond “traction” vehicles.

Fargo engineers were instrumental in creating the ExactEmerge planter system — one of the company’s most successful models. Released in 2014 ExactEmerge uses “electrification” to control planting at high speeds. This puts two electric motors and controllers per row of a planter.

“One of them meters out the number of seeds per second that you want to put in that row” Wanner said. “The other matches the speed of that row as it travels down the field. With electrification we now let the second motor match the ground speed and in fact accelerates the seed in the opposite direction that the planter is going. So if you’re going 5 mph and it accelerate the seed at minus 5 mph … the seed just drops and it doesn’t roll.""

So instead of planting at 5 mph the farmer can plant at 10 mph with exactitude. This gets twice as many acres planted. The concept has special benefits when a 48-row wide planter turns a corner: The outside goes faster than the inside row.

“The electronics can now have different rows matching the speed still maintaining very good spacing” Wanner said.

Among the tests for products at John Deere are power-washing and water immersion vats. Kent Wanner a senior engineer in Fargo North Dakota said testing this ensures that new John Deere electronics products will be robust in the field. Photo taken Dec. 6 2022 Fargo North Dakota.

What’s ahead?

Some principles will have a role in improving “autonomy” in machines.

Oh yes and their scientists are developing machines that can study and interpret “fluorescence” emitted from growing plants genetically designed for the purpose of emitting data about crop stress. The fluorescence is invisible to the naked eye but visible from high altitude and space.

Electrification won’t eliminate diesel any time soon Wanner said but it often allows the machine to use a much smaller diesel engine than otherwise necessary saving fuel and money.

The customer benefit is lower fuel use — a big issue at times of high fuel prices.

Wanner said that eventually the cost of electrification should come down creating new value and enabling more applications for farmers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9xY3RpbWVzL25hbWUvZGF2aWQtc2NoYWZlci1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zODcxOTUzNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,David Schafer Obituary (2023) - Davenport IA - Quad-City Times,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/qctimes/name/david-schafer-obituary?id=38719535 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9xY3RpbWVzL25hbWUvZGF2aWQtc2NoYWZlci1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zODcxOTUzNdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFncmlsYW5kLmllL2Zhcm1pbmctbmV3cy9oZW5yeS1kcmV5ZnVzcy1yZXZvbHV0aW9uYXJ5LWRlc2lnbi13b3JrLWZvci1kZWVyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Henry Dreyfuss' revolutionary design work for Deere,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmFncmlsYW5kLmllL2Zhcm1pbmctbmV3cy9oZW5yeS1kcmV5ZnVzcy1yZXZvbHV0aW9uYXJ5LWRlc2lnbi13b3JrLWZvci1kZWVyZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E5746860>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The gate agent offered them $8000 apiece – $24000 in total – to take another flight. They felt like they’d won the lottery. But then Delta reneged on the offer. The family didn’t get the vouchers and they didn’t get to take the flight.

Instead Delta wound up cancelling the flight because of a missing crewmember. As a result they no longer ‘needed the family’s seats’ in order to accommodate other passengers since nobody was going to be accommodated. By cancelling the flight Delta didn’t have to pay denied boarding compensation at all.

A Bay Area tourist was offered $24000 worth of vouchers from Delta Airlines to give up his family’s seats on an overbooked flight. But he says the airline took back the offer made after an alleged staffing mishap. “I understand that flights cancel and things happen” said David Reeves a Nashville native visiting San Francisco for the holidays. “But don’t dangle the carrot and pull it back.”

The flight was on Christmas Eve day and the family was connecting to Nashville. The man’s family said he was ruining Christmas by taking the bump vouchers. But in his words “its $24000… we can wait a day for $8000 a seat.”

In the end they didn’t get the voucher and didn’t make it on Christmas Eve but they did make it for Christmas. Delta offered a flight two days later the day after Christmas. However they took matters into their own hands and drove to Monterey airport where they picked up a flight. Delta covered a night’s hotel and rental car expense.

Imagine being so close to $24000 in travel vouchers not getting the money but not getting the flight either. You get hosed by the airline anyway and still don’t get the future travel they offered.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbG9mZnBhdGguY29tL3RoaXMtaXMtdGhlLWFpcmxpbmUtd2l0aC10aGUtbGVhc3QtZGVsYXlzLWluLXRoZS11LXMtcmlnaHQtbm93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,This Is The Airline With The Least Delays In The U.S. Right Now,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRyYXZlbG9mZnBhdGguY29tL3RoaXMtaXMtdGhlLWFpcmxpbmUtd2l0aC10aGUtbGVhc3QtZGVsYXlzLWluLXRoZS11LXMtcmlnaHQtbm93L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3860E80>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

This past year will likely go down as a turning point in the energy sector. After years of underperformance energy stocks soared in 2022. While higher energy prices played a key role an even more significant catalyst was energy security becoming a top priority for most countries following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The fallout of that ongoing conflict will likely have a major impact on the sector this year.

No one knows exactly how 2023 will play out. However I will try my luck by making a few bold predictions about what I believe we'll see in the oil patch in the coming year.

Oil prices top triple digits again

Last year I boldly predicted that oil prices would remain high and could top $100 a barrel again. With supplies still tight coming out of the pandemic and demand recovering the stage appeared set for a potential major spike in crude prices if there was a supply disruption. That's exactly what happened following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Another bull market is coming for oil in 2023. Supplies remain constrained because oil companies continue to be cautious about investing in expanding their output. In addition there's a lot of uncertainty about Russia's supply. It recently banned oil exports to countries that implemented a price cap on its oil in response to its ongoing war with Ukraine. Finally the U.S. has stopped drawing down its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).

Meanwhile on the demand side China appears poised to reopen its economy fully. There could be enormous pent-up demand from that country. While a global economic slowdown could affect demand the continuing return to normal following the pandemic could keep consumption elevated.

All these signs point to higher oil prices in 2023 with many Wall Street analysts expecting crude to top $100 by midyear. I agree.

Carbon capture will become one of the hottest investment trends in 2023

While climate change remains a top concern for global governments energy security has become an equally important priority. That's leading countries to seek out solutions to both problems. One that's emerging as a potential game changer is carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). The technology captures carbon dioxide and sequesters it underground. As a result it reduces the emissions profile of fossil fuels.

Oil companies believe CCS represents a multitrillion-dollar commercial opportunity. Because of that oil giants like Chevron (CVX 0.22%) Exxon (XOM -0.41%) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY -1.04%) are investing heavily in CCS technology and projects.

I believe 2023 will mark an inflection point for CCS. We'll see more countries and companies get on board with the idea that CCS can become a significant part of the solution to climate change. That should drive considerable investment in the sector. It should also buoy the stock prices of energy companies that are first movers in the space like Occidental Petroleum which has plans to develop 100 direct air capture facilities for CCS around the world in the coming years.

The next wave of LNG projects starts construction

Another fuel that can be a solution to the world's energy security and emissions problems is liquefied natural gas (LNG). Natural gas is abundant in certain parts of the world and has a lower emissions profile than oil and coal (it can even become net zero through CCS). Because of that it could become the key to solving Europe's energy crisis now that Russia has reduced its gas supplies to the continent.

According to ExxonMobil the fuel is in short supply. That's why we'll see several LNG export facilities reach positive final investment decisions in the coming year. There are many in the pipeline including projects supported by Energy Transfer (ET 0.17%) Devon Energy (DVN -1.44%) and ConocoPhillips (COP -0.57%). Energy Transfer has been working on its Lake Charles LNG project for years. The midstream company should finally approve that project in 2023 which could significantly boost its valuation and long-term growth outlook.

The oil industry's future will become clearer in 2023

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has dramatically altered the oil market's long-term outlook. Along with other catalysts that war will likely keep oil prices elevated in 2023. As a result energy security will remain a priority driving a new wave of LNG investments. CCS will also emerge as a viable long-term solution to extend the life of the fossil fuels sector. Given this outlook I expect oil stocks to do well again in 2023 especially those with CCS and LNG projects in the pipeline.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vMTU5LjIwMy4xNDQuOTgvYnVzaW5lc3MtZWNvbm9teS8yMDIzLzAxLzIwMjItcmVjYXAtZXhlY3V0aXZlLXJldGlyZW1lbnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 Recap: Executive Retirements,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='159.203.144.98', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /business-economy/2023/01/2022-recap-executive-retirements/ (Caused by SSLError(CertificateError(""hostname '159.203.144.98' doesn't match either of 'dmagazine.com', 'www.dmagazine.com'""))) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUWh0dHBzOi8vMTU5LjIwMy4xNDQuOTgvYnVzaW5lc3MtZWNvbm9teS8yMDIzLzAxLzIwMjItcmVjYXAtZXhlY3V0aXZlLXJldGlyZW1lbnRzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9ub3J0aC9hcmNpdGMtb2Zmc2hvcmUtZHJpbGxpbmctcmVzdHJpY3Rpb25zLWV4dGVuZGluZy0xLjY2OTk4MzPSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuNjY5OTgzMw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Feds extend restrictions on Arctic offshore drilling,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNiYy5jYS9uZXdzL2NhbmFkYS9ub3J0aC9hcmNpdGMtb2Zmc2hvcmUtZHJpbGxpbmctcmVzdHJpY3Rpb25zLWV4dGVuZGluZy0xLjY2OTk4MzPSASBodHRwczovL3d3dy5jYmMuY2EvYW1wLzEuNjY5OTgzMw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E4CABAF0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Do you remember CyrusOne CoreSite Realty and QTS Realty Trust? Well between 2021 and 2022 they were taken private by KKR (NYSE: KKR) American Tower (NYSE: AMT) and affiliates of Blackstone (NYSE: BX) respectively. Currently only two data center REITs remain publicly listed – Equinix Inc. (NASDAQ: EQIX) and Digital Realty (NYSE: DLR). There’s also DigitalBridge (NYSE: DBRG) but due to its small size I’ve left it aside. Out of EQIX and DLR the latter looks like the better pick and I’ll discuss why in this piece.

Could Equinix and Digital Realty be taken private as well? I don’t think so. With market caps of $60.6 billion and $29.4 billion respectively they are likely too large for anybody to take them private in the current illiquid market environment. Nevertheless the lofty interest in their (now privately-held) competitors by asset management firms should affirm that data center REITs remain highly-attractive assets.

Why are EQIX and DLR High-Quality Investments?

Growing Dependence on Data Centers

Data Center REITs have become increasingly attractive due to the rising dependence on data and the internet for a broad range of activities. These catalysts are driving demand for data centers which are critical for storing processing and managing large amounts of data.

This trend is likely to continue in the future as cloud computing and other technology solutions that require data storage and processing become increasingly needed. Further due to their role in the operation of many other critical infrastructure systems such as transportation energy healthcare and telecommunications REITs in the space face limited risks in terms of experiencing lower occupancy rates during unfavorable economic periods. A company is more likely to shut its headquarters office first before considering dumping its access to its data centers where all of its critical data is stored.

Stable Cash Flows

Data center REITs know how essential their properties are to their customers which provides them with enough leverage to negotiate long-term tenancy contracts. For context Equinix features a weighted-average remaining lease term of 14 years while Digital Realty’s equivalent metric stands at five years.

Through such long-term contracts with their customers data center REITs enjoy a stable source of cash flows. This makes data centers much more attractive assets than retail commercial or residential properties in that regard. Predictable cash flows also help to mitigate the impact of economic downturns which should ensure data center REITs remain resilient during a potential recession even if their growth rates slow down.

Diversified Cash Flows High Scalability

Data center REITs generate cash flows from several sources such as colocation managed hosting and cloud services. Simultaneously each data center can host multiple tenants. For instance Digital Realty’s multi-tenant data center capacity features more than 170000 cross-connects in critical locations despite owning just over 300 data centers. Diversification through multiple services and customers means that risk is reduced and scalability improves.

Another noteworthy point regarding the scalability of data centers is that most are designed in a modular fashion meaning that they can be easily extended by adding extra components. For instance a data center REIT could add new servers or storage systems to its properties to meet the requirements of its customers with little incremental effort.

Is EQIX Stock a Buy According to Analysts?

Regarding Wall Street’s view on Equinix the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys and five Holds assigned in the past three months. At $746.61 the average Equinix stock price target suggests 14% upside potential.

Is DLR Stock a Buy According to Analysts?

Analysts forecast even stronger upside potential on Digital Realty with the stock having a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on six Buys five Holds and one Sell assigned in the past three months. At $119.25 the average Digital Realty stock price target implies 18.9% upside potential.

Takeaway – DLR Stock is Likely the Better Pick

With uncertainty likely to persist in the markets in 2023 investors can benefit from the inherent qualities we just discussed that come attached to EQIX stock and DLR stock. Not only are they set to keep producing robust cash flows in the face of increased uncertainty but being REITs investors should also continue enjoying robust dividends. That said I believe that DLR stock offers a more compelling investment case.

The stock yields a substantial 4.9% and trades at a reasonable forward price/FFO ratio of about 15x based on forecasts for Fiscal 2022 (FFO = funds from operations an earnings metric used by REITs). This should translate into a solid margin of safety if valuations were to be compressed further through the year. The same cannot be said for EQIX stock which trades at a price/FFO ratio of 32x and yields just 1.9%.

Why is the market willing to pay double the price for EQIX stock? I believe this is because the company’s enormous scale is likely to allow for multiple synergies across data centers in the coming years which is likely to lead to better FFO/share growth. Additionally EQIX leases are significantly longer than those of DLR.

Nevertheless paying this much these days especially with interest rates on the rise which can have a major impact on REITs is too risky in my view. DLR’s higher tangible returns and fairer valuation are likely to outperform EQIX if tension among REITs persists.

Real estate has been going through a seismic shift over the last few years. Compared to other industries real estate sector adopted digital technology much later. The age-old real estate industry is beginning to embrace digital disruption in marketing and other areas as technology helps the real estate sector stay relevant in the digital age.

Here are the key factors that nudged the industry into a digital awakening.

Internet penetration

According to Statista the UAE’s rate of internet penetration is a staggering 99 per cent which makes it the second-most connected country in the world. The average daily time spent by individuals across all devices is a whopping 8 hours 36 minutes. If most of your audience is present online for the better part of the day you have to be there to meet them halfway. Offline marketing and other traditional marketing have now shifted to facilitate brand recall and image building while online platforms are now steering sales and marketing campaigns from the forefront.

The emergence of proptech

Proptech – an acronym for property technology – refers to the use of technology for operations sales and marketing in the real estate space through tools such as virtual reality online listings automated payments and more. Proptech enables real estate companies to take informed and data-backed decisions optimise business operations manage sales pipelines and plan marketing campaigns all from a unified single platform. Proptech and digital marketing solutions have brought about an era where real estate is seamlessly accessible to all stakeholders from developers to buyers. Companies that do not embrace this change now will have to spend more resources to catch up with the competitors.

User experience is definitely king

‘Experience’ is the buzzword or the holy grail when it comes to marketing and selling. From a website to a sales center conversion depends on how seamless the user experience is. Just having a website does not work anymore. Your website is your asset and your brand’s digital avatar. In most cases it is the first point of contact for your audience. The real estate industry is waking up to this truth and has joined the bandwagon. Developing a viable online marketing strategy complete with a cohesive user experience across all the customer touchpoints will allow realtors to reach out to their target audience effectively.

Target audience: millennials

Since 2010 millennials have consistently been the main group of home buyers and this trend is expected to continue and spill over to Gen Y and Gen Z in the next few years. Millennials depend on the internet for everything They begin their research on properties before actually reaching out to an agent or a broker unlike previous generations. This makes having a professional and influential digital presence imperative.

Rise of web3 and blockchain technology

Three major disruptive innovations that changed the way the real estate industry functions are blockchain technology augmented reality and AI-enabled data integration platforms. Currently there are transactions being processed in cryptocurrencies in the real estate space and virtual real estate investing in the metaverse is also rising. Real estate marketers have to explore these technologies to be future ready. Even though the real estate industry heavily relies on the human element it will be wise to understand how these disruptive changes will come about and what they will be.

Digital disruption

The pandemic revolutionised the modus operandi for the real estate sector and pushed businesses to think outside the box. As a result there have been a spectacular shift from real to virtual in the real estate industry. The availability of real-time market data changes in customer behavior and advancements in augmented reality virtual reality (AR/VR) technology have hastened this field’s development. Demand for online shopping and virtual house tours is at an all-time high. 3D renders and virtual walk-throughs have become normal now for most real estate companies. As of today the UAE real estate market has recorded AED 204.5 bn worth of sales – it is a massive 77.8 per cent higher than the last year even though property prices are at an all-time high. The digital transformation that took place in the industry has played a big role to play in these pathbreaking sales figures.

To wrap it up real estate marketers must continue to be agile and open-minded in their marketing efforts. Technology has seeped into every aspect of our daily lives. However we connect with brands for the values they represent and the stories they tell. Your branding should reflect this in the digital world while embracing the latest technologies to remain in step with your target audience.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvc2VydmljZXMvcHJvcGVydHktLy1jc3RydWN0aW9uL2RpZ2l0YWwtZWRnZS1zZXQtZm9yLWluZGlhLWZvcmF5LXRvLWJ1eS00Ny1hY3JlLXRoYW5lLXBsb3QtZm9yLW1haWRlbi1kYXRhLWNlbnRlci9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjY5MDI4NS5jbXPSAbIBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L3NlcnZpY2VzL3Byb3BlcnR5LS8tY3N0cnVjdGlvbi9kaWdpdGFsLWVkZ2Utc2V0LWZvci1pbmRpYS1mb3JheS10by1idXktNDctYWNyZS10aGFuZS1wbG90LWZvci1tYWlkZW4tZGF0YS1jZW50ZXIvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2NjkwMjg1LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Digital Edge set for India foray to buy 47-acre Thane plot for maiden data center,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMirgFodHRwczovL20uZWNvbm9taWN0aW1lcy5jb20vaW5kdXN0cnkvc2VydmljZXMvcHJvcGVydHktLy1jc3RydWN0aW9uL2RpZ2l0YWwtZWRnZS1zZXQtZm9yLWluZGlhLWZvcmF5LXRvLWJ1eS00Ny1hY3JlLXRoYW5lLXBsb3QtZm9yLW1haWRlbi1kYXRhLWNlbnRlci9hcnRpY2xlc2hvdy85NjY5MDI4NS5jbXPSAbIBaHR0cHM6Ly9tLmVjb25vbWljdGltZXMuY29tL2luZHVzdHJ5L3NlcnZpY2VzL3Byb3BlcnR5LS8tY3N0cnVjdGlvbi9kaWdpdGFsLWVkZ2Utc2V0LWZvci1pbmRpYS1mb3JheS10by1idXktNDctYWNyZS10aGFuZS1wbG90LWZvci1tYWlkZW4tZGF0YS1jZW50ZXIvYW1wX2FydGljbGVzaG93Lzk2NjkwMjg1LmNtcw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3E7E140>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

From marvelling at the red rocks of Petra to floating in the high-salinity Dead Sea camping out in the desert valley of Wadi Rum or observing Roman Byzantine and Arabic ruins in Amman there is an incredible amount to see and do. But today’s travellers want to delve deeper into a destination’s DNA to enjoy more authentic experiences and to get to know the people at the heart of a country. In particular people who might more often be overlooked but whose contribution to tourism is paramount. In 2018 Jordan in partnership with the charity Tourism Cares launched the first ever Meaningful Travel Map of the country encompassing twelve different social enterprises many of which put women at their front and centre and offer enriching and hands-on cultural experiences to the more curious and enlightened traveller as well as providing the women with jobs and an income. The twelve enterprises highlighted are powerful and positive for both visitors who want to use the power of travel to help people and places thrive and for local communities who benefit long after the last guest has gone back to their home country as each of the experiences operates a programme for directly benefiting the disadvantaged. Derek Hydon chairman of the Tourism Cares board of directors said: ""The very act of travel can be a force for good and these experiences are really about connecting people: travellers who are exploring Jordan and the dynamic local leaders who are moving these communities forward."" So where should you start? The offerings at the twelve social enterprises vary and are scattered along a route which runs from north to south alongside the Dead Sea and the wadis which bookend it. Near Petra for example is the Ammarin Bedouin Camp hidden within a spectacular amphitheatre of sand and hills and run by the local Ammarin tribe. Guests can camp out overnight and enjoy dinner knowing they are contributing to a lesser-known community which is often overlooked in favour of that based in Petra itself.

Those which really highlight women’s contributions include the Iraq Al Amir Women’s Cooperative. Founded by the Noor Al-Hussein Foundation over two decades ago it aims to make women financially independent and to raise their standards of living by increasing their income and preserving local heritage. As well as selling hand-made ceramics fabrics and gifts this women’s cooperative offers cooking classes and paper-making workshops. Here you can learn anything from how to make local dishes including magloubet zahra (‘upside-down’ cauliflower) to how herbs and spices are used to dye artisan paper. Initially the women involved were solely occupied in the production of local crafts; as well as hand-made paper they created hand-woven fabrics and ceramics. They have since been given extensive training in finance and admin product design quality control and marketing which has ultimately led the women in the cooperative to take complete ownership of the project. Not far from the shores of the Dead Sea and just over an hour’s drive south from Amman you’ll find the Bani Hamida Women’s Weaving Project supported by the Jordan River Foundation. This pioneering weaving project has changed the lives of over 1650 local women empowering them with new skills and financial independence. You’ll meet the weavers themselves with the opportunity to buy carpets baskets and food directly from the women who made them. The centre is located in a charming one-story home surrounded by a spacious garden. Visitors are welcomed by the women weavers who are keen to show them their beautiful wool products share their stories with them and provide them with the opportunity to have a hands-on experience themselves – using the weaving machines and possibly even weaving their own carpet or basket.

UPPER SANDUSKY Ohio — A man is charged with murder after he allegedly attacked a dollar store employee with a machete in northwest Ohio Sunday afternoon.

Officers with the Upper Sandusky Police Department were called to the Dollar Tree at 1120 East Wyandot Avenue for a report of a man waiving a machete around inside the store.

Officers arrived at the store and found 22-year-old Keris Riebel dead at the scene. The man who police identified as 27-year-old Bethel Bekele left the store before police arrived.

One of the officers found the suspect a short time later on South Fifth Street and arrested him.

Investigators learned Bekele entered the store with the machete and struck Riebel multiple times. The weapon was found at the scene.

Police said the motive behind the fatal machete attack is unclear. Detectives are looking into whether Riebel and Bekele knew each other. Upper Sandusky Municipal Court documents say the attack was random and unprovoked.

10TV spoke with the victim’s family who said they are devastated by the loss of Riebel. They say she was a newlywed and describe her as ""an amazing kind and sweet young woman who lit up the world with her smile.”

Residents of the tight-knit community say they are horrified by this loss.

""It's like terrifying to see something like this in Upper Sandusky because this is a nice community” said resident Jason Pierce.

The Chief of Police Jason Lucas said nothing like this ever happens in Upper Sandusky. The last murder was in 2001."

The incident happened in Upper Sandusky just before 4:30 p.m. on New Year's Day.

Upper Sandusky police said they were called to the store after a man was spotted waving a machete around inside the store.

Officers arrived and found a cashier identified as 22-year-old Keris L. Riebel dead.

Police charged 27-year-old Bethel M. Bekele who currently resided in Upper Sandusky in connection with the attack.

Police Chief Jared Lucas said ""Bekele entered the store with the machete approached Riebel and struck her numerous times with the machete."" Other people were in the store at the time.

The police chief said Bekele drove to the Wyandot County Sheriff’s Office afterward. That's when deputies approached his car and he surrendered to them.

Family members said online that Riebel had recently been married in October and had recently graduated from college. She’s from Nevada which is about 15 minutes from Upper Sandusky. Relatives who answered the door at her family home did not want to talk.



Little is known right now about Bekele. He’s got no apparent criminal record and police are still investigating the relationship between Bekele and Riebel. Bekele had an address in Upper Sandusky at an apartment complex. Neighbors recognized his face but knew nothing about him including his name.

Bekele is being held at the Wood County jail in Bowling Green. The police chief in Upper Sandusky said the Wyandot County jail did not have the available bed space for him. He is charged with one count of murder. His court date has not been set.

It is unclear what if any relationship existed between the victim and the suspect or what the motive was.

UPPER SANDUSKY Ohio — Editor's note: This story has been updated to reflect information from a GoFundMe started by Riebel's husband's family and information from the suspect's arraignment Tuesday.



Police have charged a 27-year-old Upper Sandusky man with murder after they say he killed a female employee at a Dollar Tree store Sunday afternoon with a machete.

Authorities apprehended Bethel M. Bekele a short time after the incident when they observed he had parked his car in front of the Wyandot County Sheriff's Office Upper Sandusky police said Monday.

Bekele surrendered himself when officers approached his vehicle police said.

Police discovered 22-year-old Keris L. Riebel a Dollar Tree cashier dead when they arrived at the store around 4:30 p.m. in response to a call about a man waving a machete around the store.

""While investigating the incident it was learned Bekele entered the store with the machete approached Riebel and struck her numerous times with the machete"" Upper Sandusky police said in a news release Monday.

Police also said Monday a motive was unclear and it is unknown if Riebel and Bekele have a previous relationship.

An autopsy will be performed by the Lucas County coroner Upper Sandusky police said.

The incident is under investigation by the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation and the Wyandot County Major Crimes Task Force.

Bekele was arraigned in Upper Sandusky Municipal Court Tuesday. He was giving a court-appointed attorney. A preliminary hearing in the case has been scheduled for Jan. 11.

Riebel and her husband Jordan were newlyweds according to a GoFundMe organized by Jordan's relatives. The campaign which met its goal of $30000 on Monday night supports funeral costs and other expenses.

Darwin Nunez has been brutally trolled by popular pizza restaurant chain Domino’s after Liverpool’s dismal display against Brentford on Monday evening.

Jurgen Klopp’s Reds were absolutely awful as they lost 3-1 against Brentford at the Gtech Community Stadium. Ibrahima Konate’s own goal plus goals from Yoane Wissa and Bryan Mbeumo secured the victory.

There has been a lot of noise about Nunez ever since his summer move to Liverpool from Benfica. With a price tag of £85 million there was huge expectation placed upon the Uruguayan.

Advert

However despite his nine goals in 21 appearances Nunez has often been criticised for wasting chances. The 23-year-old did so again during the match against the Bees.

Nunez had a good chance to score after rounding the goalkeeper but saw his shot blocked by Ben Mee he went on to make a series of poor decisions when in good positions.

To make his evening worse pizza restaurant chain Domino’s brutally trolled the Liverpool man on Twitter.

Advert

They tweeted a picture of Nunez with a caption that read: “Sorry if we’ve missed any orders tonight we’ve just had this guy start.”

Fans were quick to react to the cheeky dig made by Domino’s.

One said: “This is why Dominos is the best.”

Another tweeted: “Makes me want to order a domino’s haha.”

Advert

A third fan added: “Imagine getting trolled by Dominos.”

Someone else wrote: “Damn even Dominoes is flaming him.”

During the match Sky Sports commentators Jamie Carragher and Gary Neville both agreed that Nunez has the qualities to become a top-class striker. However they insisted that his decision-making and finishing have to improve drastically if he is to establish himself as Liverpool’s main man.

After their horror show against Brentford Liverpool will now have to dust themselves off as they prepare to start the defence of their FA Cup which starts this weekend when they take on Wolverhampton Wanderers at Anfield.

Is Little Caesars? Pizza Hut?

Not everyone wants to have a big meal for Christmas. To some a pizza strikes just the right note. But can you get pizza delivered on Christmas Day 2022?

It’s going to be tough. Little Caesars and Pizza Hut restaurants are closed on Christmas Day USA Today reports. Domino’s told USA Today that franchise owners determine whether to stay open on Christmas Day. Thus Domino’s might be your best bet but check with your individual store.

There are some other chain restaurants that are open on Christmas Day 2022 however. Keep reading for some ideas. Other well-known chain restaurants are also closed and in some cases hours will vary by location because the decision is left to individual franchise owners.

Here’s what you need to know:

Many Pizza Hut Little Caesar’s & Domino’s Locations Are Closed on Christmas Day 2022

Many if not most Pizza Hut locations are closed on Christmas Day according to The Foodxp.com. USA Today also reports that Pizza Hut stores are closed on Christmas Day.

Domino’s hours vary by location but the Domino’s restaurants we spot checked were closed on Christmas Day.

“Domino’s stores are not mandated to be open on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day. Since the majority of stores in the U.S. are franchise-owned the store hours are up to them and vary by location” a spokesperson told Newsweek.

Waffle House Is Open on Christmas Day 2022

Waffle House is one of the restaurants that keeps its doors open on Christmas Day 2022. In fact Waffle House is open every single day of the year for 24 hours each day.

Is Dunkin’ Donuts Open on Christmas Day?

The Pioneer Woman reports that Dunkin’ Donuts are open on Christmas Day. However this may not apply to all so make sure to call ahead to your hometown location.

In his VP role which he has held since June 2021 he is responsible for all of Dow’s U.S. Gulf Coast assets accounting for approximately 40% of the company’s global capacity. Additionally he is responsible for 10 advanced manufacturing sites the company’s state-of-the-art R&D Texas Innovation Center and the Houston Dow Center a strategic engineering and business hub.

Signorini also sits on the board of directors for the Texas Chemical Council Greater Houston Partnership and Economic Development Alliance of Brazoria County. In 2022 he was named Engineer of the Year by the Hispanic Engineer National Achievement Awards Conference distributed by Great Minds In STEM.

Expand Dow’s Signorini: Effective leadership company-wide excellence Dow’s Texas Operations is a healthy contributor to its community and maintains a supreme standard of excellence.

As site director of Texas Operations he is accountable for the success of all operational elements and most importantly provides an overall strategic leadership. Signorini drives continuous improvement in areas such as environmental health and safety standards and maintains Dow’s license to operate by developing and maintaining strong relationships with community state and federal political and regulatory leaders. Needless to say he goes to great lengths to maintain excellence in Dow’s endeavors.

Signorini was born and raised in São Paulo Brazil. He attended Instituto Mauá de Tecnologia a private university based in São Paulo that features one of the best engineering programs in Brazil. Three years into the five-year program Signorini started his relationship with Dow after following the advice of one of his professors and applied for a co-op position with the company.

Signorini said the most important skills needed for someone in this position are the abilities to prioritize and align the organization around key objectives; to translate the company’s objectives into actionable pragmatic goals and objectives; and to inspire the organization to reach higher levels of performance by fostering open communication engaging everyone in the solution and creating an inclusive and psychologically safe environment for people to innovate and thrive. Thinking big and creating a vision without losing site of what is reality is key.

Signorini believes this philosophy has always lined up perfectly with Dow’s. Headquartered in Midland Michigan Dow just celebrated 125 years of operations. The first site outside of Midland known as Texas Operations was built in Freeport Texas in 1940 and is Dow’s largest integrated manufacturing site. It’s also the largest single company chemical complex in the world with more than 40 production plants that manufacture over 40% of Dow products sold in the U.S. and 25% sold globally.

Research development and manufacturing at Dow’s Texas sites produce key ingredients and innovations that enable the creation of hundreds of everyday products such as paints adhesives sealants paper coatings caulk electronics food packaging health care necessities and other household and industrial products.

Signorini enjoys knowing the products being produced by Dow help deliver a better life to so many people but his No. 1 goal always comes back to workplace safety.

“I think the biggest challenge comes from making sure Dow maintains a safe environment for employees contractors and the community” he stated. “There is nothing more important than this as we strive to hold ourselves to higher standards. I am proud to work for a company that is relentless in the pursuit of best-in-class safety performance.”

Dow has a strong safety culture throughout the company. The year 2021 was record-setting in terms of safety performance at Texas Operations however as more employees returned to the workplace Signorini said he did see a slight uptick in minor injuries. A renewed emphasis on eliminating distractions and focusing on the task at hand resulted in a downward trend for the second half of 2022.

In 2021 Dow’s employee and contractor injury rate for large American Chemical Council companies was 0.16. Dow’s 2021 Process Safety Containment Event (PSCE) Tier 1+2 rate for large American Chemical Council companies was .08 the lowest in the category.

As for Dow’s community involvement Signorini said from event sponsorships to STEM grants to local K-12 schools and community colleges to logging hundreds of volunteer hours with local non-profit organizations the team at Dow is committed to the success of its community

Community involvement not only directly aids local families but also provides further opportunity for employees in the communities surrounding every Dow facility to show that they are committed to being a good neighbor and supportive partner.

Regarding new sites Dow is currently building an integrated methylene diphenyl diisocyanate distillation and prepolymers facility at its world-scale manufacturing site in Freeport Texas. This investment supports increasing demand for downstream polyurethane products and advances Dow’s leading positions in attractive applications in construction consumer and industrial markets.

Dow is also building a new global scale polyethylene plant in Freeport Texas that would utilize raw materials from both internal and external sources to produce linear low- density polyethylene (LLDPE).

Signorini also had much to say on how legislation is affecting industry. He stated one of his primary concerns is establishing a new school district property tax incentive program.

“While we were disappointed that the previous program wasn’t renewed we look at this as an opportunity to come up with a better and more transparent program that can still benefit all involved while providing incentive for companies like Dow to locate new investments or perhaps even modernize current older assets” he said.

Energy costs are also a top consideration for industry. In 2021 the Legislature passed SB 3 to fix issues discovered during Winter Storm Uri. Signorini feels it is important to give SB 3 implementation time to work and not make further significant changes to the market structure that will continue to drive energy costs up.

Of additional concern is the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) which will be up for review during the upcoming session. Signorini believes there are some changes that could be made regarding accessibility in permitting to modernize TCEQ but the Legislature should be cautious not to make large scale changes to the actual process.

He further explained that Texas Operations is a landmark manufacturing site for Dow and this location has catapulted Dow into the future. With more than 80 years of history in Texas the site has evolved and has reinvented itself several times. The energy transformation and sustainability efforts will create a unique opportunity to once again reshape its asset footprint at the site. In Texas and in Brazoria County it found a great platform to innovate with customers partner with communities and operate assets in a safe and reliable way.

Jude Owen Dow was born at LincolnHealth Miles Maternity in Damariscotta at 12:44 a.m. Sunday according to spokesman John Martins.

Martins said he checked with a half dozen other Maine hospitals and Jude appears to be the first baby born in Maine this year coming in ahead of Esther Florandy Saint Aude who was born at Portland’s Maine Medical Center at 2:31 a.m. Sunday.

Jude is the son of Kasey and Zachary Dow of Waldoboro and is the couple’s first child. He weighed 8 pounds 1/2 ounce and was 20 1/2 inches tall.

The couple had planned for a home birth with two midwives attending but a complication forced them to go to the hospital around midnight on New Year’s Eve as fireworks lit the skies in the neighboring town of Friendship. Kasey went into labor at about 8:15 pm. Friday.

“As we were pulling out of the parking lot the ball was dropping” Kasey recalled. She was taken to LincolnHealth in an ambulance and gave birth a short time after reaching the hospital.

The couple returned home Monday. “I’m doing better now” Kasey said Monday night in a telephone interview. She praised the two midwives who tended to her during pregnancy.

“Jude is in perfect health. He is a very good eater and sleeper” Kasey said. “We are super blessed and very happy.”

And having Maine’s first baby of 2023? “Well that’s just icing on the cake’’ said Zachary an electrician.

Two other New Year’s Day babies were delivered at hospitals in Portland and Augusta.

Esther Florandy Saint Aude was born at Maine Medical Center weighing seven pounds 11 ounces and 21 inches long. Her parents are Emmanuella Saint Aude and Widner Los of Westbrook according to Maine Medical Center spokesman Clay Holtzman.

Lawrence Patrice Audet IV was the Augusta area’s first baby of 2023. Audet was born at Alfond Center for Health at 10:30 a.m. Sunday and weighed 8 pounds 9 ounces. His parents are Amber Audet 30 and Lawrence Audet III 32. Baby Lawrence is Amber’s second child and Lawrence’s first.

The year 2022 marked 50 years of the Stockholm Declaration when 122 countries — 70 of them developing and poor countries — essentially committed to 26 principles and an action plan that set in a multilateral environmental regime.

In 2022 “Stockholm+50: A healthy planet for the prosperity of all — our responsibility our opportunity” was held in the Swedish capital. World leaders gathered to discuss how the next 50 years would be treated with emergency actions.

In the run-up to the meet Down To Earth brought out a special edition on the Stockholm Declaration and the road ahead:

Richard Mahapatra talked about how the world needs to up its game to prevent the planet’s environmental crisis.

Sunita Narain opined about how the 50th anniversary celebration of the Stockholm Conference should be about the common future of humanity not the divisions of the past.

Narain also wrote that when the world marks the 50th anniversary of the 1972 Stockholm Conference it needs to discuss consumption and production.

Pushpam Kumar felt that sustainability should command top priority when the world met to review Stockholm; post-pandemic recovery must be inclusive he added.

Kiran Pandey and Rajit Sengupta explained with the help of data about what the world did after Stockholm.

Koshy Cherail talked on how power generation and transmission models that are local and self-sustaining can increase access to energy in the future.

Felix Bast delved into how countries should draft an Arctic Treaty System in line with its Antarctic counterpart.

Rajib Dasgupta wrote about the securitisation of pandemics and the One Health approach.

Pia M Kohler wrote that if science-policy interfaces are to deliver just and effective solutions to climate change they must involve indigenous peoples and local communities.

M Rajeevan talked about the warming of the oceans.

Roy Cooper pointed out details on a tabletop architectural model of a huge building under construction in northeast Charlotte.

“It’s amazing” Cooper beamed “what a billion dollars can do.”

At the June 2021 gathering at Charlotte’s University Research Park Neidorff told Cooper Mayor Vi Lyles and others that 3230 employees would soon work in the 800000-square-foot structure for the nation’s largest Medicaid managed-care insurance company.

The $450 million in potential state and local incentive payments arranged by Cooper and others helped entice what promised to be one of North Carolina’s biggest economic-development home runs. Lyles hailed the project as a “milestone” for the area.

The plan called for a completed building by late 2022 when construction would be well under way on adjacent campus projects. Centene envisioned recreational areas a child-care site and other amenities.

It all sounded logical given Neidorff’s success in creating a Fortune 500 company with 71000 employees. Centene’s plans seemed akin to New York financial services giant TIAA which opened an adjacent 92-acre campus in 2000 that now employs 5000.

But Neidorff’s promises of new jobs and investment are now a distant memory.

In August Centene told Cooper it was quitting the unfinished project after investing $700 million. That’s more than triple the amount of money that Carolina Panthers David Tepper walked away from at his ballyhooed Rock Hill South Carolina development after disputes with municipal leaders earlier this year.

The Centene property which Neidorff said would become its East Coast headquarters is listed for sale by the Cushman & Wakefield real estate firm. It’s hoped that a major enterprise will pounce on the building — probably at a big discount. “They’re watching a couple of hundred million dollars evaporate” says a Charlotte executive who helped attract Centene.

Centene in a statement says the reversal reflects “a funda-mental shift in the way people want to work. About 90% of our workforce is fully remote or in a hybrid work environment and workplace flexibility is essential to attracting and retaining top talent.” Officials declined to elaborate.

The company is “drastically” office space across the U.S. as more employees work remotely or in hybrid settings notes Sam Chan Cooper’s press secretary. The company employs 1300 statewide including 700 in Charlotte.

But there was much more to Centene’s expensive incursion into the University City area near UNC Charlotte than bungled planning and a shifting workplace culture according to people familiar with the failed project. Several other factors behind the abrupt shift have received limited attention.

Perhaps most notable with all due respect is that Michael Neidorff is dead.

An infection claimed the CEO’s life in April at age 79 ending an increasingly fractious relationship with investors Centene’s home state of Missouri regulators board members and others. He had gone on medical leave two months earlier.

As the Charlotte project was rising Neidorff was facing growing dissatisfaction by institutional investors over the company’s financial performance and significant pressures from regulators over its operations.

In November 2021 he agreed with New York-based hedge fund Politan Capital Management to step down as CEO and executive chair in late 2022. The deal also included remaking Centene’s board with six directors leaving and five new ones added.

Politan owned less than 1% of Centene’s stock or about $900 million while Neidorff personally controlled about $500 million. But Politan founder Quentin Koffey had successfully forced management upheaval at his previous jobs. While working for the New York-based DE Shaw fund in 2018 he was credited with helping oust Robert Niblock who had been CEO of Mooresville-based Lowe’s Cos. for 13 years.

Given Centene’s long-term history investor complaints seemed surprising. It’s hard to understate Neidorff’s impact which in some ways mirrors Charlottean Hugh McColl Jr.’s skill of turning a regional bank into Bank of America.

The Altoona Pennsylvania native joined the health insurance company when it was based in Milwaukee Wisconsin in 1995. A year later he moved the headquarters to St. Louis where he had led a physicians-owned health plan. He took Centene public in 2001 when it had $327 million in revenue and 235000 members.

By 2013 revenue topped $10 billion with a membership of 2.7 million. Its rapid growth continued with revenue likely to top $135 billion this year. During the decade ended December 2021 the company’s stock soared more than 750% double the S&P 500 Index.

That history didn’t impress Politan which criticized Centene for profit margins that lagged peers causing its shares to stagnate between 2018-21. Also it isn’t unusual for hedge funds to target aging CEOs with unclear succession strategies. During his final years as CEO Neidorff received annual compensation of about $25 million. No other company executive topped $10 million.

Centene also faced headwinds because of criticism that it profits at the expense of its main customers low-income Americans. It’s the largest provider of health-insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplaces and the largest provider of Medicaid managed care with 15.4 million enrollees nationally.

Most state Medicaid programs contract with private insurers to cover people who have disabilities or low incomes. The programs are jointly funded by state and federal taxpayers. In many states the insurers procure medications for the program through a pharmacy benefit manager which acts as an intermediary between health plans and pharmacies. Centene has both a health plan and a PBM.

In September Texas became the 12th state to settle claims that Centene had defrauded their Medicaid programs involving excessive charges for pharmacy services. The settlements have totaled $475 million according to Kaiser Health News.

Centene has denied any wrongdoing and continues to operate in the states where it has struck settlements. But it set aside $1.1 billion to settle the allegations according to company filings. It’s not clear if Centene is under investigation in North Carolina.

Ohio Attorney General David Yost in an interview faults Centene for “corporate greed.” A Mississippi legislator accused the company of taking “$55 million of our money that was supposed to be spent on the poor the sick the elderly the mentally ill and disabled.”

Neidorff thought the big Charlotte site could help consolidate operations and improve Centene’s financial performance says a company official who asked to remain anonymous. It also reflected an emphasis on East Coast states after Centene’s $17 billion acquisition of Tampa Florida-based WellCare Health Plans in 2019. But questions on why companies need more office space spiked during the pandemic.

“The desire for flexibility in work was driving change” says Tobe Holmes senior director for land use and economic development of University City Partners a nonprofit that promotes the area where Centene planned to operate. He recalls discussing the issue with Gov. Cooper before the pandemic broke out in early 2020.

“Centene has some very skilled people and some call centers can be virtual with people who can discuss health care benefits. Others like in banking find people more efficient when they’re in the office together” Holmes says.

To be sure the pandemic has changed the landscape of corporate workplaces.

In Charlotte Duke Energy says remote work is enabling it to cut office-space needs by 60% which will save $90 million a year in real-estate leases. The company is consolidating its downtown Charlotte operations into the new 40-story Duke Energy Plaza slated to open in early 2023. The company ended its lease of 21 floors of the nearby Duke Energy Center and is selling its former 13-story headquarters building.

Other corporations have had second thoughts about remote work after measuring productivity. Last fall Bank of America limited the time that some staffers could work from home to two days a month. CEO Brian Moynihan has emphasized the benefits of building corporate culture through office work.

Centene’s cut-and-run also came amid significant tension between Neidorff and politicians in the company’s home state. Beyond his status building one of Missouri’s most successful companies he gained respect for promoting diversity long before it became popular in corporate America. He also made Centene a major philanthropic force in St. Louis which has struggled to retain major corporate headquarters.

Clayton Missouri Mayor Michelle Harris says she grew very fond of Neidorff. “He was a visionary leader and a person who’d take action on his visions. He didn’t just talk about it he went out and did it.”

Neidorff also wasn’t afraid to raise concerns publicly. In press interviews and comments to civic groups he complained about the increasing murder and crime rates in St. Louis.

Leading up to the location decision several Charlotte officials say that Neidorff repeatedly compared the Queen City’s crime statistics and available workforce favorably to similar metrics in St. Louis.

“Mr. Neidorff basically put a stake in the ground and said ‘Hell no St. Louis we aren’t doing this anymore” says a Charlotte official who asked not to be identified because of his role in recruiting Centene. “He was really angry at St. Louis but he kind of kept it under cover. He had a special bee in his bonnet about getting away from there.”

Neidorff also was disappointed that Missouri didn’t increase Medicaid funding according to several sources familiar with the matter. He met with Gov. Michael Parsons in 2021 but Press Secretary Kelli Jones declined to discuss the subject of the meeting.

Sources say Neidorff told Parsons that Missouri was an “embarrassment” for refusing to boost Medicaid funding his company’s core business. Missouri voters had approved an increase but Parsons refused to sign enabling legislation after the state’s Republican lawmakers declined to fund the growth. (North Carolina has not approved expanded Medicaid funding either.)

Whether the CEO threatened to move the company headquarters to Charlotte is unclear. Clayton Mayor Harris doubts it. “He cared very much about the St. Louis community at large and he was committed to the business community and trying to attract other companies here” she says. “His family lives here. I couldn’t imagine him saying that.”

To succeed Neidorff a month after his medical leave began Centene’s board picked a CEO with a very different history: Sarah London 41 had worked for a venture-capital division of rival United Healthcare before joining Centene to lead digital strategy in 2020. The Harvard University graduate and University of Chicago MBA is an expert in data analytics and technology innovation.

“[She] was the absolute opposite of Neidorff” says a Charlotte official who worked with the company. “This was a total change in attitude about what technology can provide for the future.” London had confidence that remote communications technology could serve customers with less need for office space.

“Mr. Neidorff was proceeding in a way the board didn’t appreciate” the executive said. “This gave her the leverage she needed to dump the project altogether.”

Centene paid $10 million for its initial 80-acre tract in University Research Park then added another 130 acres. It planned to pay average salaries topping more than $100000 according to data required to secure state incentives.

Writing off hundreds of million of dollars isn’t a major hit for Centene which has a market value of nearly $50 billion. Its stock gained about 4% this year through early December; the S&P 500 Index declined 14% in the same period.

It’s unclear if the building will end up in the hands of a single tenant or include multiple occupants says Jade Hubbard a spokesperson for Cushman & Wakefield. The building remains unfinished.

Holmes the University Research Park official says “Centene was locating in University City for a reason and those reasons still exist.” It’s the region’s second-largest employment center with close proximity to nearby UNC Charlotte.

The Commission voted at its last meeting of the year to give the Sheriff's department the budgetary authority to hire cadets as a way to fill up the pipleine of eligible hires.

Sheriff Reich spoke to Fox 47 News last year about some of the challenges he was facing because of staff shortages and upcoming retirements.

The cadet program will allow people looking to join the force a chance to learn on the job while earning money.

""Sheirff Reich now has a cadet program in which we granted the sheriff the bugetary authority where he can hire someone at a part-time wage of $17 an hour if they want to be a cadet and be hired by the Eaton County Sheriff's department"" said former Eaton County Commission chair Jeremy Whittum.

Sheriff Reich had previously asked the County Commission to approve a $10000 retention and recrutiment bonus for his department because of staff shortages.

The Commission approved $5000 bonuses for all non-elected employees over the next two years.

To recognize his life-long contribution to the North Pacific Fishing Industry and his countless hours of community service the Norwegian Commercial Club (NCC) presented John Douglas Dixon Pacific Fishermen Shipyard with its highest honor the King Neptune Award during the 70th Annual Fishermen’s Night in December. He joins the ranks of Industry leaders Trident Seafoods Chuck Bundrant Kaare Ness and Bart Eaton MARCO’s Peter Schmidt Sam LeClercq Dr. Wally Pereyra and Senators Ted Stevens Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell for this prestigious award.

The NCC King Neptune Award was initiated to honor individuals or organizations whose contributions have furthered the economic growth well-being and recognition of the North Pacific fishing industry. The award is intended to honor long-term commitments and contributions to the industry as well as breakthrough contributions. The Award has been presented annually since 1977. Dixon has been actively involved in the maritime industry for nearly 50 years.

Following graduation from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Science in Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering he started his career in 1974 in California at Global Marine with design work on drill ships a Norwegian Aker H-3 oil drilling platform and supporting the work of the CIA with the HUGHES GLOMAR EXPLORER recovering a sunken Russian nuclear submarine off the coast of Hawaii.

In 1977 when the king crab biomass and value rose dramatically Dixon headed north to MARCO Shipyard to Seattle to design and build crab boats. He was able to guide fishermen on what they wanted in their new boats. Mr. Dixon worked with Norwegian-American fishing pioneers of the day including highliners and their vessels like the F/V NORTHWESTERN of Deadliest Catch fame together with sales of the multitude of different types of hydraulic machinery MARCO invented. After his departure from MARCO in 1991 Dixon worked for Det Norske Veritas (DNV) certifying all types of vessels then subsequently Lunde Electric and Guido Perla Naval Architects.

Since 2001 he has served as General Manager of Pacific Fishermen Shipyard and Electric concurrently with independent consulting through Dixon Marine Surveys to the USCG USN NOAA EPA DOJ and vessel owners on shipboard design operational and tort matters.

Dixon assisted in the passage of the 1987 Commercial Fishing Industry US Vessel Anti-Reflagging and Foreign Reconstruction Act and the US Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel Safety Act of 1988. His training in Norway as a Ship Surveyor by Classification Society DNV included conducting compliance surveys for US Fishing Vessel Safety Act International Loadline SOLAS Safety of Life at Seas United Nation’s MARPOL Marine Pollution Convention for international commercial vessels and OSHA for the US fishing fleet.

Dixon has spent countless hours providing smoked fish to different events around the Nordic Community including 2000 pounds a year at Ballard Seafood Fest and the Norwegian American Chamber of Commerce Annual BBQ where he was named 34th Person of the Year in 2014 in spite of his Scotch Irish heritage!

Dixon has been actively involved in the Ballard High School Maritime Program helping to keep the Norwegian maritime tradition continuing in Seattle. He has also served as President of the Norwegian Commercial Club and is a member of its Fisheries Committee in addition to driving the shipyard’s “Deadliest Sweeper” in the Norwegian 17th of May parade. Dixon’s connection to the Norwegian community is not only that he works with many Norwegian fishermen and companies. His wife Maryanne is of Norwegian descent and his son Jacob Steffen owns Work Wear Inc. a company that supplies the North Pacific fishing fleet with Norwegian and Swedish workwear.

In 2020 Mr. Dixon was awarded the Propeller Club Maritime Achievement Award joining the ranks with Senator Warren G. Magnuson and Governor Dixy Lee Ray for significant contributions to the maritime community.

Dixon and his wife Maryanne raised their three children Jake Rosie and Chloe in Ballard. They have recently retired to Enetai Beach on the Kitsap Peninsula where they enjoy watching the fast ferries tugs and fishing boats go by that he has worked on throughout his career along with beachcombing kite flying crabbing and fishing with their three grandchildren Julia Jonah and Claire.

Some of the infants were in coffins while some were wrapped in cloth and loose bones were also found buried in the ground. The story made headlines around the UK with newspapers from Edinburgh to London reporting the grim news. But had a crime been committed?

On the evening of Thursday September 1 1910 William Griffiths set about digging over the back garden of the house he and his wife had recently moved into. The garden had not been cultivated for a while and was covered in weeds and grass. Mr Griffiths ran a greengrocery shop from the front of the Brynhyfryd premises and wanted to plant cabbages in the garden likely to supplement his stock. He had not been digging for long when he unearthed what he at first thought was a wooden box. As he dug a little further he found it was in fact a small coffin made of elm.

Mr Griffiths rushed to tell his wife and she advised him to contact the police so the next morning he went to fetch the local constable. The officer called for a joiner who opened the coffin. Inside was the badly decomposed body of a baby. The officer took over the digging and quickly found more coffins prompting him to close the Eaton Road greengrocers shop and to call in colleagues.. Further digging was carried out in the garden and tiny coffin after tiny coffin body after body wrapped in cloth was uncovered in the plot. With nowhere else to put them some of the exhumed bodies were placed in an empty ""Pure Irish creamery butter"" box and covered with a cloth.

News of was happening in Eaton Road quickly spread and the South Wales Daily Post – the original name of the South Wales Evening Post – reported that at first hundreds and then thousands of people flocked to the area to see what was going on with some people climbing nearby walls and clambering onto shed roofs so they could get a glimpse into the garden. The paper said: ""The vicinity of the house was thronged with hundreds of people – men women and children – whose number increased to thousands as time wore on and wildest of rumours were bandied about... Gruesome-minded would-be spectators who could only guess however what the occasional thud of shovel on wood really meant"". The paper reported that in the local Brynhyfryd and Manselton areas ""rumour was piled upon rumour"" as the true extent of what was happening became apparent.

The police quickly established that the house had previously been occupied by an undertaker who had recently left Swansea and gone to sea where he was ""working before the mast"" meaning he was an apprentice sailor. However the undertaker's wife and children were living in nearby Frederick Street and when questioned the wife said she knew nothing about the back garden burials. Following the gruesome discovery she took her children to live with relatives in the Sandfields area of the town.

By the end of that sad Friday a total of 16 bodies had been recovered. Doctors were brought in to examine the remains and it was quickly established that many of the bodies were those of stillborn or newborn babies while some were a little older. The Post described one of the medics a Dr John Evans as looking ""whole volumes expressive of undiluted and sincere amazement"".

Over the following weekend police set about trying to identify the babies and more than a dozen women came forward to say they believed their child may be among those recovered from the garden. This was an era when home deliveries were the norm and it seems many births and newborn deaths went unregistered and unrecorded. Given the length of time the bodies had been in the ground the pieces of simple clothing the infants were wrapped in was one of the few ways of possibly identifying them.

Only one of the bodies was ultimately identified and was given an inquest – Kenneth Holmes the son of Harriet and James Holmes from Orchard Street in Swansea town centre. Little Kenneth had died when just a couple of hours old. The court heard he was identified by the coffin which his dad had made for him. The boy's mother said he had entrusted the body of the infant to the undertaker for burial in Cwmgelli cemetery in Treboeth. As evidence a receipt of bill was shown to the court which read: ""To grave and burial of child at Cwmgelly Cemetery 6s"". The mum said her son's birth had been registered but registering the death had been left to the undertaker.

The coroner Viner Leeder said while it appeared the undertaker had done nothing illegal he had acted improperly and without decency in burying the infants in the garden rather than in a cemetery and apparently pocketing the money he received from the grieving families. The court heard that an examination of birth and death registers showed Kenneth Holmes' death had not been entered meaning as far as the authorities were concerned the boy was still alive. The court heard that had the undertaker been in the country he would have been brought before the coroner who would have ""censured him very severely"". The inquest recorded a verdict that Kenneth Holmes had died of natural causes. All the babies recovered from the Brynhyfryd back garden – 15 of them never to be identified – were subsequently interred at Swansea Cemetery at the expense of the poor law authorities.

The event called ‘The Hadrian’ will also give passengers the opportunity to experience the 183-year old Tyne Valley Line and speed along the East Coast Main Line due to part of the return journey following the River Tyne which is a few miles south of Hadrian’s Wall taking place with the Railway Touring Company.

A spokesperson for the operator said: ""Between Hellifield and Carlisle there is scarcely a level mile but our powerful steam locomotive will negotiate the 78 miles of rising and falling gradients in truly classic style.

“Settle Junction marks the beginning of one of Britain’s most arduous climbs a total of 15 miles mainly at a gradient of 1 in 100. This will be a tough test for our locomotive which we will see – and hear – working very hard!

""We cross the breath-taking Ribblehead Viaduct high above the valley floor and enter Blea Moor Tunnel. The route runs high above valleys and over numerous viaducts to Dent the highest main line station open in England.

""We make the final climb to Ais Gill Summit all 1169 feet of it the dramatic peak of our journey! We descend through the valley at Mallerstang and then drop down through Kirkby Stephen to Lazenby where our steam locomotive pauses to take on water.

""We can expect a fast run downhill from Lazenby along the Eden Valley to Carlisle where we arrive at around 2pm. There will be time to explore the ‘border’ city with its many attractions that include the castle cathedral Tullie House Museum the pedestrianised English Street and the Lanes Shopping Centre.""

Returning back will see the train leave Carlisle at around 4pm and will take the Tyne Valley line towards Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The locomotive will then go through Wylam.

Then the train will speed south through Durham to Darlington where the Flying Scotsman will be replaced by the diesel locomotive. The journey will then continue to York home to the National Railway Museum and back to the outward stations before arriving in Derby by 11pm.

Prices for the event start at £175 for adults and £130 for juniors. Visit The Railway Touring Company website here for more information. However the scheduled date may be subject to change and new events will be announced.

The Flying Scotsman entered service 100 years ago. This year on February 24 marks the 100 years since it first entered service.

Taking first place in the weirdness stakes is an item being offered in the 'totally bizarre collectables' subcategory - belly button fluff.

The fluff has been listed for auction by a seller in Worcester who says it is ""freshly picked every day for about a month"".

Perhaps unsurprisingly the fluff which was listed with a starting bid of 99p currently has no bids.

Next up are a selection of death masks being offered by a seller in Gloucester.

The life-sized masks promising a ""real leathery finish"" offer buyers the opportunity to put faces including those of inventor Nikola Tesla or serial killer Amelia Dyer on their wall.

They are available for £15 with £5 postage.

Also for sale in Gloucester is a voodoo doll complete with its own pins.

Available for just £11 the seller says the nine-inch tall doll would make a ""great"" gift.

More weirdness is available in the form of a Sheela-na-gig also for sale in Gloucester.

The replica based on the figurative carvings of naked women displaying their genitals found in churches has a £35 asking price.

The PASCAL Precision Transcatheter Valve Repair System is used to repair the mitral valve of the heart without the need for open-heart surgery. The device system includes a permanent implant and a delivery system. The primary components of the implant are constructed from nitinol (a nickel titanium alloy) and covered in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) cloth.

The PASCAL Precision Transcatheter Valve Repair System implant is inserted using a tube-like device called a delivery catheter through the largest vein (femoral vein) in the groin area and guided through the blood vessel to the left side of the heart. The permanent implant looks and functions like a clip. Once in the heart the clip is used to grasp the two tissue flaps (leaflets) of the mitral valve in the heart which is the valve that controls blood flow between the top and bottom chambers of the heart’s left side. The implant clips the two flaps together to reduce the backflow of blood through the valve (mitral regurgitation). After the clip is in place it is disconnected from the delivery catheter and then the delivery catheter is removed from the body.

The PASCAL Precision Transcatheter Valve Repair System is intended to be used to treat patients with significant (a grade greater than or equal to 3+) mitral regurgitation caused by abnormal mitral valve leaflets and/or the area around the leaflets when open-heart surgery is considered too risky.

The PASCAL Precision Transcatheter Valve Repair System is intended to reduce the amount of blood that moves in the wrong direction through the mitral valve. As a result the patient may have:

fewer hospitalizations

improved quality of life

relief of symptoms such as tiredness or fatigue

improved ability to exercise

A clinical study compared the results of 117 patients treated with the PASCAL Precision Transcatheter Valve Repair System with of 63 patients who were treated with a commercially available similar device. The study showed that the two devices had similar low risks for major complications at 30 days post-implant and reduction in the amount of blood flowing back through the valve (lowering mitral regurgitation grade to less than or equal to 2+) at 6 months post-implant.

The PASCAL Precision system should not be used in patients who:

Cannot tolerate certain blood thinners during or after the procedure

Have an untreatable allergy to nickel titanium or X-ray contrast media

Have an active infection of the mitral valve (endocarditis)

Have mitral regurgitation caused by rheumatic disease

Have evidence of blood clots in the heart or veins leading to the heart

Both were “experiences.”

At Nobu New York we were seated adjacent to Billy Crystal who wanted no part of being recognized but nonetheless so freaked out by it couldn’t concentrate on the food. In Nobu Aspen/Matsuhisa I was worried about entertaining guests vis a vis the astounding bill for small portions. Again it was all about the “experience” ergo people “who can’t afford it” should be prepared.

Buckhead Atlanta scores both the restaurant and the Nobu Hotel making us all the more privileged. On Nov. 30 I attended the grand opening at Nobu Hospitality as local dignitaries and community leaders cut the ribbon on the back side of Phipps Plaza near Saks Fifth Avenue. The property serves as Nobu’s 15th location overall and first in Georgia making its debut in Buckhead at the modern re-imagined mixed-use Phipps Plaza.

Designed by Rockwell Group the hotel features 152 guest rooms and suites including a rooftop pool with surrounding event space corporate conference rooms and a state-of-the-art fitness center with Technogym equipment. Nobu Atlanta Restaurant celebrated for its signature new-style Japanese cuisine now welcomes diners to the new 10000 square-foot space serving iconic Nobu dishes alongside specialties featuring local homegrown ingredients.

“It’s an honor to launch the Nobu brand in Atlanta’s vibrant Buckhead community at Phipps Plaza” said Nobu Hospitality Group CEO Trevor Horwell. “Our approach to hospitality embracing sophisticated accommodations and outstanding cuisine will offer guests the ultimate luxury lifestyle experience in the heart of Atlanta.”

As malls like Cumberland and North Point search to redefine themselves edging away from the straight retail sector Phipps Plaza is also striving for more “work play and shop” options. In early December Life Time and Life Time Work will open its 90000 square-foot luxury athletic country club and 30000 square-foot premium co-working destination. This is an addition to the now open One Phipps Plaza a 365000 square-foot LEED certified 13-story Class A office tower. Early next year Citizens Culinary Market a 24000 square-foot upscale lifestyle food concept is scheduled to open injecting new culinary concepts into Phipps’ unique lineup. Remember Atlanta favorite Alon’s Bakery & Market is on the Peachtree Street side.

Simon Property Group Senior Vice President Development and Asset Intensification Patrick Peterman said “We’re excited to celebrate the opening of Nobu Hotel & Restaurant Atlanta as our vision of Phipps Plaza becomes a reality for guests to enjoy from the Southeast and beyond. Nobu’s unique allure and high-end reputation reinforces Phipps Plaza as a world-class destination for hospitality shopping dining work and entertainment.”

Thinking about booking a wedding b’nai mitzvah or conference? Group and event sales manager Samantha Hertzig noted “One of the exciting events we have booked for the summer of 2023 is a large Indian wedding. We also have slated a few events with National Sales Network in 2023. Recently we have hosted Caesars Entertainment Assent Inc Cartessa Edwards Lifesciences WestRock Baker Donelson and Associated Luxury Hotels International.”

Nobu Atlanta also has private dining options. The Private Room can accommodate up to 24 guests while the Sake Room accommodates up to 12 guests. In-room dining is also available for guests looking to dine in privacy. Guests can expect to find signature Nobu menu items as well as dishes reflecting local culture and cuisine.

(Blacksmith) and Forge Therapeutics (Forge) announce today that the companies have signed a definitive merger agreement to leverage their combined chemistry platforms creating a leading biopharma dedicated to discovering and developing medicines targeting a large class of proteins called metalloenzymes with initial focus on oncology and infection.

""We are excited to unveil the merger of Blacksmith and Forge which we believe will be transformational for both companies. Prospects are very bright for the new Blacksmith as we are now able to expand our metalloenzyme platform advance our internal and partnered programs and create increased value for our shareholders by discovering first-in-class and best-in-class medicines"" said Zachary Zimmerman Ph.D. CEO and co-founder of Blacksmith. ""Our target strategy is to focus on metalloenzymes of significant unmet need and high pharma interest targets with validated biology that have been challenging to drug due to chemistry limitations that we can solve with our platform.""

The Blacksmith platform has been validated through multiple pharmaceutical partnerships including deals with Roche Eli Lilly and Basilea which have the potential to earn over $800M in milestone payments plus royalties. Furthermore the company currently has earned non-dilutive federal awards of up to $25.3M to fully fund its infectious disease programs to the end of Phase 1. Blacksmith also has emerging precision oncology programs focused on novel synthetic lethality targets involved in the DNA Damage Response. Blacksmith investors include Evotec A.G. MagnaSci Ventures MP Healthcare Partners Alexandria Venture Investments and Eli Lilly.

About metalloenzymes and the Blacksmith platform

Metalloenzymes utilize a metal ion cofactor in the enzyme active site to perform essential biological functions. This diverse class of targets has historically been difficult to drug due to small molecule chemistry limitations that have plagued the industry. The Blacksmith metalloenzyme platform has solved this problem by leveraging the following:

A large proprietary fragment library of metal-binding pharmacophores (MBPs);

A comprehensive database containing a full characterization of the metalloenzyme genome including functions metal cofactors and associations to disease;

A first-of-its-kind metallo-CRISPR library of custom single guide RNAs;

An industry-leading metalloenzyme computational toolkit for docking modeling and structure-based drug design; and

A robust and blocking intellectual property estate covering bioinorganic medicinal and computational chemistry approaches for metalloenzyme-targeted medicines.

About Blacksmith Medicines

At Blacksmith Medicines we are developing medicines targeting metal-dependent enzymes. Over 30% of known enzymes are metalloenzymes covering all major enzyme classes: oxidoreductases transferases hydrolases lyases isomerases and ligases. Metal ions including magnesium zinc iron manganese and copper are the essential ingredient in these metalloenzymes. We recognized a large unmet need for new chemical matter and innovative approaches to drug this important class of enzymes. Our purpose-built platform for metalloenzyme-targeted medicines combines for the first time in industry a focused library of metal-binding pharmacophores with proprietary computational modeling approaches to rapidly and rationally design small molecule inhibitors that interact with key metal ions in the enzyme's active site. Our comprehensive knowledge of the metal environment and key active site interactions enables Blacksmith to rapidly build potent and selective inhibitors in a stepwise and predictable manner.

Pancreatic Cancer Overview

Pancreatic cancer develops in the pancreas tissues an abdomen organ located behind the stomach's bottom portion. The pancreas secretes hormones that help control blood sugar and enzymes that aid digestion. Pancreatic cancer is a condition in which malignant (cancer) cells develop in pancreatic tissues. The pancreas can develop tumors in various ways including malignant and noncancerous tumors. However the precise causes of pancreatic cancer are unknown. Individuals diagnosed with pancreatic cancer before the tumor develops or spreads have an average life expectancy of pancreatic cancer of 3 to 3.5 years.

Pancreatic cancer symptoms may include jaundice dark urine weight loss loss of appetite fatigue and others. A pancreatic cancer diagnosis is difficult because symptoms are frequently confused with those of other disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome. The extent of the cancer determines the treatment of pancreatic cancer options. Pancreatic cancer treatment options may include surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy targeted therapy or a combination of these.

You may know of naloxone by the names Narcan and Kloxxado. The medication can reverse an overdose of opioids such as heroin fentanyl and prescription opioid medications.

To request a free kit click here. A request form is needed to be filled out and then a short training video about the usage of Naloxone follows. Kits are mailed to the person requesting one.

Information is kept confidential and responses only identify areas of need and to help MSDH improve its services under the program.

Your local pharmacist can dispense naloxone without a prescription from a doctor or other medical practitioner so Mississippians can go to their local pharmacy to request it.

Mississippi is also working to ensure that all of the state’s emergency services have naloxone on hand and know how to administer it.

Additionally the sneaker is also paired with blacked-out contrasts — such as on the midfoot’s panel assortment and clad tongue tooling. Finer details of “Team Gold” are spread across the tongue and the sneaker’s upper as well as the customary Three Stripe branding and forefoot lace loop.

Rounding off the design the Crazy 97 features additional adidas Equipment branding on the ankle’s purple trim while a further logo that reads “Feet You Wear” is complemented with a semi-translucent finish.

Filings with OSFI Canada’s bank regulator show the value of loans secured by housing continued to advance in October. Over the past year growth of loans secured by home equity has surged at one of the fastest rates ever. It’s still too early to tell but there are some signs that higher interest rates have begun to slow the pace of borrowing.

Canadians Have $309 Billion In Home Equity Debt

Canadian homeowners have borrowed against a significant amount of equity. Loans secured by home equity rocketed to $308.9 billion in October up 0.1% (+$0.3 billion) from a month before. The balance is a whopping 9.6% (+$27.0 billion) higher compared to the same month last year. For comparison it’s equivalent in size to Alberta’s gross domestic product (GDP). It’s huge for consumer loans.

Canadians Using Their Home As An ATM Might Be Slowing

Monthly growth shows some signs of the trend slowing. October’s growth rate was the smallest in nearly two years last matched in January 2021. It was also the worst October since 2019 when interest rates last hit a cycle peak. The slow month put an end to the highest annual growth reported in decades possibly ever.

Canadian Debt Secured By Home Equity Growth

Annual growth is just off the record rate but still flying very high for such a large debt pile. October’s numbers show the fourth largest annual rate beat only by the three preceding months. A single month of deceleration doesn’t make a trend but the sharp rate drop indicates there’s suddenly a lack of interest in this area.

The surge in growth comes after repeated warnings from the bank regulator. OSFI has found increasing evidence that indicates homeowners have been using their home equity to finance their lifestyle. This both hides their vulnerability as well as ties economic consumption to home values. It provides a greater risk when the surge is aligned with unsustainable home price growth like we just saw. Any economic shock or a home price correction can compound fallout to the economy as this problem grows."

How the app works

When the app is all set up the store owner can log into Printseekers fulfillment system and see recently placed Shopify or Etsy orders. After making minor adjustments and adding a design image to the ordered item the store owner/manager selects which orders to send to Printseekers for fulfillment.

More effective functionality compared to similar apps in the market

Within the app there will be the option to let Printseekers' system recognize a repeat order and with the user's one-time permission it will automatically send that order to fulfillment. Thus cutting out the order processing step for the store owner/manager almost completely.

This will be one of the key advantages of this system.

""This app is a big step into making the print on demand dropshipping business even more seamless"" says Andris Grinbergs the owner of Printseekers.com. ""In the print on demand industry the more everyday tasks a business can outsource the more time is left to focus on growing the business and increasing profits. This is what we wish for all of our clients.""

How to get the app

To download the app a person must visit the Shopify App store. It will be available for public download at the end of February 2023. If there are any questions in the process clients are always welcome to contact the Printseekers account manager directly and receive a reply within 24 hours: e-mail sales@printseekers.com.

Greg’s Predictions

Chase to make Ink Premier a real Ink card

In 2022 Chase introduced a new Ink Business card: Ink Business Premier. At first glance the card is fantastic. It earns 2 Ultimate Rewards points for all spend and 2.5 points per dollar for purchases of $5000 or more. But there’s one huge problem. Unlike the Ink Business Preferred card Ink Premier points can’t be transferred to airline and hotel partners or used for extra value towards travel. And unlike the Ink Business Cash and Ink Business Unlimited cards Ink Premier points can’t be moved to other cards to make the points more valuable.

Each year I throw in at least one prediction that’s really more of a wishful thinking than a real prediction. This is that. My prediction wish is that Chase will allow points to be moved from the Business Premier card to other cards that earn Ultimate Rewards points…. or allow point transfers to airlines and hotel partners. With either little adjustment the Business Premier will become very interesting.

Hilton Aspire annual fee will increase

This one is practically a gimmie. The Hilton Aspire’s $500 in annual rebates alone make this card’s $450 annual fee worth paying and that’s before accounting for the card’s annual uncapped free night 14x earnings at Hilton properties and automatic Diamond status. The card has always been a bargain but now that the Marriott Brilliant card’s annual fee has jumped up to $650 it’s only a matter of time before the Hilton Aspire costs more too.

Amex will make their business checking bonus even bigger

As I write this the standard welcome bonus for Amex’s business checking account is 60000 points. I predict that sometime in 2023 we’ll see an even bigger bonus. Maybe 80000 points? We’ll see! P.S. the bigger bonus may come with additional requirements.

Choice will announce end of Radisson Rewards Americas

In 2022 Choice Hotels acquired Radisson Americas. At the time of this writing Choice Privileges and Radisson Rewards Americas continue to operate as separate programs. My prediction is that sometime this year Choice will announce the intention to merge the programs. I don’t think the merger will necessarily actually happen in 2023 but rather that Choice will announce this intention. Bonus prediction details (which we may or may not know by the end of 2023): Radisson Rewards Americas will be discontinued in favor of Choice Privileges; Radisson points will be converted one to one to Choice Privileges points; Changes won’t actually happen until 2024.

Delta will make Diamond status worth pursuing again

Over time Delta has made Diamond status harder and harder to achieve. And until recently they made that status more and more desirable. In 2022 though they tanked the value of Global Upgrade Certificates (which is one of the best benefits of Diamond status) and they took away (for 2023 and beyond) an easy way for Diamonds to bring guests into Sky Clubs for free.

I don’t have a specific prediction here about what Delta will do but I predict that they’ll do something. They’ll make some modifications to Diamond benefits such that some of us who have given up on pursuing Diamond status will seriously consider it again.

Bonus Prediction: Hyatt’s category 1-7 awards will become more expansive (probably not until 2024)

With Hyatt’s Milestone Awards one of the awards for reaching 60 nights each year is a category 1-7 Free Night Award. When this award was first invented it could be used at any Hyatt worldwide. Since then Hyatt has introduced category 8 and categories A through F for all-inclusive resorts. Those changes have made the category 1-7 less valuable since there are now many Hyatt hotels where they cannot be used. At some point I think that Hyatt will fix this problem. My bet is that this fix won’t happen until 2024 or later but I’m putting this prediction in here just in case they address this problem sooner.

Nick’s Predictions

Virgin Atlantic will devalue Delta awards to Europe

Virgin Atlantic already tried to dump all of the Delta sweet spot awards once overnight and without any notice. Given how little award availability Delta seems to want to share with Virgin Atlantic anyway I think 2023 will be the year where Virgin finally devalues this sweet spot. Yeah they’ll get some bad press from blogs for a week or two — but at the end of the day if you raise the price on something that people couldn’t buy anyway it’s kind of like a tree falling in the forest right?

United will make partner awards more dynamically priced

United has been inching the program to be more and more Delta-like over the past couple of years. Awards on their own metal are highly variable already and I’ve been seeing less predictable variance on partner awards (albeit in small increments thus far). In 2023 I think United is going to make partner award pricing more dynamic / less predictable. That will be bad news bears — and I hate to be the bearer of bad news but I’m bearing down for the downward trending value of Mileage Plus miles.

Aeroplan will reach 50 airline partners

Air Canada Aeroplan has more airline partners than any program in the world. Given the speed with which they’ve been adding partners you may not think much of this prediction since I believe it would mean adding just 3 new airline partners in 2023 (I believe they are currently at 47 partner airlines). However when you already have forty-seven airline partners finding three more airline partners who can partner up with Aeroplan and then negotiating those deals is probably harder than it sounds. Still I think Aeroplan wants to reach 50 and I think 2023 is the year they do it.

Capital One will not increase the annual fee or decrease the $300 travel credit on the Venture X card

The Capital One Venture X card is arguably the best deal in ultra-premium cards. The Hilton Aspire card provides more value if you maximize the benefits but the Venture X makes it simpler to come out ahead of the annual fee between the annual $300 credit for purchases through Capital One Travel and the 10K points that come after renewal. Some would say it is ripe for devaluation (and indeed in late 2022 we learned that the card would lose Priority Pass restaurant access as of 1/1/23).

However I think Capital One is done messing with this one for a while. I imagine they’ll continue to run some interesting things through Capital One Entertainment and a couple of creative promotions for Venture X cardholders. I don’t think they will chance losing the momentum they have going in terms of excitement for the Venture X card by increasing the fee. After all they’ve now twice saved themselves the expense of having Greg as a customer so they can clearly afford to keep the Venture X around for the $395 fee for another year.

Radisson Americas points will become Choice Privileges points with a 1:1 conversion

Radisson already announced in an email to Radisson Americas members that in 2023 they would have new opportunities to use points for award nights at Choice Hotel brands globally. Ever since Choice completed the acquisition of Radisson Americas I think we’ve all expected that Radisson points would eventually be converted to Choice Privileges points.

Most guessing about this have said that the conversion would likely be something like 2 or 3 Radisson points to 1 Choice point. While I would agree that either 2 or 3 Radisson points to 1 Choice point would be an even value trade I think that is far too difficult to explain to the majority of their members. Those of us who follow miles and points intently enough to have a handle on the difference in value between a Radisson Americas point and a Choice Privileges point are clearly in the minority of hotel and airline customers – I just think that explaining over and over again to every Radisson Americas member who calls to ask how their points balance got cut in half is a customer service experience that they don’t want (and to which they probably don’t want to dedicate resources). The total outstanding balance of Radisson points probably isn’t so significant as to be a stretch for them to honor at a 1:1 conversion — and I imagine that they gain a lot in the simplicity of combining programs from an IT perspective.

This prediction might be a bit of wishful thinking but I see the conversion at 1:1 to be the path of least resistance and the one Choice is most likely to take.

The Amex points parade will get an “Everyday” float

Amex has been marching to the beat of its own drum throughout the pandemic years and that drum has been loud frenetic and rolling. We’ve seen incredible offers on the Platinum Gold and even the consumer Green card over the past couple of years — on both the consumer side and the business side (with the Business Green being the one exception perhaps).

However Amex has largely ignored its Everyday cards. The Everyday and Everyday Preferred cards have gotten pretty stale in an environment with so many cards on the market that feature better base earnings and hotter bonuses both in terms of category bonuses and welcome bonuses. While Amex has run incredible offers on most of its cards over the past couple of years we haven’t seen any exciting offers on the Everyday cards.

I predict that 2023 will be the year that at least one of the “Everyday” cards joins the points parade and steps up with a big new welcome offer a better earning structure or both. There just hasn’t been much reason to go after an Everyday or Everyday Preferred given how they’ve been giving away so many points on all of their other cards. It’s high time we see something exciting on the Everyday / Everyday Preferred cards.

Stephen’s Predictions

Airline loyalty programs will consolidate

In 2022 Qatar Airways unexpectedly said adios to Qmiles and joined Avios along with its pre-existing members British Airways Aer Lingus and Iberia. We have Air France and KLM both using Flying Blue. Lufthansa Swiss Brussels Airlines and more use Miles & More. My first prediction is that we’ll see further consolidation with airline loyalty programs. Perhaps that’s another airline offering Avios or someone joining Air Canada with Aeroplan.

IHG will announce they’ll do away with Ambassador and/or Inner Circle status

2022 saw the introduction of the revamped IHG One Rewards program. This was meant to align status and benefits across their brands so it’s a little strange that they’ve maintained Ambassador status for InterContinental stays and the Inner Circle program at its Kimpton brand.

Some changes are already on the horizon as Ambassador free weekend night certificates will no longer be redeemable at Kimpton and Regent hotels from January 1 2023. IHG has been cagey though on whether the Ambassador and Inner Circle programs will be kept only saying something vague like “we don’t have any announcements planned at this point in time” or something to that effect.

Whenever anyone uses phrasing like that it’s almost inevitable that a change will be forthcoming at some point. My prediction is that in 2023 IHG will announce that they’ll be ending the Ambassador and/or Inner Circle programs. I think it’s less likely that they’ll actually end the Ambassador program in 2023 seeing as people will have already paid for a year of its status and perks so an announcement in 2023 for a change in 2024 is more likely than a change in the same year.

Radisson points won’t convert to Choice on a 1:1 basis

Unless the merger is proving to be harder than they expected we’ll hopefully see Radisson Rewards Americas being folded into the Choice Privileges program in 2023. What remains to be seen is how Radisson points will be converted to Choice.

At the time of writing this prediction our Reasonable Redemption Values for Radisson and Choice are 0.34cpp and 0.68cpp respectively suggesting Choice points are worth double those of Radisson. When it comes to points conversion though I’ll stick my neck out and say that I think Radisson points will be converted on a 1.5:1 basis. The Choice Privileges program isn’t the most compelling of hotel loyalty programs so I’d be surprised if they convert them at a generous 1:1 ratio but nor do I think they’ll convert on a 2:1 basis either. I might come to regret this prediction though as a 2:1 ratio is certainly possible as it’d make it easier for Radisson members to do the mental arithmetic than 1.5:1. A 1:1 ratio is also possible to some extent as the optics of Choice saying “You had 100000 Radisson points but you now only have 50000 Choice points” might not be good. Now that I write that it does make me wonder if they will convert on a 1:1 basis after all but considering they’re a chain largely consisting of brands like Econo Lodge Quality Inn and Rodeway Inn placing a high priority on customer satisfaction isn’t necessarily a KPI.

Choice will run a Radisson brand-specific promotion

Provided the loyalty programs do merge in 2023 I imagine that Choice will want to highlight all its new brands to Privileges members. My fourth prediction is therefore that we’ll see at least one promotion offering bonus points only at brands that were formerly part of Radisson Rewards Americas like Radisson Country Inn & Suites etc. One possibility would be something like earning 500 points for each new brand you stay at but more likely would be a ‘Stay 2 nights at a formerly Radisson brand & earn xxxx bonus points.”

Bilt will add another transfer partner

Bilt has a surprisingly compelling list of transfer partners given the inclusion of American Airlines and Hyatt. In 2022 they added British Airways Aer Lingus and Iberia as transfer partners and I suspect we’ll see them continuing to add transfer partners in 2023. Qatar Airways could be one seeing as they also use Avios now another would be Singapore Airlines given their promiscuity with other transferable currencies. Maybe we’ll see a new partner that’s more out of left field though like Korean SKYPASS.

Marriott Bonvoy points will be worth a fixed ~0.55-0.6cpp

This is exactly the same as the prediction I made last year. Unfortunately for that previous prediction Marriott decided not to go all-in on dynamic pricing last year instead having some an anchor as to how much properties could charge for the first year of dynamic pricing.

They’re due to cast away that anchor in 2023 so at that point I still expect us to see their points being worth a consistent 0.55-0.6cpp with the opportunity to get outsized value being extremely limited. I’d be more than happy to be wrong about this but we’ve burned most of our Marriott points in anticipation of them being worth less from March onwards (March is when Marriott traditionally does its annual devaluation).

Side note to Marriott: it’s normally a good thing when customers know what to expect from a loyalty program. Associating a certain month of the year with when you’ll screw over your loyalty program members isn’t one of them so feel free to surprise and delight in 2023 rather than Bash Bother Blast and Bonvoy your guests with a substantial devaluation.

Airbnb will launch a loyalty program or credit card

The Expedia group is due to be rolling out One Key this year – a unified loyalty program for Expedia Hotels.com Orbitz VRBO and more. The fact that VRBO will be participating in a loyalty program might mean that Airbnb will finally feel pushed into launching some kind of loyalty program of their own.

If they do I wouldn’t expect anything industry-shaking. More likely would be some kind of revenue-based rewards program such as 5% back on stays. We tend to stay ~100 nights a year in Airbnbs so this might just be my wishful thinking that we’ll see any kind of loyalty program from them.

An alternate change could be that Airbnb will partner with a bank to launch a credit card. If they do it would probably be largely ignorable as I doubt the return would be very generous.

Barclays will relaunch the Arrival Plus card or launch a new transferable currency card

In November 2022 Barclays pulled what was perhaps the most random move of the year by adding the ability to transfer points to select travel partners on the Arrival Plus card (see this post for more about why that was so strange).

I feel like there’s got to be a reason they did that and in that post I suggested a couple of reasons. One is that they’ll be relaunching the Arrival Plus card and wanted transfer partners in place before doing that or they’ll be launching a brand new credit card with the ability to transfer to those same travel partners.

Delta will add another useful partnership

Over the last few years Delta has joined forces with a number of different – and useful – partners to offer bonus SkyMiles when spending with them. Starbucks Airbnb Instacart Lyft and Ticketmaster are all examples of that so my crystal ball says there’ll be at least one more useful partnership added in 2023.

“Useful” will be subjective but I’ll loosely define it as a partner which you could conceivably use frequently (e.g. Starbucks Lyft and Instacart) or less frequently but which can still be rewarding due to the higher levels of spend (e.g. Airbnb and Ticketmaster).

Something will go awry with at least one crypto debit card

I’ll admit – I’m not overly familiar with crypto debit cards as I don’t have any myself. I know that they’re popular in some circles due to the potential earnings which can be very generous if you have a way to generate a lot of spend on them without getting shut down.

There is risk though. With some cards you only earn at higher rates when staking money in certain coins. Some of those returns have been ludicrously – and unsustainably – high so I foresee returns dropping or lots of money lost due to the value of the coins either dropping or money just vanishing a la FTX.

One of the most popular crypto debit cards is the Coinbase-issued one. That offers 4% in some situations which for a debit card still seems unreasonably high (Nearside couldn’t even sustain 2.2% for a year). My understanding is that funds deposited in USD and USDC are FDIC-insured as it’s held with Pathward (formerly MetaBank). I personally wouldn’t count on funds held in USDC being worth the same as USD seeing as USDC isn’t fully backed by cash. A run on the coin could see it being worth less with potentially major implications for those counting on it for the Coinbase debit card.

I’m sure there’ll be people in the comments saying why I’m wrong about this or that with this specific prediction. I’d very much like it to be the case that people’s money will be safe and that there’s no risk with crypto debit cards but for me there’s just to much risk and I’m steering clear.

Tim’s Predictions

Citi will “venture” back into premium cards

Citibank will always have a place in my heart for offering what to me was the best premium credit card in the history of premium credit cards: the original Citi Prestige. The benefits were insane: $250 airline credit good for airfare as well as incidentals 4th night free on any hotel booking with the Citi Concierge Admiral’s Club access ability to redeem Thank You points at 1.6cpp on American three complimentary rounds of golf/year…it was a crazy deal. And it turned out that the answer to “what crazy thing did Citi do” was to design the original Prestige card. Benefits were slowly stripped away the card lost its welcome bonus and the only folks that have it now are legacy cardholders. Let’s just say Citi lost their shorts on the card and have been a little gun-shy since.

But that’s going to change this year. Citi has been investing a ton into thrusting the Premier card back into the mid-range Venture/Sapphire Preferred competition and I’m sure the popularity of Chase Amex and Capital One’s premium offerings isn’t lost on them. I think they’re going to try and muscle in for some market share in 2023 and we’ll see a $500+ annual fee Thank You Points-earning card again.

The Office Depot/Office Max/Staples 5x train will be partially derailed

Let me first say I DEARLY hope that I’m wrong on this one. Fee-free Staples and OD/OM deals are the engine that drives my Ultimate Rewards universe and the reason I have 4 Ink Cash cards (and will be adding a 5th shortly). But I’ve chatted with a few of the local GM’s and I think there’s trouble in the waters…as evidenced by the recent Staples offer of 5 $100 free-free cards per trip vs 8 $200 cards. It sounds like individual stores are not a fan of these promotions and see it as corporate trying to inflate sales numbers during the last couple of years (and they’re probably right). I think we might see both office supply chains putting the brakes on the UR machine this year. I don’t think that they’ll go away but I fear we may see the end of the $1600 of fee-free 5x/transaction and in its place we’ll find some coal in our collective stocking.

We’ll continue to see massive credit card bonuses…for the first half of the year

As a miles and points-earning year 2022 will be hard to top due in no small part to Amex’s points parade of “no lifetime language” offers….raise your hand if you have more than one Business Platinum (everyone can put their hands down now). But we’re through(-ish) the pandemic so that will change right? Not so fast. Issuers (and many other financial institutions) are reaping the rewards of higher interest rates and I think for the first half of the year the driving force will continue to be customer acquisition. That said we’re forecast to hit some economic bumps around Q3 this year and I believe that we’ll see two effects. First issuers will put more marketing money into attractive balance-transfer and flexible payment options and second they’ll get more concerned about taking on risky customers. As a result I think we’ll see the gaudy bonuses plateau over the first half of the year and then start to lower in the second half.

Marriott will devalue but it won’t be as bad as we fear

Ever since Marriott announced that it would be moving to a fully-dynamic award chart in 2023 many of use have been waiting for the Bonvoyage to reasonable redemptions. Throughout 2022 most properties have been held to a “band” that more or less corresponds to their previous positioning on the now-defunct award chart. The couple of hundred that haven’t been restricted have been ugly.

That said when Greg did his most recent analysis of Bonvoy points he found that they had actually increased in value if ever-so-slightly over the course of 2022. Now there have been some outsized redemptions in 2022 because of the “band restrictions” and I think the days of getting 1 cent per point (and above) are gone. But I’ve found that most properties seem to be stabilizing at around .7-.8 cpp and I think that’s more or less where the dynamic chart will end up…for now.

Bonus Prediction: The over/under on the number of free cruises that Nick will take in 2023 is two. And I’ll take the over.

Turns out Nick Reyes is a cruiser. This year Nick has been “diving” into the current sweet-spot of almost-free cruising and has come out invigorated and inspired. Indeed he’s been able to parlay a $95 credit card into multiple “free” cruises (less port taxes) and has found out that traveling in a giant ocean-borne RV with included food and multiple pools is pretty stellar when you have a couple of toddlers in tow. The deals are so good that Nick and Greg (who is an anti-cruiser) agreed that it was the “deal of 2022” on the most recent FM on the Air podcast.

Nick+gaming=synergy and I think we’ll see him unearth multiple options that will make our jaws drop this year.

05 of 15 Clear Utensil Drawer Dividers Marty Baldwin Clear acrylic drawer organizers are popular for a few reasons: They make it easy to sort your stuff they're easy to clean and they make it plain to see what’s inside. Place a variety of sizes in a kitchen drawer to accommodate longer and wider tools like a pizza cutter or basting brush. Smaller items like corkscrews and measuring spoons can fit into smaller inserts. Once you have them arranged the way you like place a bit of museum or earthquake gel onto the bottoms of the organizers to prevent slipping and sliding when you open the drawer.

06 of 15 Storage That Doubles as Decor Tria Giovan Photography When your storage containers are attractive you can’t help but show them off. Kitchen tools in the same color scheme or material make for a stylish display. Here a large crock holds wooden spoons and spatulas. Add a magnetic strip to keep knives handy and open shelves to hold your mortar and pestle collection.



07 of 15 Keep It Natural Marty Baldwin If you prefer a more eco-friendly way to get organized consider using bamboo organizers in lieu of plastic. The concept is exactly the same but the care is slightly different. Instead of removing the inserts and hand-washing them like you can with acrylic you’ll need to spot-clean bamboo organizers as needed. Still they can be a stylish and useful way to sort kitchen utensils including everything from your stand mixer accessories to your grilling tools.

08 of 15 Use Glass Containers Helen Norman Large glass jars are another way to contribute to the kitchen's style.

Glass jars are a simple timeless kitchen storage option and help keep baking supplies in one convenient location.

09 of 15 Pegged Drawer Compartments Peter Krumhardt Keep utensils organized and in place by installing wooden pegs within deep kitchen drawers. A pegboard at the bottom of the drawer allows you to rearrange the pegs to create different compartments. Pegs allow you to section off various areas for dishes silverware and accessories and prevent items from sliding around when the drawer opens and closes. Baskets and sectioned containers within the drawer are great ways to keep napkins and silverware in place.

As a result Mr Ong who has sold his current flat is storing its contents with storage service provider Lock+Store.

The 40-year-old who is married and has two children will be moving in with his parents-in-law while waiting for his new flat to be completed.

There has been a 20 per cent spike in inquiries for storage services in the last three months according to storage space provider Work+Store.

Delays in flat renovation are one of the reasons for this rise in demand said Work+Store chief executive Danny Wong.

“This is even more evident in the last few months as property transactions have increased and we have received a 50 per cent rise in inquiries from people who are looking to store their furniture due to such delays” he added.

Mr Ong whose sofa writing desk chairs and a king-sized bed among other items are now with the storage provider said he expects to spend at least $3000 on storage.

“It’s quite inevitable that you will have to store your items elsewhere as the process between selling your current house and receiving the keys to your new house could take between eight and 12 weeks” said Mr Ong.

“And you don’t know how long you’ll need to find the right buyer and decide on the selling price.”

A housewife who wanted to be known only as Ms Kathleen also turned to storage services in December 2022 amid her frustration over renovation delays.

Ms Kathleen 42 and her husband had bought a landed property and its renovation was supposed to be completed in November 2022.

The couple and their five-year-old son had been staying in a rental unit while waiting for their new home to be ready.

“However after constant delays from our contractor our new place is still not complete and our rental unit’s lease was up. So we had to move out and store our furniture with a storage provider” said Ms Kathleen.

Her furniture and other large items such as a refrigerator and washing machine are now kept with Lock+Store and the family is now staying at a relative’s place.

She added: “As my contractor has not provided an estimate of how long the renovation delay will be I don’t know how long I will have to store my furniture for.”"

The exit is part of a larger exodus by oil and gas companies shifting their focus away from aging offshore projects in West Africa to lower-carbon natural gas and LNG projects inland and more-lucrative projects elsewhere.

The operator has cut its output in the country to less than 15000 BOPD through existing production unit Serpentina according to the Reuters source. It evacuated staff from the offshore production platform Zafiro this year due to water entering the aging vessel.

ExxonMobil’s oil output in Equatorial Guinea peaked at more than 300000 B/D 8 years ago and has been declining since. It has been trying to sell its Zafiro operation since 2020 but with no takers the operator plans to decommission the floater soon. The company last year pumped about 45000 B/D in Equatorial Guinea out of the country’s total production of 93000 B/D.

These numbers represented a record for the Elon Musk -led automaker and growth of 40% in deliveries year over year.

Tesla started production at two new factories this year — in Austin Texas and Brandenburg Germany — and ramped up production in Fremont California and in Shanghai but it does not disclose production and delivery numbers by region.

Those more recent estimates were in line with a company-compiled consensus distributed by Tesla investor relations Vice President Martin Viecha. That consensus published by electric vehicle industry researcher @TroyTeslike said that 24 sell-side analysts expected Tesla deliveries of about 417957 on average for the quarter (and about 1.33 million deliveries for the full year).

According to a consensus of analysts' estimates compiled by FactSet as of Dec. 31 2022 Wall Street was expecting Tesla to report deliveries around 427000 for the final quarter of the year. Estimates updated in December and included in the FactSet consensus ranged from 409000 to 433000.

In the fourth quarter of 2022 Tesla said deliveries of its entry-level Model 3 sedan and Model Y crossover amounted to 388131 while deliveries of its higher-end Model S sedan and Model X SUV amounted to 17147.

In its third-quarter shareholder presentation Tesla wrote: ""Over a multi-year horizon we expect to achieve 50% average annual growth in vehicle deliveries. The rate of growth will depend on our equipment capacity factory uptime operational efficiency and the capacity and stability of the supply chain.""

The period ended Dec. 31 2022 was marked by challenges for Tesla including Covid outbreaks in China which caused the company to temporarily suspend and reduce production at its Shanghai factory.

During the fourth quarter Tesla also offered steep price cuts and other promotions in the U.S. China and elsewhere in order to spur demand even though doing so could put pressure on its margins.

In a recent email to Tesla staff Musk asked employees to ""volunteer"" to deliver as many cars to customers as possible before the end of 2022. In his email Musk also encouraged employees not to be ""bothered"" by what he characterized as ""stock market craziness.""

Shares of Tesla plunged by more than 45% over the last six months.

In December several analysts expressed concern about weakening demand for Tesla electric vehicles which are relatively expensive compared with an increasing number of hybrid and fully electric products from competitors.

Along with competitors ranging from industry veterans Ford and GM to upstart Rivian  Tesla is poised to reap the benefits of President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act this year which includes incentives for domestic production and purchases of fully electric cars.

Retail shareholders and analysts alike attributed some of Tesla's falling share price in 2022 to a so-called Twitter overhang.

Musk sold billions of dollars worth of his Tesla holdings last year to finance a leveraged buyout of the social media business Twitter. That deal closed in late October. Musk appointed himself CEO of Twitter and has stirred controversy by making sweeping changes to the company and its social media platform.

Shares of Tesla started to rise again in the final days of December 2022 in anticipation of record fourth-quarter and full-year deliveries.

Correction: This story has been updated to reflect the correct numbers for Model 3 and Y and Model S and X vehicle deliveries for the fourth quarter of 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNic25ld3MuY29tL25ld3MvdGVzbGEtY2FyLXNhbGVzLTIwMjItMS0zLW1pbGxpb24v0gFCaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuY2JzbmV3cy5jb20vYW1wL25ld3MvdGVzbGEtY2FyLXNhbGVzLTIwMjItMS0zLW1pbGxpb24v?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla posts record sales but falls short of goals,"Tesla said Monday that it sold a record 1.3 million vehicles last year but the number fell short of CEO Elon Musk's pledge to grow the company's sales by 50% nearly every year.

The 2022 figure topped the prior record of 936000 vehicles delivered in 2021 but it was shy of the 1.4 million needed to reach the company's 50% growth target. Sales grew 40% year over year while production climbed 47% to 1.37 million.

The shortfall came despite a major year-end sales push that included rare $7500 discounts in the U.S. on the Models Y and 3 the company's top-selling models.

Tesla Inc. which is based in Austin Texas also had to deal with rising cases of the novel coronavirus in China which cut into production at its Shanghai factory.

With the extra U.S. push Tesla delivered more than 405000 vehicles worldwide in the fourth quarter. But that missed Wall Street projections. Analysts polled by data provider FactSet expected 427000 deliveries from October through December and 1.33 million for the full year.

""A great 2022""

""Thank you to all of our customers employees suppliers shareholders and supporters who helped us achieve a great 2022 in light of significant COVID and supply-chain related challenges throughout the year"" the electric vehicle and solar panel company said Monday.

Tesla didn't roll out any new models last year and it's facing increasing competition from legacy automakers and startups such as Lucid and Rivian which are continually introducing new electric vehicles.

But Musk has promised to start producing the long-awaited Cybertruck electric pickup this year. The company also has started delivering its electric semis.

The discounts offered during the last two weeks of the year raised questions about whether demand was softening for Tesla products as the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to combat inflation.

That coupled with Musk's behavior after his $44 billion purchase of Twitter helped to push Tesla shares down more than 65% last year bumping Musk out of the top spot for the world's wealthiest person according to Forbes.

The company's stock decline for the year its worst ever was more than triple the drop in the S&P 500 which was down 19.4%.

Musk wrote on Twitter Dec. 30 that the company's long-term fundamentals are strong but ""short-term market madness"" is unpredictable.

Some investors are worried that Twitter has distracted Musk from the car company. Musk said last month that he plans to remain as Twitter's CEO until he can find someone willing to replace him in the job.",,,,,,,,,
FICO,Fair Isaac,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vYmFua2VyYW5kdHJhZGVzbWFuLmNvbS9oaWdoZXItY3JlZGl0LXJlcG9ydC1mZWVzLWhpdC1ob21lYnV5ZXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Higher Credit Report Fees Hit Homebuyers,"As if rising mortgage rates and high house prices aren’t enough homebuyers in the new year are going to have to contend with higher fees to obtain their credit reports. In some instances a credit report will cost 400 percent more in 2023 than it did in 2022.

According to the National Consumer Reporting Association the Fair Isaac Corporation – aka FICO – is raising its price less than 10 percent to a select group of about 46 lenders. The company is behind the FICO scores many lenders use to rate applicants’ ability to make their mortgage payments.

Six lenders will pay about 200 percent more and the rest will pay four times what they were.

Lenders usually pay to run a credit check and obtain a score for every loan applicant then collect the cost from those who pass muster at the closing table.

In a memo to lenders NCRA Executive Director Terry Clemans called the price hike “massive” saying “This is a paradigm shift in the pricing structure for credit scores.” He said that the change is being “dictated” by all three national credit bureaus – TransUnion Equifax and Experian – and FICO.

Free Refis?

To entice borrowers who fear being stuck with 7 percent interest rates on their mortgages some lenders are offering to refinance loans for free if rates should fall.

But borrower beware: Most lenders are adding the fees for a potential refi into the cost of the original loan. So your rate could be 0.25 percent or more higher than you might find at a competing lender.

The moral of course is to shop around.

Conforming Limits Pass $1M

Savvy homebuyers can lower their mortgage costs a tad by opting for a loan that will be purchased from their lenders by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac.

Loans acquired by the two government-sponsored enterprises can cost anywhere from an eighth of a percentage point to a half-point less than other mortgages. That’s because the investors who buy the GSEs’ securities believe that Uncle Sam will stand behind any mortgage that goes in default.

And starting next year buyers in dozens of high-cost markets throughout the country can borrow up to a whopping $1089300 and still catch the price break. It’s the first time the so-called conforming loan limit has passed the million-dollar threshold.

Virginia alone holds 18 high-cost counties while neighboring Maryland has five. New Jersey and New York contain 12 and 10 such counties respectively. Even Idaho and West Virginia have one high-cost county each.

The limit for most of the rest of the country will be $726200 in 2023 which is a 12.1 percent increase from this year’s ceiling of $647200.

Meanwhile the limit for government-insured FHA loans in high-cost markets also will be $1089300 in 2023 while the “floor” will be $472030. Government-backed mortgages are often considered loans of last resort for buyers who are unable to qualify for conventional financing.

Permits Double as Demand Sinks

Finally according to the Census Bureau a record 111000 new homes have been permitted but not yet started as builders face high mortgage rates and diminishing demand. That’s about double the normal level housing blogger Bill McBride points out.

Builders are also losing deals at an alarming rate as buyers cancel their contracts. According to John Burns Real Estate Consulting 1 in 4 sales were lost in October. And at the same time the level of houses currently under construction is at an elevated level with nearly a six-month supply underway at the current sales rate.

No wonder many builders are offering incentives and/or cutting prices to attract buyers. In November the National Association of Home Builders reports over 3 out of 5 builders were offering to buy-down mortgage rates pay all or some closing costs or hand out free options and upgrades. And more than a third were slashing prices.

But NAHB Economist Paul Emrath reminds us that those numbers are a far cry from the lengths builders went to during the 2007-08 financial crisis. In October ’07 nearly 60 percent of all builders had trimmed their prices by an average of 7 percent. So far this year the typical reduction is 5 percent.

Incentives on the other hand have always been part of the sales strategy when the market softens. During the 2007-08 crisis well over 70 percent of builders offered one or more freebies. In December ’08 a whopping 86 percent were giving something away.

While the math may not be ‘mathing’ like it should for many it’s good to have a grasp of these technical terms in order to know and grow your finances. That’s where people like Angel Rich-Jones come in. Big on financial literacy the entrepreneur has made it her business to educate others on the subject matter through gaming technology. The Sunday Gleaner had a heart-to-heart with the entrepreneur while on her honeymoon in Montego Bay Jamaica.

She grew up in the first black community in the US Kingman Park in Capitol Hill Washington DC as a chubby and highly intelligent child with bright aspirations of becoming an entrepreneur.

“I was always considered smart nice and giving. I was a chubby kid that loved puzzles botany and entrepreneurship. I dreamed of one day being successful enough to go on an extended vacation to Jamaica. I never imagined it would be my honeymoon or that I would do it in a bikini” she told us.

Angel Rich-Jones is no stranger to the finance world. In fact she started her first company when she was 11 years old. “That year I participated in the invention convention. And crazy enough my idea was to integrate technology into students’ desks so they could interact with the desk as a computer screen and print their work from the desk. I never thought I would actually own a tech company. My love for technology intensified after becoming a data scientist” she explained.

In 2013 she and her business partner started The Wealth Factory a business that has trekked an interesting journey of peaks and valleys “After I learned that people were so addicted to mobile games that they were walking head first into traffic I said ‘My God imagine if they learned something’. That’s when I decided to reverse-engineer the Fair Isaac credit reporting system and apply game mechanics to it.”

As the founder of Black Tech Matters and Fintech Rich-Jones is responsible for the creation of CreditRich an artificial intelligence app that is geared at improving your credit score. Partnering with credit report agency Experian puts her down in the history books as she is the first black woman to achieve an institutional collaboration of such epic proportions.

“Shortly after the wedding in February we found out that CreditRich an app that rounds up users’ spare change to help them pay their bills intelligently and raise credit scores effectively formed a partnership with VISA to launch the first ever black woman-owned neo-bank bringing the company valuation to over $1.5 billion UDS. The company is launching its own Visa Signature debit and credit card to offer account holders unique equitable banking and interest rates” she explained further.

So what inspired her to take this empowering route of freeing others from financial burdens and constraints? Her own journey.

She loved learning new things and was able to improve on her writing and speaking skills from high school. By the time she was in college she began to focus on perfecting those skills as a straight A scholar holding leadership positions in clubs. She even wrote and directed a film won case competitions and created profitable businesses. But she recalled a time swimming in a sea of college debt beyond graduation.

Being teased about her weight as a child was also something that Rich-Jones had to grapple with. So when she moved to Beijing for work she set out on a health and fitness goal losing 100 pounds during her three-month internship with the Republic of China. “I became the first black person and woman to within their foreign security help to assist with the 2007 Olympics. That’s where I discovered healthier eating patterns” she added.

Rich-Jones went on to get her financial start as a global market research analyst for Prudential Financial. With her eyes on the prize she dreamed of one day partnering with major financial institutions telecommunications companies and governments with the goal of improving credit scores in cost -effective ways.

She plans to further diversify the way in which people could go about paying fines exchanging funds and making donations with innovative solutions through the app. “The app is set to launch during Black History Month of 2023 in partnership with VISA and Experian to name a few” she added.

Noting that the biggest stressor on Earth is money the entrepreneur explained that it is important to be able to be lingual and functional in financial literacy. If she can help by providing the necessary tools then that is a difference she is proud to make in this world.

Already on this path of greatness she has been named by Forbes Magazine as the next Steve Jobs. This is a title that she dubs both accurate and honourable. “I think we are taught a false lesson to keep your head down and climb the ladder. Instead you should develop the skills and intelligence to be confident enough to aim straight for the top because the bottom is overcrowded. You must have guts and grit” she asserted.

And if Forbes wasn’t enough her husband Karl illuminated more on the light that is his wife. “I realised unicorns are real. A person shouldn’t have this much creativity compassion and pride but somehow you have that in addition to being fun intelligent God-fearing and refined” he shared in his vows.

The married couple who are familiar with the island enjoyed a beautiful honeymoon at Half Moon Resort in Rose Hall St James. The dynamic duo described the hotel as the diamond of the Caribbean. “ We loved every second of our honeymoon and will forever have a special place in our hearts for Jamaica.”

The Apple CEO met with the Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Dec. 15 to discuss the country’s potential regulation of app stores.

According to a report by Nikkei Cook was looking to reach an agreement that Kishida would consider the ramifications such regulation would have on Apple users if they are forced to use third-party app stores in Japan.

Cook and Kishida also discussed how Apple’s $100 billion investment in Japan’s supply chain over the last five years speaks to the company’s commitment to the country according to the report.

The two also discussed the potential for Apple to be involved in the creation of digital My Number government identification cards on iPhones.

According to Nikkei Cook expressed that he planned to work on the My Number IDs but also had strong reservations over user security if there is not strong regulation for Japanese iPhone users.

Representatives at Apple did not immediately respond to PYMNTS’ emailed request for comment.

Apple has opposed government regulation of app distribution for a long time as the company has said previously that third-party apps delivered from outside its App Store could put users’ privacy at risk.

The company recently has been facing the same struggles with third-party app stores accessing its devices in Europe with the announcement that Apple will allow third-party stores starting in 2024.

This came as a part of Europe’s Digital Markets Act which aims to boost the competitiveness of third-party app developers and allow greater choice to consumers.

User security also continues to be a priority for Apple with the company recently (Dec. 7) adding three new cybersecurity tools to help users protect their data in the cloud.

“We constantly identify and mitigate emerging threats to their personal data on device and in the cloud” Apple Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said at the time these tools were released. “Our security teams work tirelessly to keep users’ data safe and with iMessage Contact Key Verification Security Keys and Advanced Data Protection for iCloud users will have three powerful new tools to further protect their most sensitive data and communications.”

All three cybersecurity features will be available for Apple users in early 2023.",,,,,,,,,,,,

When most people think of electric vehicles (EVs) they think of plug-in stations and long charging times. But a new solar-powered car may change all of that.

The Dutch company Lightyear has announced that its Lightyear 0 model is being manufactured. The Lightyear 0 can charge literally any time the car is in the sun meaning while parked or on the go.

The vehicle which would be the first of its kind comes after years of innovation and development.

This insanely sleek EV can travel up to 43 miles a day solely from the solar panels on its roof meaning you could theoretically go for months without needing to charge it. And if you need to take a long trip the Lightyear 0 can still go up to 185 miles from an overnight charge.

Make no mistake: this is amazing news. While EVs are already making a dent in improving air quality especially in densely populated areas much of the electricity used to charge them comes from dirty energy sources.

These solar cars represent a solution to powering our transportation while the economy transitions toward cleaner energy sources. And considering over 25% of the U.S.'s harmful carbon pollution comes from the transportation sector using solar EVs could be an opportunity to make a huge difference.

Lightyear's Finland plant will produce the first thousand of these models and by late 2023 the company will ramp up manufacturing — quintupling its initial rate of production.

The Lightyear 0 is currently quite expensive though as the technology still isn't widely available. The model will cost about a quarter of a million dollars.

Lightyear is also developing a cheaper model which should cost closer to $32000. That car should be available by the end of 2025 Bloomberg reports.

The first Valley solar installation in North America last spring was on a quarter-acre in the corner of a pivot-irrigated field south of Davenport Neb. The size of this first installation is large enough to produce energy to power the center pivot operating on the land managed by Farmers National Co. This may be the first such installation in the U.S. but the Ag Solar team from Valley already has more than 700 solar installations worldwide.

Matt Gunderson FNC senior vice president of strategy sales and marketing says the installation of this solar project is an extension of the company’s efforts to help landowners improve sustainability and stay profitable.

Win-win for landowners

Farm Progress visited this first solar installation last fall and spoke with Gunderson and Jared Hodgson a FNC farm manager based in Hastings Neb.

Gunderson notes that the landowner invested in Tier 1 solar panels for this project which are the highest quality panels also used by major installations that are utility-sized. Tier 1 panels can handle extreme weather conditions including wind and hail and still perform.

He says the components and inverters in the system provide better than 94% efficiency in converting the direct current into alternating current energy that is sent back into the electrical grid. For the landowner it is a win-win because it uses less than a corner or farmland that is less productive to offset energy costs.

“Siting of these installations is very important” Gunderson says. In the Davenport project the installation was in a location convenient to farm around and adjacent to power lines making the connection to the grid much cheaper and easier.

If the producer wants to expand the installation to power the pivot and the well pump Gunderson says that it needs to be an additional three-quarters of an acre in size making for a 1-acre solar installation in all.

Increased efficiency

Solar power has been gaining steam for ag applications in recent years partially because of major gains in efficiency and affordability says Craig Bell director Center for Excellence — Ag Solar for Valley.

“Valley has a long track record in the pivot business and on the technology side of it as well” he says. “Our dealer network in the U.S. is providing solar solutions now for any ag application including pivots but also hog barns poultry facilities and others for instance. The pivots run during a portion of the year but other applications need power every day of the year offering more return on investment for our customers.”

The Valley solar panels are 400- to 500-plus watts. “The panel size and format hasn’t changed that much over the years” Bell says. “But compared to 10 years ago when the wattage was much less we are doing more with the same space.”

There are three main components including the panels structure and the inverter Bell explains. “The inverters themselves are relatively low cost and are of very good quality” he says.

Bell notes that solar panels in general have increased in efficiency by small percentages over time.

The partnership between Valley and Farmers National Co. for the Davenport solar installation represents a collaboration based on shared values of sustainability and environmental goals.

Since the company’s founding in 1929 FNC has valued conservation efforts as part of long-term sustainable farm management practices of their landowners Gunderson says. That’s why FNC is promoting the solar installation concept to landowners as a sustainable profitable solution for pivot corners and other marginal farmland.

The Japanese utility said it was forced to apply the measures in response to high solar radiation levels and low energy demand during the holiday period.

The control period will span from 8 am (GMT+9) to 4 pm and will be applied for at least three days depending on the weather and demand conditions the company said. It noted that the measure was applied from Jan. 1 when electricity demand reached approximately 669 MW against 738 MW of supply.

Okinawa is Japan's southernmost prefecture of Japan. According to the the Okinawa Times the prefecture currently hosts around 1400 solar installations.

In June Mitsubishi and Japanese utility Kyushu Electric Power Co. said they would team up to use grid-scale battery storage to reduce the impact of solar curtailment on the island of Kyushu in southern Japan.

According to Japan's Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies (ISEP) the island of Kyushu had around 10.5 GW of PV and 600 MW of wind capacity installed under the country's feed-in scheme by the end of 2021. The curtailment rate in the region for the entire year was estimated at around 4.4% up from 3.8% in the preceding year.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY21wLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jaGluYS1idXNpbmVzcy9hcnRpY2xlLzMyMDUyMzgvaG93LWNoaW5hcy1zb2xhci1wYW5lbC1wcmljZS13YXItY291bGQtZHJpdmUtcmVuZXdhYmxlLWVuZXJneS1pbnN0YWxsYXRpb25zLWdsb2JhbGx50gGRAWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2NoaW5hLWJ1c2luZXNzL2FydGljbGUvMzIwNTIzOC9ob3ctY2hpbmFzLXNvbGFyLXBhbmVsLXByaWNlLXdhci1jb3VsZC1kcml2ZS1yZW5ld2FibGUtZW5lcmd5LWluc3RhbGxhdGlvbnMtZ2xvYmFsbHk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China’s solar panel price war to drive renewable energy installations globally,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMikQFodHRwczovL3d3dy5zY21wLmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy9jaGluYS1idXNpbmVzcy9hcnRpY2xlLzMyMDUyMzgvaG93LWNoaW5hcy1zb2xhci1wYW5lbC1wcmljZS13YXItY291bGQtZHJpdmUtcmVuZXdhYmxlLWVuZXJneS1pbnN0YWxsYXRpb25zLWdsb2JhbGx50gGRAWh0dHBzOi8vYW1wLnNjbXAuY29tL2J1c2luZXNzL2NoaW5hLWJ1c2luZXNzL2FydGljbGUvMzIwNTIzOC9ob3ctY2hpbmFzLXNvbGFyLXBhbmVsLXByaWNlLXdhci1jb3VsZC1kcml2ZS1yZW5ld2FibGUtZW5lcmd5LWluc3RhbGxhdGlvbnMtZ2xvYmFsbHk?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E53B4550>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Engineering exercises in powerplant design which end up against a brick wall are being executed by major automobile manufacturers with programmed regularity. That is the surface appearance is that the projects end up against a brick wall. This view comes from those not closely attuned to the function of research and development. The job of probing the unknown untried and untested voids of engine design is immensely rewarding to a large company from the knowledge gained.

Very little if indeed anything is lost in producing an engine which is never mass-produced. Something is learned. The function of the exercise is served. Ideas are tested factored and catalogued for future use.

Ford — the third in our series on experimental engines — has their fair share of ideas conceived and nourished behind the ""closed door."" W. D. ""Bill"" Innes the progressive Vice President Manufacturing Group and one-time Chief Engineer of Ford's Engine and Foundry Division is the driving force behind Ford's experimental engine development programs. Innes opened this door and although he displayed a spectrum of engines that ranged from lawn mowers to stratified charge we concentrated our attention on the high-performance group. Some of the ideas seen here will reach the production stage; other experiments will be relegated to the files. This is to be expected. Production costs design flexibility reliability and serviceability are just a few of the criteria which must be met by a design. Weigh all of this as you peruse Ford thinking. Notice if you will how Ford engineering may run parallel to that of Chevrolet (December '67 HRM) and Pontiac (March '68 HRM) in some areas but be diametrically opposed on other points.

Bill Gay Chief Engineer of the Ford Engine and Foundry Division who was responsible for the design and development of the Ford racing engine which has brought home the gold from the Indy 500 for the last three years and Tom Landis Special Engine Engineering Department Planning were refreshingly candid in discussions concerning automotive powerplants of the future and. what had been discovered by Ford experimentation. Two points arose time and again. First that a three-valve-per-cylinder configuration is ""the way to go"" as long as two of the valves are used for intake and one for exhaust. They have also proven that four valves per cylinder are better than three. This theorem was backed up with complete (and impressive) air flow charts on a great number of cylinder head designs. As might be expected this thinking is manifested in some of the designs revealed here. Second that producing a quasi-production engine for competition which will fit into ever-shifting racing rules yet continue to win tends to age engineers at a rapid rate. A look at the Ford track record for the past several years indicates vintage may carry reward from the racetrack as well as the vineyard.

Single Overhead Cam 289

Those enchanted with the merits of the Ford small-block V8 will be intrigued with this exercise executed by Ford Special Engineering about the same time the 221 cubic inch engine was introduced to the public. The basic element in this experiment is a stock 289 cubic inch small-block engine. The water pump is spaced forward to obtain space necessary for a 1-inch-wide Gilmer belt used to drive one camshaft located in each cast aluminum valve cover. Camshaft lobes actuate cast iron rocker arms which force the valve open.

The primary purpose of the design was achieved — that of obtaining a higher more reliable rpm range from the engine. This it did. At one time thought was given to marketing the necessary components in a kit so the performance enthusiasts could convert the small-block engine to an SOHC configuration. The drawback to this of course is that there is no difference in air flow capability in the heads than with the stock 289 Ford. Thus any appreciable gain in performance from the camshaft arrangement was negated to a degree by restricted air flow. Further it was apparently reasoned that from any number of standpoints the idea was not worth pursuing to the point of incorporating a new head in the kit (and probably a new intake manifold) since in all likelihood pistons would have to be changed.

In short this is a prime example of the operation being a success but the patient dying. Dynamometer readings were obtained in the area of 300 horsepower. The operating rpm range was boosted to 6500.

Current status of the exercise: Experimentation in the area of belt-driven camshafts continue but there is no plan to further develop or market this engine or an SOHC kit for the small-block V8.

Three-Valve 302 SOHC

One of the most interesting aspects of this engine is that it has never been built. The picture is of wooden components mounted on a 302 shortblock. Primarily the exercise of constructing the mock-up shown here was to locate any problems which might crop up in fitting the engine in one of today's stock-chassis Ford products (like Mustang). This in itself gives some insight into the progression of a design experiment. Although the engine has not yet been constructed all components have been tested in operating powerplants. For instance the chain drive apparatus for the two camshafts mounted atop the heads is basically the same as that now being used in the 427 SOHC engines. The flow characteristics of the tunnel-port three-valve configuration are well-known since extensive flow work has been done on models of the three-valve 302 along with the tunnel-port two-valve and with the three-valve engine nicknamed the ""Calliope"" discussed further in this story.

Bill Gay and W. D. Innes of Ford Engine Division pose for theHRM cover shot. Sharing honors ofthe page is a belt-driven single overhead cam 289. Cast valve covers serve as cam containers. Valves are actuated by cast iron arms which bear against the cam lobes. Notice that cam lobes are drilled for oiling. The water pump is spaced forward to provide running room for the 1-inchwide Gilmer belt — a la Pontiac six. Don't raise an eyebrow. This engine had been run and shelved before the Pontiac six hit the showroom. The belt-driven SOHC design was trouble-free and dyno readings in the area of 300 horsepower were recorded. At one time a conversion kit was discussed — but the idea died aborning.

This engineering study was hung on the peg of developing an engine which might be used in sedan-racing events. However the current success of the single-cam tunnel-port 302 engine might very well mean this engine will never be built. The performance capabilities of a ""little brother to the 427 cammer"" are obvious. Production cost would appear a limiting factor with this design.

The Calliope

Conceived to win a race (Le Mans] built in a rush (but still ahead of schedule) the Calliope is an imaginative approach to a medium-cost high-performance large-displacement racing engine.

Built to 427 inches the engine was suddenly out of the running for the race by a ruling change which disallowed an engine of more than 183 inches.

The cast aluminum block is configurated for a unique over-under camshaft arrangement. Cast iron cylinder liners pressed into the block are finished to a bore size of 4.34 inches. Stroke is 3.60 inches. Main journal size is 3 inches; rod journals measure 2.5 inches. The intake camshaft lies 6 inches above the centerline of the crank. Pushrods for this cam are arranged parallel to the cylinder bore and actuate conventional rockers on a shaft arrangement. Four-and-a-half inches directly above the centerline of the intake cam lies the exhaust camshaft. Again mechanical tappets bear against large-diameter tubular pushrods which travel in a horizontal plane. Drive for both intake and exhaust cams is by chain and sprocket.

A dry sump oiling system is also employed with the sump pump driven from the nose of the crankshaft via a double-row roller chain and sprockets. Since the scavenge pump is capable of delivering 50 gallons of oil per minute and the shaft-driven pressure pump is designed for 20 gpm a negative pressure is effected in the crankcase. The crankcase is vented to the oil reservoir which contains the only breather for the system.

In order to shorten the engine for ease of installation in a race car two belt-driven water pumps are employed at the front of the block. There is no internal communication of water between the head and the block. Water flows from the block to an external fitting and then into the head. No head gasket is used — only large copper O-rings around the cylinders and smaller rings around studs separate block and head surfaces and provide sealing.

Combustion chamber design is pent roof containing two intake and one exhaust valve. Injector barrels are cast into the head. Modified Hilborn injection is used but provision is made for possible use of Tecalemit-Jackson injection.

A reliable 630 horsepower at 6400 rpm was obtained on the Ford dyno. The design is believed capable of 800 horsepower and an rpm limitation of 8000. A complete engine including flywheel weighs 577 pounds.

For a brief session of testing one of the two engines constructed was installed in a vehicle. At that time the discovery was made that 75 percent horsepower was reached in the first 15 degrees of throttle opening! Current status of the experiment: No further development or production is planned.

Indy Turbocharged DOHC

This is a further refinement of the Ford Indy 500 racing engine. However Ford is quick to point out that credit for the turbocharged version must be shared with Louis Meyer. At this writing A. J. Foyt and Mario Andretti are slated to drive cars powered by versions of a turbocharged Ford. Preliminary testing indicates 750 horsepower at 9500 rpm from the 168 inches of displacement.

Refining of the touchy induction system is to continue until race day in an effort to hold back a rising tide of turbines. Ironically the addition of a turbocharger muffles the cammer far below the level of sound produced by the engine in the normally aspirated stage.

Current status of the experiment: Racing association rulings on turbines and on turbocharged piston-driven engines coupled with the results of this year's Indy 500 hold the answer to future developments.

Hemi 429

The final engine shown on the cover is a 429 such as that used in the 1968 Thunderbird but with experimental cylinder heads. These heads have a modified ""twisted"" hemispherical chamber instead of wedge as used in production and the purpose of the engine is to evaluate some new concepts in chamber and port design. There are two valves per cylinder and they are pushrod-operated so this engine is not as unconventional as the wide rocker covers might indicate.

Currently Ford is proclaiming they have a better idea. Individual perusal of the engineering exercises revealed here by Ford Special Engineering should go a long way in adding credence to the slogan. Nothing we've seen appeared to have been run into a brick wall.

From left to right is a wooden and steel mock-up of a three-valve 302 SOHC. All components have been individually tested; this engine has not yet been built. Center honor falls to the evolution of a successfuldesign: the IndyDOHC. Fitted with a turbocharger and displacement reduced to 168 inches this engine cranks out 750 horses at 9500 rpm. Difficult to tame and tune this is the sole hope for fending off the turbines this year. Limited production is to begin soon on the twisted hemi 429.

He married a Kardashian. He divorced a Kardashian. He almost died.

Lamar Odom who has been in the spotlight for more than two decades recently sat down with TMZ’s Harvey Levin in an exclusive interview where he opened up about his former turbulent marriage to Khloé Kardashian his sex and drug addiction and the highly-publicized overdose that landed him in a coma.

In the special ""TMZ Presents: Lamar Odom: Sex Drugs & Kardashians"" airing Monday night Levin told FOX Television Stations that Odom wanted to open up due to the negative narrative surrounding the 43-year-old.

""He has a lot of regret and introspection"" Levin told FOX. ""He wanted to open up about that so we can move on and people could understand him better.""

The former NBA basketball player who previously battled substance abuse married Kardashian in 2009 but split from her in 2015.

""Khloé was the love of his life and he has a lot of regrets about what he did"" Lamar shared adding that Odom would be in a relationship with her if she took him back.

Levin noted that Odom hasn’t ""really"" had any contact with Kardashian since their divorce but ""would like to."" The former couple finalized their divorce in Dec. 2016.

After their split Odom famously went on a four-day bender and was found unresponsive at a Nevada brothel suffering numerous strokes seizures and two instances of his heart stopping.

""He insists that the day he almost died by overdosing at that brothel he did not consume those drugs voluntarily. He believes somebody tried to murder him"" Levin revealed.

Odom has previously alleged that the brothel’s owner Dennis Hof — or someone working for Hof — was responsible for his hospitalization.

Although he didn’t name Love Ranch brothel where he overdosed during the interview he has previously alleged that owner Dennis Hof — or someone working for Hof — was responsible for his hospitalization.

""I think Dennis Hof… I don’t know what he had against me but I didn’t do drugs that night to be honest with you"" he claimed on ""The View"" in 2019. ""So I don’t know if he tried to poison me or … I don’t know what he had against me. He tried to kill me.""

Hoff died of a heart attack in 2019.

Levin said he was surprised by Odom’s honesty during his interview adding that he has rebounded in a spectacular way.

""He was as honest as anybody I’ve ever interviewed. It was stunning to me"" Levin continued.

The special premieres Monday Jan. 2 (9:00-10:00PM ET/PT) on FOX.

He was born in Portland on Jan. 16 1937 the son of Edward E. and Mildred (LeGrow) Fox. Jere graduated from Falmouth High School in 1955. He attended Nichols College in Dudley Mass. and studied coursework in Forestry at UMASS and Business Management at Harvard.

After graduating college Jere began working for the family business N.T. Fox Co. Inc. and worked nights as a police officer for the Falmouth Police Department.

Following the death of his father Edward in 1972 Jere took over as President and CEO of N.T. Fox Co. Inc. (Fox Lumber) founded in 1922 by his grandfather Nelson Truman Fox and great-uncle Charles Fox. Under Jere’s leadership the business grew to four locations: Bridgton Kennebunk Brunswick and Portland. He remained in this position until the business closed in 1992.

He later obtained his Real Estate Broker’s license and sold Real Estate and also taught Real Estate courses.

Jere was never one to be idle. He continued working until just a few months ago when he retired from Pine Grove Cemetery in Falmouth where he was President of the Board and Treasurer.

He was a lifelong boater and outdoorsman. As a child he spent summers at the family’s home on Highland Lake and in later years at his camp in Rangeley where he enjoyed fishing bird hunting and snowmobiling.

As busy as he was when his children were young he always took time for family; whether camping skiing attending motocross and stock car races to watch his sons compete or sailboat races to watch his daughters compete.

His passion however was boating. A lifelong member of the Portland Yacht Club he served as Commodore from 1977-1979. Many weekends were spent traveling up the Coast or cruising Casco Bay with friends and family.

Jere was a longtime member of St. Mary’s Episcopal Church in Falmouth where he and Elly were married.

Over the years he was involved with many organizations. Most recent was Pine Grove Cemetery in Falmouth where he was Board President and Treasurer. In July of 2021 the Cemetery renamed their building the “Jere Fox Office” in gratitude of his years of dedicated service and thoughtful care he took of the grounds.

Other affiliations to name a few were Liberty Mutual Insurance Company – Advisory Board Maine Retail Lumber Dealers Assoc – President Northeastern Retail Lumber Assoc. Director Lumbermen’s Merchandising Corp International Fraternal Order of Lumbermen 32 Degree Mason Shrine Member Lions Club Kiwanis Club Falmouth Country Club Cumberland Club Falmouth Volunteer Fire Department Falmouth Fireman’s Association President and Falmouth Little League.

Jere will long be remembered as a devoted and loving husband father grandfather and friend. He touched many lives over his 85 years. Above all was his love and devotion to wife Elly. He made her his priority and despite his many health challenges in the past several years he never complained.

He is survived by his wife of 65 years Eleanor Fox of Yarmouth; children Steven Fox and partner Brenda Neal of Gray Dana Fox of Portland Stephanie Fox of Rangeley Angela Fox and husband Carl Higgins of Gray Andrea Fox Smith and husband Daniel Smith of Falmouth; grandchildren Adriana Fox Bean and husband Jordan Bean of Clinton Conn. Bennett Smith of Falmouth and Caroline Smith of Falmouth.

The Fox family wishes to extend their sincere appreciation to the doctors and nurses at Maine Medical Center New England Rehabilitation Hospital and the Gosnell Memorial Hospice House for their professionalism and compassionate care shown to Jere during the past few months.

Franchise players for professional teams in Arizona.

Same jersey number. They’ve led their respective teams to the playoffs.

Played college ball in the Southeastern Conference but there’s another connection who knew them way before they landed in the Valley to ball out for the Phoenix Suns and Arizona Cardinals.

Avery Johnson Jr.

“I’ve known Avery for a long time” Booker said. “We’ve been friends since middle school.”

Johnson Jr. met Murray in high school in Texas.

“That relationship has just grown ever since” Murray said.

Johnson Jr. is much more than just close friends with Booker and Murray though.

Not only is he connected to those two on a personal and professional level Johnson Jr. is a rising businessman making it on his own.

The son of former NBA player and coach Avery Johnson he has launched his own company Elevate Global a “full service and entertainment” vehicle representing athletes brands and entertainers.

“Just expanding into other lanes other businesses and other athletes” Johnson Jr. said. “Hiring people into the company so I use what I’ve learned from (Booker and Murray) and operate on a global level and using that and leveraging other clients and other players.”

Johnson Jr. 27 is just getting started.

“To watch his career go from basketball to what he’s doing now he was always a step ahead of everybody his age” Booker said. “He’s on the route to do big things. He already has. He’s somebody that his ear is always to the street. He’s always on the road. He knows what’s going on.”

Why aren't you in the guest room?

Having finalized partnerships and investments for Murray Booker and Detroit Pistons guard Cade Cunningham Johnson Jr. has created a company that will focus on “contract negotiation marketing representation brand representation business development and creating IP.”

He also is preparing to open a restaurant/lounge 40 Love in Scottsdale in “early 2023” in partnership with nightlife group H.wood which is based out of Los Angeles and has restaurants all over the world from Dubai to Toronto and throughout the United States.

“Just a cool project” Johnson Jr. said. “An exclusive spot that’s going to have A-list celebrities performances.”

The new nightspot in Scottsdale is backed by “global athletes and entertainers.”

Being in the sports world at an early age Johnson Jr. developed into a Division I basketball prospect was on the AAU circuit and found himself among the nation’s best talent at an NBPA Top 100 camp.

Booker also was there.

“We played against each other” Johnson Jr. said.

They’ve been really tight ever since. Avery Johnson remembers when his son and Booker were younger.

“I remember when Devin Booker was in high school and he was sleeping on the floor in Avery’s room and Avery was sleeping in the bed” Johnson said. “I remember like wow you know why aren’t you in the guest room? They just wanted to be together and train together.”

'From Day 1 they were like brothers'

Johnson attended Booker’s high school jersey retirement ceremony last month in Moss Point Mississippi but that wasn’t the first time those two have shared a special moment.

“When Devin walked across the stage to get drafted when his name was called Avery Jr. was there” said Johnson as Phoenix picked Booker 13th overall out of Kentucky.

Johnson Jr. and Murray connected during high school years in Texas.

They played in the same high school district in Texas. Murray was a phenom at Allen High while Johnson put in work at Plano West.

“Avery and Kyler from Day 1 they were like brothers” Johnson said. “I can remember when even Kyler was playing in high school coming over to spend some time with us they were inseparable. I think there was a healthy sense of respect because both ended up playing at a high level at Power 5 schools.”

Johnson Jr. and Murray started their college careers at Texas A&M before transferring. Johnson Jr. went to Alabama to play for his father while Murray landed in Oklahoma and won the Heisman Trophy.

“Tremendous amount of respect for Kyler and the Murray family” Johnson said. “They’ve been very consistent with Avery Jr. They’ve entrusted him. They believe in him and he’s a part of their inner circle which is not very easy to get into.”

Murray acknowledged the elder Johnson when talking about his close relationship with Johnson Jr.

“To help out with me be friends with my pops and my mom” Murray said.

'Really no surprise'

Johnson Jr. earned an undergraduate degree in marketing and Master’s in sports business management at Alabama. Not interested in playing overseas or coaching as he received offers to join staffs at Baylor and other colleges Johnson Jr. started exploring the business side of athletics.

“I wanted to go to the NBA like anybody else that’s played D-I you want to go that next level but once I saw that wasn’t really a path which was fine I wanted to stay around in sports” he said.

Johnson Jr. even envisioned working in a franchise front office but he’s found a lane that fits his ambitious mindset smarts and relationship building skills.

“I’m really proud of him because he’s understood the power of relationship and networking more than success and money” Johnson said. “He’s understood the power of relationships and networking from an early age and the power of influence. I can remember back when he was in middle school and he was playing sports but he was always business minded.”

Selling sneakers. Negotiating deals.

'A natural transition'

After his final season with the Crimson Tide in 2018-19 Johnson Jr. moved to Phoenix and started working with Booker as a day-to-day manager.

“It really was a natural transition” Johnson Jr. said.

Johnson Jr. said that job put him in contact with several people and companies.

Then when the Cardinals drafted Murray with the top overall pick in 2019 Johnson started running his management and brand.

“Once he moved out there I just pitched him on the plan and the brand and he hired me as well” Johnson Jr. said. “… Once he got to Phoenix it just made sense for me to work with both of them.”

Johnson Jr. served as a consultant for brands such as Overtime Elite that Booker has invested in as well as Warriors guard Klay Thompson and Hawks guard Trae Young.

Overtime Elite is based out of Atlanta and promises high school athletes six-figure deals if they skip college Sporting News reported. Hip-hop artist Drake billionaire Jeff Bezos and millionaire Alexis Ohanian the husband of Serena Williams have also invested in it USA Today reported.

Johnson Jr. played a role in Booker connecting with Overtime Elite as well as Murray joining FaZe Clan one of the largest esports and gaming organization in the world.

“For that friendship to continue into an entrusted business relationship really speaks to how they feel about one another and how they both have such a healthy sense of respect for each other’s skill set” said Johnson about the Murray-Johnson Jr. bond.

Johnson has also negotiated endorsements from Verizon Rocket Mortgage Buffalo Wild Wings Koia and Franklin Templeton.

“I have an assortment of deals I’m in” Johnson Jr. said. “I’m in healthcare tech business. I’m in the hospitality space. We’ve got the investments. The marketing the branding. I’m expanding out. Bringing my clients and my top guys into other deals that’s not just typical endorsement deals. Just branching out into other investments and investment groups.”

All these experiences have given Johnson Jr. the blueprint and confidence to launch his own company and expand his relationships with athletes and beyond.

“They know with Avery Jr. they have somebody who has a strong lineage of being a professional athlete” Johnson said. “He knows what it looks like. He knows the pressures. He knows the ups and downs. He knows all the ends and outs of it. He knows how to help you with your marketing. He knows how you have to train. He knows the commitment. He knows the type of friends you need to hang around and the ones you shouldn’t have in your inner circle.”

In fact it’s more of a smartphone accessory these days. They have tiny screens and many of the apps you use every day — Instagram Twitter Facebook — don’t have smartwatch apps. Most smartwatches don’t have LTE (or you have to pay a lot extra for it) meaning they can’t receive calls or texts when your smartphone isn’t nearby.

But there are many advantages to having a smartwatch. They show you who’s calling texting or emailing you without forcing you to look at your phone. They replace your need for a dedicated fitness tracker — because most smartwatches these days are souped-up fitness trackers. And some smartwatches look pretty cool. Whatever your lifestyle and which smartphone you use you’re bound to find something that suits you.

Not all smartwatches are the same however. Most fall between a fitness tracker and something that relays smartphone notifications to your wrist. Some smartwatches can work untethered completely autonomously from a smartphone — you can make calls send texts and navigate directions all while your smartphone is miles away. There are also hybrid smartwatches made by mechanical watch manufacturers like Tag Heuer Fossil and Withings that have sensors to track fitness and traditional watch battery that lasts months.

Before pulling the trigger on the latest Apple Watch (the Series 8) or a smartwatch by Samsung Google or Fitbit— do some research. Make sure it’s a smartwatch that’ll work to its full potential with your current smartphone and matches your budget and how you want to use it. If you work out a lot get a fitness-focused smartwatch. If you go off the grid get an LTE-connected one. Whatever your case make sure you know the basics.

Things to Consider Before You Buy

Compatibility: Not every smartwatch is compatible with every smartphone. Pretty much every smartphone manufacturer today makes a smartwatch (or several) that’s designed to work in the same ecosystem as their smartphones. They pair beautifully together and work with the same apps and services. This is why it makes a lot of sense for iPhone users to get an Apple Watch Samsung Galaxy owners to get a Galaxy Watch and Google Pixel owners to get a Pixel Watch. There are third-party manufacturers such as Garmin who make smartwatches for specific activities (like golf hiking or running) but you really have to want that for those options to make sense.

GPS or LTE model: Most smartwatches are available in either GPS-only or LTE (cellular) models. The main advantage of an LTE-connected smartwatch is that it can work completely untethered from a smartphone so you can make calls and texts and stream music independently of your phone.

No self-respecting digital nomad should be allowed to say those words. At least not in 2022 when iPadOS is still miles behind macOS primarily because of Apple’s walled-garden approach to the iPad app ecosystem.

But after spending well over $800 on the whole kit with the new Magic Keyboard Folio and Apple Pencil maybe I’ve downed the bitter potion of its cons and learned to love it. Or to put it more accurately be at peace with its limitations. Whatever way you put it this sleek tablet is impressive and infuriating to the same measure.

Performance champ middling execution

I’ll start with the performance aspect which has pushed the 10th Gen iPad towards a maddeningly weird bottleneck from various directions. On the Geekbench 5 benchmark test it actually finished the test before the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 and scored far higher.

The A14 Bionic – a two generations-old processor – put up 1594 (single-core) and 4187 (multi-core) in the CPU tests. Samsung’s best could only muster 900 and 3018 points on the single-core and multi-core tests respectively.

The performance gulf is also visible on the graphics processing side of things. On the 3D Mark Wild Life Extreme test the iPad again edged past the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1-powered Galaxy Tab S8 at both the overall graphics score and frame rate. metrics.

More importantly it proved to be significantly better at retaining high frame rates under stress with a less drastic dip in performance. In simple words you will come across fewer stutters and frame drops while gaming on the iPad compared to an Android tablet.

The iPad (2022) has all the firepower in the world to crush every single game and even handle video editing apps like DaVinci resolve. I had my video editor friend try some quick vertical video edits on the iPad and he remarked that this $450 tablet has no right to be able to do that.

That makes me wonder — why is Apple serving a watered-down version of iPadOS 16 on the 10th Gen iPad compared to the Air and Pro models? For example you don’t get Stage Manager on the iPad because it’s exclusive to the M1 and M2-powered tablets. It’s another day’s debate that even on those iPads it’s not a very rewarding experience.

I am not sure what exactly the compute and graphics requirements are for Stage Manager and for the ability to use it by connecting to an external display but it seems strange to me that the A14 Bionic isn’t powerful enough to handle it. I clearly remember WWDC 2020 when Apple proudly showcased a Mac based on the A12Z Bionic processor powering its shift away from Intel to its M-series silicon.

This company pulled off a monumental computing ecosystem transition and used the 2020 iPad Pro’s A12Z chip to show off its silicon chops but claims that the A14 Bionic can’t run a certain feature called Stage Manager. Alright maybe external display support is asking too much for a $450 tablet.

But at least Apple should’ve offered a diluted version of Stage Manager by limiting the number of apps you can run in the background cutting down on the animation work and a few other tweaks. Apple already plays this game with the camera capabilities on its Pro and non-Pro iPhones.

Implementing something similar on the software side for the iPad doesn’t sound implausible. I’d much rather have the user decide whether an experience is good or bad enough for them instead of never experiencing it in the first place.

Stage Manager however isn’t the only forbidden fruit for the 10th-gen iPad. With Stage Manager out of its reach one of the most troubling iPadOS 16 limitations also comes to the forefront — poor window management. There’s no free-form window resizing ability or overlapping windows.

There’s no concept of a focus app or quick access to those running in the background. The iPad so happily trounces the Samsung Galaxy Tab S8 at raw performance and yet the Samsung tablet handles window management and split-screen multitasking astronomically better than its Apple rival.

Pricey yet lacking goodies

Why build a whole ecosystem of computing products such as a far better keyboard folio with a godsend function key row when the software itself struggles to keep up? Plus that hardware doesn’t come cheap in typical Apple fashion. Apple wants you to pay $249 for its Magic Keyboard Folio case while the excellent Logitech Combo Touch costs just $160.

Discover What's Possible with Logitech Combo Touch for iPad

Despite being cheaper by a healthy $90 the Logitech keyboard races ahead in a few meaningful ways. First this keyboard is backlit. Second the kickstand offers more degree of angle adjustment. Third it has a rubber grip around the tablet part offering much better protection.

Plus there’s a neat loop at the top to hold the stylus. By the way if you also buy Logitech’s cheaper (by $30) Crayon stylus you will be saved from Apple Pencil’s $9 dongle hell too. Actually let’s forget the computing sins of the iPad and focus on the more tangible side of things.

Hobbled hardware

This is still the good ol’ iPad; a reliable video-watching machine. Unfortunately I don’t know a lot of people that watch a movie on an iPad with its speakers blasting at full volume not at home with people around and certainly not in public places.

A 3.5mm headphone jack seems fundamentally crucial to the “perfect multimedia machine” image of the iPad and yet it’s missing. I know we live in the era of Bluetooth earbuds but only the expensive ones can last you about four or more hours on a single charge.

But even these pricey earbuds have a very real battery degradation problem. My two-year-old AirPods can barely last two hours on a single charge which is not enough to watch a James Cameron movie and definitely not worthy of a Netflix binge-watching session.

Should you then spend $179 to get new longer-lasting AirPods 3 to justify the iPad’s “media consumption machine” creds? I would advise against doing that. Bring back the era when I could plug in my $30 JBL earphones into my phone tablet and PC!

Let’s talk a bit about the display too. It’s bigger this time but it’s non-laminated. There’s a gap between the top glass layer and the display elements underneath. It feels plasticky and there’s a noticeable flex when you press it as you inch closer to the center. I haven’t noticed such quality compromises on a $300 Android tablet from a Chinese brand.

A non-laminated display also delivers a sub-par stylus experience. You might not feel it right away but once you experience the fluid feel of scribbling on the iPad Pro or Air you will notice a sense of lag and trailing while sketching on the 10th-gen iPad. Also the stylus compatibility is limited to the first-gen Apple Pencil and the charging situation here is absolutely horrendous.

The lack of a good anti-glare coating means it’s a little too reflective and that’s really annoying. Plus the raw brightness output isn’t high enough to compensate for that. Moreover it’s easy to notice the brightness shift when looking at the screen from different angles.

This could have been a great tablet

I’ve extensively used the iPad over the past few weeks pushing it in every way I can. But despite all its goodness the compromises and wilful omissions made by Apple keep me from loving and recommending this machine. Of course Apple likely sold it by the bucketload this holiday season but it’s getting harder to recommend the vanilla iPad with each passing generation.

For all its promises Apple appears to be the 10th-gen iPad’s own worst enemy. The hardware situation can’t be fixed but I dearly hope that Apple can redeem it in the coming months with some meaningful software-side upgrades.

The big attention-grabber among LG’s CES announcements is a Brightness Booster Max feature for its G3 “gallery” line that ups peak light output 70% over conventional OLED models something it achieves using a combination of hardware design and a light boosting algorithm.

Starting from the top the new OLED lineup consists of the flagship Z3 (8K) and G3 series the mid-range C3 series and the entry level B3 series. (The A series LG’s previous entry level has been axed from the company’s 2023 OLED line.)

The Z3 G3 and C3 sets will all have OLED Dynamic Tone Mapping Pro a new feature that intelligently distributes brightness and color mapping over 20 blocks. They will also have the new HDR Expression Enhancer a feature that provides object-based tone mapping along with object-based sharpness enhancing. AI Super Upscaling with genre and scene detection will be found across all models which are specced for 100% DCI-P3 color volume coverage.

LG’s AI-based picture improving sorcery is the result of new processors found throughout the lineup with the G3 and C3 sets getting the a9 AI processor 4K Gen6 (a9 AI processor 8K Gen6 on the Z3) and the B3 getting the a7 AI processor 4K Gen6.

All of the new OLEDs for 2023 are fully specced for gaming and feature 120Hz VRR FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync. The top three series all come with four HDMI 2.1 ports while the B2 series will have two HDMI 2.1 ports. LG's 2023 OLEDs are also the first TV to be certified for Quick Media Switching VRR (QMS-VRR) a feature that eliminates the 'black screen"" that occurs when switching between different HDMI-connected sources.

Z3 and G3 models will additionally be outfitted with an ATSC 3.0 tuner for pulling in over-the-air next-gen digital broadcasts in the US.

LG’s G3 and C3 models will be lighter than their predecessors owing to a composite fiber material used for the panel housing. The decor-friendly G3 models will also feature a new Zero Gap design that LG says will allow the TV to be “perfectly harmonized with the wall to become one with it.”

Audio features too get an upgrade in LG’s 2023 OLED TVs. A WOW Orchestra feature allows for smooth integration between an LG soundbar and the TV’s built-in speakers while a WOW Interface lets viewers configure soundbar audio settings on the TV’s screen. As we had predicted for LG’s next generation of OLEDs the TVs will be capable of making a wireless lossless audio connection with the company’s soundbars a feature LG calls WOW Cast.

LG’s C series models will further be getting an optional bracket designed to mount a soundbar beneath the set’s screen when it’s wall-mounted.

webOS: the next generation

The webOS smart TV interface will be seeing a number of changes on LG’s TVs for 2023. LG’s Home hub shows recommended content for individual profiles which can now be customized with avatars. Support for the Matter smart home standard is being added and an optional LG smart cam accessory will be available to work with fitness and other lifestyle apps.

Built-in mics for hands-free voice control is a new feature for 2023 (Z G and C series models) and LG’s multi-view feature is being enhanced to support inputs from multiple HDMI sources.

Setup features in the new TVs will include a personalized Picture Wizard that uses AI deep learning technology to learn your preferences. This will involve six steps where you select aspects of different onscreen images and the TV will then analyze that information and apply it to picture presets.

Roberts Jr. does the honors. In others it might be Justice Sonia Sotomayor or Justice Clarence Thomas presenting the squared-off hunks of marble affixed with the Supreme Court’s gilded seal.

Hewed from slabs left over from the 1930s construction of the nation’s high court and handed out in its magnificent Great Hall they are a unique status symbol in a town that craves them. And while the ideological bents of the justices bestowing them might vary there is one constant: All the recipients have given at least $5000 to a charity favored by the justices and more often than not the donors have a significant stake in the way the court decides cases.

The charity the Supreme Court Historical Society is ostensibly independent of the judicial branch of government but in reality the two are inextricably intertwined. The charity’s stated mission is straightforward: to preserve the court’s history and educate the public about the court’s importance in American life. But over the years the society has also become a vehicle for those seeking access to nine of the most reclusive and powerful people in the nation. The justices attend the society’s annual black-tie dinner soirees where they mingle with donors and thank them for their generosity and serve as M.C.s to more regular society-sponsored lectures or re-enactments of famous cases.

The society has raised more than $23 million over the last two decades. Because of its nonprofit status it does not have to publicly disclose its donors — and declined when asked to do so. But The New York Times was able to identify the sources behind more than $10.7 million raised since 2003 the first year for which relevant records were available.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmR2aWRzaHViLm5ldC9uZXdzLzQzNzY1NC91cy1uYXZ5LXNhaWxvcnMtYXNzaWduZWQtdXNzLWlkYWhvLXN1Ym1hcmluZS12aXNpdC1pZGFob9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,U.S. Navy Sailors assigned to the USS IDAHO submarine visit Idaho,"Photo By Master Sgt.

Idahoans from across the state welcomed a contingent of the first U.S. Navy Sailors assigned to the USS IDAHO SSN 799 nuclear powered attack submarine. The USS Idaho Commissioning Committee sponsored the six Sailors’ weeklong tour during the last week in January to the Gem State to encourage them to become familiar with all things Idaho.



Idahoans welcomed Lt. Commander Darrell Smith Master Chief Petty Officer Travis Skipper Lt. Beckett Lemley Machinist Mate 1st Class Justin Teal Information Technology 2nd Class Peyton Freck and Machinist Mate 3rd Class Gianni Luzzetti across the state.



The Idaho Steelheads recognized the six crewmembers out on the ice during Wednesday’s hockey game and Idahoans got a chance to meet the Sailors at the McCall Winter Carnival. The Sailors spent some time on Gowen Field and met with the Idaho National Guard leadership. Additionally the crew visited with the late Medal of Honor recipient Art Jackson’s wife Sally Jackson; visited the Idaho State Veterans Cemetery; toured the Idaho Veterans Garden in Caldwell; spoke at school assemblies; attended the USS IDAHO Night at the Boise State University basketball game; visited Idaho Legislature and were introduced to a session of the Idaho State Senate and much more throughout the week.



The purpose of the visit to Idaho is to familiarize the Sailors with the state of Idaho and to establish a bond between Idaho’s citizens and the Sailors who will take the USS IDAHO to sea as a crucial part of the nation’s military strategy.



The future USS IDAHO is a leading-edge Virginia Class nuclear-powered fast attack submarine currently being built by General Dynamics Electric Boat in Connecticut. According to the USS Idaho Commissioning Committee the submarine will be christened this fall and commissioned into the Navy fleet in the fall of 2024."

Pet food and treat sales declined slightly for General Mills in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 although operating profits increased 34% compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. General Mills pet segment sales were US$592.9 million in Q2 FY23 compared with US$593.4 million during the same period of the previous fiscal year. However General Mills’ pet food sales increased by 8% when considering the six months ending Nov. 27 2022.

In 2021 General Mills purchased Tyson Foods pet treats business for approximately US$1.2 billion. In 2018 General Mills acquired premium pet food company Blue Buffalo. General Mills pet segment’s annual revenue reached US$1732000 in 2021 according to Petfood Industry’s Top Companies Current Data.

General Mills' pet segment performance

“Organic net sales were flat. Net sales performance was negatively impacted by a reduction in retailer inventory with all-channel retail sales up high single digits in the quarter” General Mills representatives said on Dec. 20 in a press release. “Excluding the retailer inventory change net sales results were broadly in line with company expectations and reflected continued strength of the Blue Buffalo brand partially offset by a short-term headwind from capacity constraints and related customer service challenges. Pet net sales performance is expected to accelerate in the second half of fiscal 2023 due to increased capacity improved customer service increased brand-building investment and an expectation for stable retailer inventory levels.

“Segment operating profit totaled US$87 million compared to US$132 million a year ago driven primarily by high-teens input cost inflation a significant increase in costs related to capacity expansion and supply chain disruptions and lower volume including the impact of the retailer inventory reduction. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix.

“Through six months Pet segment net sales increased 8 percent to $1.2 billion including a 2-point benefit from the pet treats acquisition. Organic net sales were up 6 percent. Segment operating profit was down 15 percent to $210 million driven primarily by higher input costs lower volume and higher SG&A expenses partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix.

“During the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we acquired the pet treats business for US$1.2 billion in cash. We financed the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and short-term debt. We consolidated the pet treats business into our consolidated balance sheets and recorded goodwill of US$762 million indefinite-lived intangible assets for the Nudges Top Chews and True Chews brands totaling US$330 million in aggregate and a finite-lived customer relationship asset of US$40 million. The goodwill is included in the Pet segment and is deductible for tax purposes. The pro forma effects of this acquisition were not material.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYmFsbGVyYWxlcnQuY29tL3Byb2ZpbGVzL2Jsb2dzL2dlbmVyYWwtbWlsbHMtaW50cm9kdWNlcy1zbW9yZXMtZmxhdm9yZWQtbHVja3ktY2hhcm1zLWFuZC1ob3Qtd2hlZWxzLWNlcmVhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,General Mills Introduces S'mores Flavored Lucky Charms and Hot Wheels Cereal,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='balleralert.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /profiles/blogs/general-mills-introduces-smores-flavored-lucky-charms-and-hot-wheels-cereal/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E5D42170>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMic2h0dHBzOi8vYmFsbGVyYWxlcnQuY29tL3Byb2ZpbGVzL2Jsb2dzL2dlbmVyYWwtbWlsbHMtaW50cm9kdWNlcy1zbW9yZXMtZmxhdm9yZWQtbHVja3ktY2hhcm1zLWFuZC1ob3Qtd2hlZWxzLWNlcmVhbC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJha2luZ2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy81ODEwOS1zbGlkZXNob3ctY2VyZWFsLWFuZC1icmVha2Zhc3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Slideshow: Cereal and breakfast,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJha2luZ2J1c2luZXNzLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlcy81ODEwOS1zbGlkZXNob3ctY2VyZWFsLWFuZC1icmVha2Zhc3TSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E5D41660>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

And naturally everyone is now hoping that summer will be back sooner than it is supposed to be.

SUV

EV

Old-school logic dictates that when possible one should prepare for summer rides during winter and vice versa. And the same applies to both the automotive industry and the imaginative realm of virtual car artists – especially when the latter are of the OEM variety.But there is no need to take our word for granted as we have yet another proper example. As such the General Motors Design Center’s social media page has a fresh “minty” ideation sketch that would make everyone dream of “sunny days and open-top cars” not just the peeps in Michigan. It arrived courtesy of a pixel master only known by his bbkil alias on Instagram and certainly made GM enthusiasts fantasize about it turning into reality.This ideation for a future convertible does have some interesting characteristics indeed. It certainly looks like premium sports car material so the badge hints can only lead to one possible conclusion for the builder – and that would be Cadillac . Next there are no perceived exhaust outlets – so maybe this is something that would bode well alongside the Lyriq electric crossoverand the Celestiqflagship.Plus the nimble convertible sports car styling gives us just one other possible question: is Cadillac ready for a potential XLR revival ? As a reminder the latter arrived for the 2004 model year as the successor to the quirky Pininfarina-designed Cadillac Allanté. And although it survived only until the 2009MY as the premium counterpart of the Chevy Corvette its Northstar V8 heart certainly earned it the right to a restrained cult following.Enough so that both real-world collectors and pixel masters have sometimes fallen in love with it. But now this ideation sketch comes directly from the General Motors Design Center’s vaults. So maybe it would be a great time to get hyped.Well frankly and speaking from experience – not really no. This is simply because their social media channel sure loves to toy around with both the hearts and minds of fans presenting them with cool stuff like a ‘Square Body’ next-gen Silverado truck  a hot Buick (Electra) four-door or sporty CUVs that make people wonder if they see the hypothetical Camaro CUV.But then unfortunately these are all merely wishful thinking – and nothing usually comes from people hoping General Motors will heed their advice and build it. As such no matter how many people think this would be great as an XLR successor an Eldorado revival or even as a simple “Cadillac EV boulevard cruiser” we are probably just going to dream about what could have been…"

Pumphrey also will serve on the board of directors of the company.

Pumphrey replaces Andreas S. Weller who left Aludyne at the end of 2022 to pursue an opportunity outside of the automotive industry.

Pumphrey brings extensive experience in the automotive industry having enjoyed a 38-year career serving global component manufacturers in senior executive roles since 2000. His most recent position was EVP and president at Cooper Standard in charge of the company’s $3 billion global automotive business. Prior to joining Cooper Standard in 2011 Pumphrey held senior executive positions at Tower International Lear Corp. and UT Automotive. He began his career at General Motors after earning his MBA from the University of Michigan in 1984 and a BA in 1982 from Kenyon College.

“I am excited to join the Aludyne team and to help the company achieve its fullest potential Pumphrey said. “Aludyne is well-positioned to benefit from the lightweighing needs of the global automotive industry and has the team capable of providing the highest quality products in the most cost effective and safest way possible.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Roche Holding (RHHBY 0.16%) and Gilead Sciences (GILD 2.14%) both saw increased sales during the pandemic due in part to their COVID-19 products. For Gilead it was its COVD-19 antiviral Veklury and for Roche its revenue was boosted mostly by coronavirus tests.

Now the large-cap drug companies are looking for growth beyond COVID-19 sales. Gilead's shares have glittered in 2022 with the stock up more than 16% while Roche's have fallen more than 23% so far this year. The question is which healthcare stock is the better buy now?

Oncology HIV therapies give Gilead an edge

Gilead reported third-quarter revenue of $6.99 billion down 5% year over year and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.42 down from $2.05 in the third quarter of 2021. Through nine months Gilead's revenue of $19.9 billion represents a drop of 1% over 2021.

The combination of the stock's rise and declining revenue has made Gilead a little pricier as it trades for 32 times earnings. In the long run however there's reason for optimism because if you take out Veklury sales from the equation the company's third-quarter revenue would have been up 11% over the same period last year. The company also has an active pipeline including 15 ongoing phase 3 trials.

The company's growing stable of HIV and oncology therapies should continue to drive the company's sales. HIV therapy sales rose 7% year over year to $4.5 billion and the company just got approval on Dec. 22 from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for Sunlenca as a twice-yearly treatment for multidrug-resistant HIV.

The company's third-quarter oncology sales rose 79% year over year led by three cell therapies: Trodelvy Yescarta and Tecartus. Breast cancer drug Trodelvy saw sales of $180 million up 78% over the same period last year. Yescarta used to treat large B-cell lymphoma saw sales climb 81% year over year to $318 million and Tecartus which has been approved to treat relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma saw sales rise to $81 million up 78% over the same period last year.

Gilead raised its quarterly dividend by 2.8% this year to $0.73 per share equaling a yield of around 3.45% nearly double that of the S&P 500 average. The company has raised its dividend every year since it began offering one in 2015.

Roche is priced at a discount

Roche's growing portfolio and pipeline of oncology and immunology drugs sets it apart. In December the company got two key approvals for Hemlibra and Lunsumio.

Hemlibra already approved by the FDA to treat hemophilia A with inhibitors was approved in Europe to expand that label to treat moderate hemophilia A patients without factor VIII inhibitors on Dec. 16. It's likely that an FDA approval for that indication will follow.

Lunsumio a bispecific antibody was given FDA approval on Dec. 23 to treat adults with relapsed or refractory follicular lymphoma who have had two or more types of previous therapies. The drug is also in several clinical trials as a combination and monotherapy to treat various B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and other blood cancers. Follicular lymphoma is the most common form of slow-acting non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

The Swiss pharmaceutical company which trades for around 16 times earnings is making up for lost sales from its COVID-19 therapy. Revenue for the third quarter was $25.5 billion down 7% year over year but through nine months it reported revenue of $50.69 billion compared to $50.36 billion in the same period last year. Nine-month diagnostic sales were $14.9 billion up 4% over the same period last year.

Pharmaceutical sales were flat at $33.2 billion but the company saw increased sales for Hemlibra (up 28% year to date) multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus (up 27%) spinal muscular atrophy drug Evrysdi (up 101%) and Phesgo a breast cancer therapy whose sales are up 150% over the first nine months of 2022.

It's also seeing strong sales from eye drug Vabysmo which launched at the beginning of this year. Plus the company has a large late-stage pipeline with 17 phase 3 studies expected to conclude in 2023.

Roche has an above-average dividend which it raised by 1.6% this year to $1.24 per share representing a yield of around 1.97%.

Sometimes the choice is difficult

Both stocks seem to be finding replacements for lost COVID-19 sales but of the two Roche seems to be the better buy right now. With a price-to-earnings ratio of 16.6 it trades for nearly half the P/E that Gilead does. On top of that Roche has a few more late-stage therapies in its pipeline and through nine months has already seen a revenue improvement year over year.

The one advantage Gilead has is a better dividend yield but that's not enough to make up for declining revenue numbers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiKGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNtYWpvcGVuLmNhL2NvbnRlbnQvMTEvMS9FMjTSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cost-effectiveness modelling of birth and infant dose vaccination against hepatitis B virus in Ontario from 2020 to 2050,,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXBoYXJtYWxldHRlci5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8yMDIyLXBoYXJtYWNldXRpY2FsLW0tYS10YWJsZdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,2022 turns out to be another unspectacular year for pharma and biotech M&A,"By Barbara Obstoj-Cardwell.

Data Pre-processing

Time Series K-means with DTW distance function to group stocks basis their Adjusted Close prices. The said prices differ vastly in their magnitudes while for this analysis we are only concerned with the shape of the rebound trajectory of prices. The stock price data has been scaled to zero mean and unit variance to overcome this. Also the analysis period has been restricted from 2018 to Nov 2022 along with removing stocks with NAN values.

close_prices = stock_prices[""Adj Close""]

Will Sectors serve as a good clustering?

Because stocks from the same sectors exhibit substantial similarity one might argue that the Sector information presents an intrinsic notion of clustering. While this argument has some merit EDA reveals that this clustering cannot capture similarities across sectors say Health Care and IT.

scaled IT sector (top) vs health(bottom)

The delta in the graph above is the difference in average value between February 2nd 2020 and June 30th 2020.

Another demerit of using sector information as clusters is that some sectors present huge variability in rebound trajectories for ex: Industrials.

Due to high computing requirements the final clustering has been performed on kaggle kernel. The optimal number (8) of clusters has been found from the elbow plot of inertia.

The crosstab of the Clustering vs the Sector information is given below:

Sector 0 is dominated by Healthcare/IT while Cluster 1 by Consumer Discretionary/Industrials

Deep-dive into a few clusters:

Cluster 0 | 153 stocks:

Stocks in cluster 0 on average show a shallow drop at the onset of covid but by June 2020 they have almost resurfaced to pre-pandemic levels. Also following Covid these stocks have shown strong growth and resurgence.

Cluster 0 regained almost all the hit between Feb 2020 and Jun 2020

The delta in the graph above is the difference in average value between February 2nd 2020 and June 30th 2020.

The top sub-sectors in cluster 0 include:

Health Care Equipment (11 stocks)

Semiconductors (8 stocks)

Financial Exchanges & Data (6 stocks)

Application Software (6 stocks)

Life Sciences Tools & Services (6 stocks)

Cluster 1 | 34 stocks:

Because of the economic slowdown accompanying covid consumer spending and travel took a hit. Consequently cluster 1 which is dominated by these sectors has seen a significant drop during covid. Most of the stocks in this cluster continue to suffer from this shock and with the onset of other economic crises like the Ukraine war they continue to oscillate below their pre-pandemic price levels.

Cluster 1 suffers from the Covid drop even till now

The delta in the graph above is the difference in average value between February 2nd 2020 and June 30th 2020.

The top sub-sectors in the cluster include:

Airlines (5 stocks)

Biotechnology (3 stocks)

Hotels Resorts & Cruise Lines (3 stocks)

Office REITs (2 stocks)

Aerospace & Defense (2 stocks)

Although cryptocurrency is still in nascent stages 91% of crypto holders believe it’ll become as common as card payments. Despite making major strides existing electronic payment systems suffer in regards to cost efficiency and access.

Legacy systems still fall short of providing access to financial services to 1.7bn adults or efficient cross-border retail payments. Blockchain technology brings the benefits of faster settlement access to new customers and lower barriers to entry.

Blockchain networks handle international transactions in minutes as opposed to the traditional days or hours. They can settle transactions for under $0.01 considerably cheaper than traditional payment card networks. The rise of stablecoins has highlighted shortcomings in traditional cross-border payments. Studies show that distributed ledger technology improves the efficiency of cross-border payments and blockchain technology could help banks save $27bn by 2030 on international transactions.

Cross-border payments matter. They account for 15%-20% of ecommerce value . Small- and medium-sized enterprises making up 90% of businesses and 50% of jobs globally need easier access to international payments. Remittances are a $589bn market and a major source of capital for developing countries. They are also a lifeline for 281m migrants. Cryptocurrency is making a dent in this market dominated by international operators with Africa seeing $562m worth of cryptocurrency inflows. Although various forms of cryptocurrencies are used for payments stablecoins and central bank digital currencies have won favour for their stability. Stablecoins are primarily used for trading lending or borrowing digital assets but could become used widely as a means of payment if well designed interoperable and buttressed by regulatory guardrails.

Payments giants are taking notice: Visa’s network allows people to settle transactions in USD Coin a dollar stablecoin and Moneygram partnered with Stellar to offer stablecoin for fiat remittances in India. International remittances cost an average of 6.4% for $200. A transaction could involve up to four intermediaries. Fluctuating exchange rates exacerbate inefficiencies. And the burden is disproportionately borne by underprivileged segments with fees for cross-border retail payments reaching 10%.

The Financial Stability Board wants to get remittance fees to the UN sustainable development goal of 3% and 1% for retail fees by 2027. International stablecoin transactions cost less than 0.1%. Sending crypto to another user on the Binance Smart Chain costs between $0.01-$0.10.

Cross-border retail payments can take days to clear due to the number of intermediaries. Crypto transactions clear within seconds; a great way to meet the FSB’s target of clearing 75% of transactions within one hour.

All financial institutions must have a cross-border payments option for retail wholesale and remittances. Cryptocurrencies can address access challenges such as multilateral settlement eligibility and the lack of correspondent bank relationships.

Users must be provided with information about how much a transaction will cost how long it will take its status as well as terms of service – all automatically visible in a blockchain’s public ledger.

These improvements are consistent with the G20 Roadmap for enhancing cross-border payments and its four challenges and targets covering cost speed access and transparency to be met by 2027.

CBDCs offer ‘the unique advantages of central bank money: settlement finality liquidity and integrity’ with emerging markets leading on adoption. Interoperable CBDCs are key for cross-border payments. Interlinking CBDC systems through a hub and spoke or single system might bring more improvement to the market than compatibility or single access points. International co-operation in early stages is necessary to address underserved cross-border corridors. Crypto for payments regulation should follow a risk-based approach specific to the tool’s structural features usage and risks.

With risk management and regulatory guardrails stablecoins and CBDCs could become the go-to payments solution for cutting edge technology such as in the metaverse. Stablecoins have been critical to decentralised finance’s. The future of payments backed by new digital currencies is looking bright.

Grocery prices have shocked many but it took a trip away for Lenka Logue to really open her eyes.

“I was outside Canada for two weeks. When I was back I was in shock” Logue told Global News.

A recipient of the provincial Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped (AISH) program the jump in grocery bills were hard to swallow for her.

“Everything is going up and we don’t know how we will live now. It’s terrible” Logue said.

Support is supposed to be on the way but Albertans looking to get financial relief promised by the province for the new year will have to wait before they can apply.

Among the $2.8 billion in measures announced in late November 2022 were “affordability payments” $100 per month for six months going to seniors families with children under 18 and Albertans on support programs like AISH income support and the Persons with Developmental Disabilities (PDD) program.

Household incomes for the families and seniors have to be under $180000 to qualify for the $600 total per child or senior.

University of Calgary economics professor Trevor Tombe said the payments are closely aligned to the impacts families are feeling during these inflationary times.

“If you’re a family with about two kids and you’re earning no more than around $120000 per year then I estimate these cash transfers will basically fully offset the expenditure pressures that your family is facing from higher prices due to inflation” he told Global News.

Tombe said the increased costs of food and fuel — items that are seeing the greatest inflationary pressures — are what’s really driving up budgets for families with children. He added seniors aren’t typically seeing spending increases greater than individuals without children.

And while people already registered with AISH PDD income support and the Alberta Seniors Benefit will get the extra c-note automatically others who are eligible will have to wait until the application process opens.

“Details on how to apply for the affordability payments will be announced in the new year” the province’s affordability website says. When they will be paid out is also yet to be announced.

But it looks like the province is building its own application portal similar to Alberta’s assistance programs rolled out early in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Shannon Phillips MLA for Lethbridge-West and chair of the provincial committee on public accounts urged the finance minister to use an already-existing federal infrastructure to help get the affordability payments out in a faster more secure and more accountable way.

“I strongly encourage you to use established systems through the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to ensure timely and accurate payments to Albertans. Doing this would allow Albertans to forgo applying for the $100 payments” Phillips wrote to Travis Toews on Dec. 21.

“Given what we learned at the committee developing a new system within the Government of Alberta to deliver these new affordability payments represents an unacceptable risk of delays on the payments promised to Albertans facing an affordability crisis not seen in 40 years.

“Building a brand-new (Government of Alberta) system to deliver payments in January is a risky proposition when there is a custom-built vehicle in CRA to deliver payments promptly accurately and at virtually no cost.” Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: ""Building a brand-new (Government of Alberta) system to deliver payments in January is a risky proposition when there is a custom-built vehicle in CRA to deliver payments promptly accurately and at virtually no cost.""

In her letter to Toews Phillips outlined the auditor general’s findings of “serious problems” in the delivery and verification of emergency supports like the Small and Medium Enterprise Relaunch Grants (SMERG) and the Emergency Isolation Support Program.

The $650-million SMERG program was an honour-based program designed to be verified in the future. Just more than one per cent of the 101762 recipients were assessed and 52 per cent of those were paid in error.

The similarly-designed Emergency Isolation Support Program tried to only verify 150 people receiving 41 responses with largely-incomplete information.

On Monday Alberta NDP deputy leader Sarah Hoffman issued a statement demanding information on when the affordability payments will go to eligible individuals and families.

“The Premier made a commitment to help Alberta families on Nov. 22 — that was more than 40 days ago” Hoffman said. “It is unacceptable that there are still more questions than answers when it comes to these critical inflation payments.

“It’s been crickets from the UCP over the Christmas holidays” Hoffman continued. “The price of gas is skyrocketing utility rates are expected to hit record highs and Albertans are bracing for January credit card bills. They deserve answers.”

In a statement to Global News Andrea Farmer the press secretary for Minister of Affordability and Utilities Matt Jones said the payments “will help offset inflationary pressures.”

“The first monthly affordability payments will start later this month and we look forward to announcing more details very soon” she said.

Farmer said the province will continue exploring other ideas to “keep Alberta affordable.” Ideas like the electricity rebates fuel tax relief reindexing income taxes and AISH to inflation and the yet-to-be-triggered natural gas price protection.

The U of C economics professor said despite a rise in inflation not seen since the 1950s he doesn’t expect to see additional affordability measures from governments if inflation starts to ease this year.

“With the potential exception of Alberta because we have a budget coming in February a pretty competitive election just a couple of months after that and large resource revenues giving a province a lot of room to maneuver.”

Logue said she doubts the promised $100 per month will help her and her family much.

“Everybody’s struggling” Logue said."

He’s making his secret 34-ingredient marinade that goes with everything—including the crispy chicken sandwich that put him on the map in post-pandemic Naples. Around 5 or 6 a.m. you’ll find him sneaking in a workout at Naples’ Athletica Health & Fitness after dropping off an order of grab-and-go healthy meals for the gym’s clients. By 10 a.m. he may be strolling the fields at Immokalee State Farmer’s Market or meeting with fishers from Dilly’s Fish Co. to source day-boat ingredients for his menus. “Nothing closer to our backyards” he notes. Later he might build a personalized meal plan for clients including MLB outfielder Max Kepler and former NFL wide receiver Michael Walker.

And though it’s only been four years since the multihyphenate earned his associate’s degree from Keiser University one could say it’s been a lifelong trajectory to a career in the culinary arts. A first-generation Haitian-American who grew up helping in his parents’ restaurants Ricardo put himself through culinary school in Tallahassee working three jobs and sleeping on a friend’s couch for a year. “It was a real humbling experience” he says. “In my culture we’re not supposed to ask for help. You just do whatever you need to do to get there.”

Before Ricardo launched his meal-prep and to-go company Chef Global’s Kitchen and two eponymous food trucks he developed a love for international flavors as a cook for The Walt Disney Company and later on a cruise line. “I remember sitting outside and there were people at the table from South Africa Zimbabwe India Norway Japan” he says. “It was so much to take in. And it helped set the stage for learning more about other cultures.” The budding chef was inspired to travel the world learning to cook heritage foods from local chefs. He traveled to 17 countries—to Italy to make pasta to Mexico to master tortillas—in less than two years.

In September he bought a catering business Creative Catering Naples inheriting a full kitchen for private parties and events. Still he’s poured his focus into meal preps that allow the fitness-centric chef to tailor each menu based on the client’s goals and lifestyle. “I’m really giddy about this one” Ricardo says. “I’m going to give you what you want while meeting your goals. Are you trying to lose 30-40 pounds but you don’t like broccoli? Then I won’t give you broccoli; I’ll find other ways to help you lose weight.” He strives to source locally including produce from Immokalee farms and prime cuts from Jimmy P’s Butcher Shop & Deli. And his global influence is sure to shine through with healthy takes on comfort dishes like his food truck’s famous teriyaki chicken bowl with baked protein and cauliflower rice for a lower carb count.

Despite the long hours and dizzying schedule the 24-year-old Ricardo is an enthusiastic man whose lust for life is rarely eclipsed. He exudes joy when talking about cooking for others and has only gratitude in his voice when he mentions his alarm going off at 4 a.m. every day. “It’s easier to keep going than to stop” he says. “I would do this for free if I could; this is the most fun I’ve had in my entire life.”

Several “long stretches” in jail and the unrelenting grip of addiction consumed her next two decades separating Amado from her three children and making traditional employment impossible.

Brows furrowed Daynna Amado stared at her phone and contemplated making the call that would register her for her first semester of school in nearly 30 years. Finally swiveling nervously in an office chair at Recovery on the Harbor’s drop-in center in East Boston she made the call; within seconds a voice picked up on the other end.

Now more than seven months clean Amado is one of more than 40 participants in Services Over Sentences or SOS a recovery program for people trying to overcome substance use disorder. The expanded program relaunched by the Suffolk district attorney’s office in June in partnership with the mental health organization North Suffolk Community Services targets individuals trapped in the cycle of addiction on Mass. and Cass the neighborhood surrounding Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard that is widely considered the center of Boston’s homelessness and substance use epidemic.

Mass. and Cass has long been a thorn in the side of city and state officials. While Boston’s mayor Michelle Wu has committed to a public health response rooted in the clearing of encampments and a proliferation of harm reduction tools several community organizers have criticized Wu and other elected leaders for not acting aggressively enough to curb open-air drug usage and provide recovery services to those in need.

“We can’t continue allowing people to overdose day in and day out just because we have Narcan” said Domingos DaRosa a Roxbury youth advocate who said he recently helped administer Narcan to a man who had overdosed multiple times that week. “There’s nothing people can do to put him in treatment unless he wants to do it voluntarily... so we need to have law and order.”

Steve Fox a community leader with the neighborhood association South End Forum added that those working to help people who struggle with substance use at Mass. and Cass “agree that we need a public health approach” but any strategy should include spreading out services across the city.

“We also need a concentrated law enforcement focus so that drug dealing is not continuing on a day-to-day basis right under the eyes of outreach workers neighbors businesses and those who are trying to keep their sobriety” Fox said.

In an effort to strike a balance between various approaches SOS involves law enforcement as a way to incentivize people already in the justice system whose problems are rooted in substance use disorder to seek help and get clean.

Rather than a diversion program or a specialty drug court both of which often pause or redirect cases out of the justice system entirely SOS operates while a person’s case is making its way through the courts. If participants agree to a treatment plan drafted by substance use clinicians and are able to stick with it the district attorney’s office will work to lower their sentence reduce probation or dismiss their case altogether.

Amado for example was arrested last summer on a stolen vehicle charge after taking a car to sleep in she said. But after learning about the program through her inpatient recovery center four months ago and deciding to give it a try that charge — and a handful of old warrants — could be dismissed giving Amado a fresh start.

“Jail doesn’t help anyone. It just puts us away and that’s it. But here I have treatment” she said. “They’re saving my life right now.”

Challenges and road bumps are expected but if at any point a participant decides to leave the program their case proceeds as usual. Marc Tohme deputy chief of district and municipal courts at the Suffolk District Attorney’s Office said he believes it’s “important to ensure that justice isn’t delayed by our willingness to provide these services.”

“There is no downside to trying SOS and failing” Tohme said because “the case isn’t delayed if someone has fallen out of the program. We can continue the case and keep moving.”

Designed to last anywhere from three to 18 months depending on the individual the program is open to anyone whose criminal behavior is fueled by their addiction and is not limited solely to drug charges. Violent crimes sex crimes and human trafficking are among the offenses that don’t qualify Tohme explained “but we don’t like to close any doors.”

The court instead leaves “exceptions open via a stringent review process” he added.

Program coordinator Caitlin Gillespie said larceny fraudulent checks and breaking and entering are among the most common charges and typically involve the individual trying to find ways to support their habit. The program has received 69 referrals since June Gillespie said a number that is quickly climbing as word of SOS spreads. Since the program is entirely voluntary participants must opt in and choose to stick with it; of the total referrals Gillespie said there are 42 active participants who comprise a diverse mix of age race and gender.

In addition to helping participants get clean Gillespie said recovery coaches identify goals that participants can pursue even after the program ends like finding a job or earning a degree. The hope she said is that by rebuilding their routine far away from the substances that once ensnared them graduates won’t feel as tempted to slip back into old patterns. And as they take those big steps toward a new life their coaches are with them every step of the way.

“I don’t care what time it is in the morning if it’s 1- 2- 3- 4 o’clock if I am craving she’ll walk me through my feelings and help me figure out what to do” said Amado who joked that her close relationship with her recovery coach has made her the “poster child” of the program.

Another strength of SOS is its ability to clear participants’ old warrants so they can look for work with a clean record said Sue Sullivan executive director of the Newmarket Business Improvement District which employs several program participants and works to find jobs for people in recovery in the neighborhood surrounding Mass. and Cass.

Sullivan said she has seen the program’s impact firsthand watching men and women who once felt trapped by their substance use find steady employment and stable housing.

“SOS gives them an option to clear up these things so they can change the trajectory of their lives” she said.

Amado has already cleared multiple warrants but said the most valuable change has been the opportunity to reconnect with her three sons. She has a newfound sense of self-worth that she says for the first time in 20 years has allowed her to believe she can be a faithful mother.

“I never thought about whether I wanted be a parent or not but now... I want to get out [of] the system and I want to support my family and I want to be a mom” Amado said. “I never really worked a day in my life I never had normal friends and so when people say they want their lives back I don’t know what that means.”

“But this life clean and sober this is the life that I want” she continued. “I haven’t found anything bigger or better than this.”

After all it had happened before.

Measures were in place around the world to spot early signs of a never-before-seen bug with dangerous potential.

That's why on Dec. 31 2019 China notified the World Health Organization that a novel pathogen was circulating in Wuhan the most populous city in central China. A day later in that city of 12 million a wet market selling live animals was shuttered because of fears it was the source of the virus that would later be named SARS-CoV-2.

Three years later the risk of a deadly pathogen spreading around the world remains.

Now in addition to worrying about a virus that might jump from animals to humans experts are concerned about research accidents and – what should be unthinkable – the possibility of someone intentionally unleashing a highly contagious and lethal pathogen.

A pandemic has long been known to be far riskier for global security than conventional nuclear or chemical warfare said Lawrence Gostin a professor of public health law at Georgetown University and a leading expert in global health.

""We've seen that play out with COVID and COVID is far from the worst pandemic threat that we face"" he said.

Although COVID-19 has killed more than 6.6 million people worldwide other pandemics have been more lethal. The 1918 flu is estimated to have cost 50 million lives across the globe and in the 14th century the Black Death killed 30% to 60% of all Europeans in just four years.

Public health and national defense experts worry the next pandemic will come at an even higher price than this one. And they say the nation needs to be ready.

""It's incumbent on the United States and other countries to be prepared for whatever comes from biology whether it's from nature or from engineering or a laboratory accident"" said Dr. Tom Inglesby director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security at the Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Opinion:3 years after COVID-19 lockdowns have we really emerged from those dark days safely?

The next pandemic could be worse

Gostin sees nature as the most likely source of the next pandemic. A highly lethal strain of bird or swine flu could mutate naturally to become contagious to humans. That scenario kept health experts like Gostin awake at night long before COVID-19.

But other causes are possible.

""We have a whole host of threats from lab leaks to bioterror to bioweapons to naturally occurring zoonotic spillovers"" said Gostin author of the 2021 book ""Global Health Security: A Blueprint for the Future.""

""All of that leads to quite a high probability that we're going to have more frequent pandemic-like threats and we need to take them seriously as a national security threat.""

The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the third coronavirus to pose a major health threat following the first SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome – both of which are far more lethal. Another coronavirus with the contagious potential of SARS-CoV-2 and the 30% death rate of MERS would threaten the economy supply chains and the health care system not to mention human life.

And those are just the direct consequences.

With COVID-19 we're likely to see indirect effects for years as people who skipped routine medical care are diagnosed with more advanced and deadlier cancers and children who missed routine vaccines fall ill with preventable diseases among other consequences Gostin said.

""If you think of a far worse pandemic you can multiply that by ten- or even fiftyfold in terms of the economic and social harms the United States would suffer"" he said.

That means the world needs to have a better capacity to fight such threats not spending money only after the crisis arrives he and others said.

Right now only about 5% of the country's health care dollars are spent on public health and preventing the next crisis. ""That's a rounding error in the U.S. budget"" Gostin said.

Human-made threats are real

The idea of engineering a deadly pathogen that sickens the world sounds like the stuff of science fiction or superhero movies. But it's no longer a fantasy.

Kevin Esvelt an MIT biologist said people in his own lab could theoretically assemble a dangerous virus from DNA ordered on the internet for under $1000.

Once pandemic-capable viruses are identified thousands of people worldwide have the scientific training to make them from mail-ordered synthetic DNA.

""Imagine a world where you can order weapons-grade plutonium in the mail"" he said ""and there are thousands of engineers who have the skills to put together something that might be a bomb.""

In less than 100 days last fall and winter the omicron coronavirus variant spread from southern Africa to the rest of the world infecting 26% of Americans Esvelt said illustrating how fast a pandemic response needs to be.

Esvelt warned Congress earlier this year that pandemic virus identification would make pandemics widely accessible and recently released a 30-page plan preparing for a world in which it's feasible to unleash one.

The risk is real and growing over time as engineering biology becomes easier said Jaime Yassif vice president of the Nuclear Threat Initiative's Global Biological Policy and Programs. Still it's not ""trivial to create a biological weapon that would cause significant harm"" she said.

COVID-19 made the threat more real she and others said by showing how much chaos a global pandemic can sow.

""Some people may have taken note of the impact and paid more attention than before"" Yassif said. ""It's reasonable to assume that the intentions are already there and they may be growing and that capabilities are increasingly within reach. That's my rational calculus about why I take it seriously.""

The potential for bioterrorism

The global Biological Weapons Convention was enacted in March 1975 to prevent countries from ever developing or producing biological weapons. It has largely held ever since though a few countries that signed on to the treaty are believed to have or have had secret programs.

The Soviets once tried to engineer Ebola into a more contagious pathogen for instance but it didn't work well said Christine Parthemore CEO of the Council on Strategic Risks a nonprofit nonpartisan security policy institute.

China and Iran may have come right up to the line if not crossed it making offensive weapons she said. Based on U.S. government public assessments for example Iran may be using ""botulinum toxin that we don't think is for Botox at least not solely.""

""The history is there"" Parthemore said. ""Countries have engineered pathogens.""

The Defense Department initially became interested in mRNA vaccines which were used to fight COVID-19 as a rapid way to counter state-based biological threats and engineered pathogens she said.

And the vaccine that proved effective this summer against mpox (formerly known as monkeypox) was developed to counter the possibility that someone might try to unleash its deadlier cousin smallpox on the world.

But the vast majority of countries are unlikely to try to unleash a deadly pathogen she said because it would be hard to protect their own people during a massive outbreak.

Still Parthemore worries nations are losing faith in international institutions and treaties. Russia's war against Ukraine and the United Nations' inability to stop it have weakened international agreements in the eyes of many nations including those focused on biosecurity.

""The loss of faith in cooperation and the U.N. and collective action and Russia and others acting as they have further degrading the norms we've held onto so dearly for decades – it's pretty scary"" she said.

Should research be regulated?

One question is how much regulation should be imposed on scientific work and researchers involved in synthesizing potential pathogens.

Yassif supports ""more rules of the road"" to safeguard the scientific advances that might be misused by bad actors.

In 2012 the scientific community and others debated research in the U.S. and the Netherlands that explored five mutations making avian influenza more contagious to humans. Some in the virology community defended that research as essential for understanding naturally emerging risks. Yassif and others worry it made creating a global hazard one step easier.

""The systems we have in place are not as broad in scope or as robust as they need to be"" Yassif said.

The construction of new biosafety labs also has raised concerns among experts.

Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic more than a dozen countries have announced plans to build Level 4 labs the highest level of security designed to investigate the most dangerous pathogens.

These labs lack strong international oversight Parthemore said. ""Obviously if you had an offensive program and you were trying to engineer pathogens in certain ways a BSL-4 laboratory is where you would do the work"" she said. ""The lack of transparency in these labs and their proliferation is a huge problem.""

It's also too easy to order the building blocks of a pathogen on the internet Yassif said. Some companies screen orders to make sure they're not selling dangerous DNA sequences to bad actors but they're not required to do so. ""There's probably a sizeable market share that's not being screened and we're trying to close that gap"" she said.

How to prepare for the next one

No single action can reduce the pandemic risk to zero the experts said.

But there are plenty of options for actions and a ""layered defense."" Intervening at multiple points in the process a bad actor would use to create a biological weapon will make the world much safer.

Technology can solve the problem created by biology Esvelt said. He envisions better protective gear especially for health care and other essential workers as well as germicidal lights that kill pathogens without harming the people who use the same indoor space. He wants wastewater and air surveillance at airports to detect new pathogens that might have a long incubation period before showing symptoms as HIV does.

Preparedness isn't just about scientific breakthroughs. It also involves investing in people said Dr. Raj Panjabi senior director for global health security and biodefense for the U.S. National Security Council.

For decades the U.S. has underinvested in those who deliver public and animal health he said including epidemiologists veterinarians public health nurses and community health workers.

In October the Biden administration launched what it called a National Biodefense Strategy and Implementation Plan for Countering Biological Threats Enhancing Pandemic Preparedness and Achieving Global Health Security.

Panjabi described some of the strategy's goals and timelines in a webinar this fall:

Testing: Enable testing for a new pathogen within 12 hours surge testing within a week and pathogen-specific testing within 30 days

Enable testing for a new pathogen within 12 hours surge testing within a week and pathogen-specific testing within 30 days Vaccination: A new vaccine should be developed within 100 days enough manufactured for the entire U.S. population within 130 days and for high-risk populations around the world within 200 days.

A new vaccine should be developed within 100 days enough manufactured for the entire U.S. population within 130 days and for high-risk populations around the world within 200 days. Treatment: Drugs should be repurposed within 90 days and new therapeutics developed within 180 days.

""Time is lives in an emergency"" he said. ""How well we respond depends on how well we prepare.""

The administration has asked for $88 billion over the next five years to implement the plan. ""Billions to be invested now to save trillions in the future and an incalculable amount of human lives both American and around the world"" Panjabi said.

Congress has not yet followed up with enough funding to pursue this agenda.

""It makes no sense that Congress has not taken up the administration’s proposed pandemic preparedness agenda"" said Inglesby who recently co-wrote a proposal for the development of diagnostics in a health emergency. He hopes the money will be allocated soon.

Another disastrous pandemic is not inevitable he and others said but prevention requires preparation and forethought.

""Pathogens of various forms are very good at adapting and changing form. But modern science is very good at countering that"" Gostin said. ""If we're smart and well prepared and invest strongly and robustly in it we can substantially lower the risk.""

The CEO of the investment bank wrote in his letter “We are conducting a careful review and while discussions are still ongoing we anticipate our headcount reduction will take place in the first half of January.”

In the letter which has been accessed by Business Today Solomon highlighted that tightening monetary conditions and the slowdown in economic activity are the reasons behind the layoff round.

“There are a variety of factors impacting the business landscape including tightening monetary conditions that are slowing down economic activity. For our leadership team the focus is on preparing the firm to weather these headwinds"" he wrote.

It is worth noting that the investment bank is going through a rough patch when it comes to its finances. As per the company’s Q3 FY22 report their banking net sales are down 57 per cent year-on-year. Moreover in Q3 FY22 the net revenues from corporate lending are down 77 per cent while equity underwriting is down 79 per cent as compared to Q3 FY21.

Interestingly as revenues and profits are going down in the past years the company’s headcount has gone significantly up. As per data from the company website the employee headcount is over 49000 up 34 per cent from 2018.

The CEO noted in his letter “We need to proceed with caution and manage our resources wisely.”

Goldman Sachs is not the only financial services company that is facing headwinds due to the ongoing economic slowdown. Morgan Stanley laid off 1600 people last month to cut down costs. Financial services giants like Deutsche Bank Credit Suisse Group Barclays and others have also slowed down hiring in a bid to brace for the impending slowdown.

Business Today has reached out to Goldman Sachs for an official statement. The story will be updated as and when they respond.

Congressman-Elect George Santos says he is “the full embodiment of the American Dream.” Based on his career he thinks he would be a great addition to the U.S. House committee that monitors the financial services industry.

Rep. Santos’ campaign biography defines him as the son of Brazilian immigrants who graduated from Baruch College of the City University of New York. He then took jobs at Citigroup and later Goldman Sachs.

The New York Times (2022) reports that none of the three institutions confirm the claims. When confronted he claimed he was “embellishing” his resume—and that people do that all the time.

Mr. Santos’ mother was a nurse who lived in a Brazilian city. Court records in that country state that Mr. Santos stole the checkbook of a man his mother was caring for. He used the checkbook to make fraudulent purchases including a pair of shoes. Mr. Santos confessed to the crime but did not mention it in his biography.

What is a Psychopath?

According to Jack McCullough (2021) longtime CFO founder of the CFO Leadership Council and author of The Psychopathic CEO psychopaths should not be confused with psychotics. The latter have distorted sense of reality. The psychopath does not. A sociopath might be described as hot-headed and impulsive. The psychopath is manipulative calculating and cold-hearted. It is a personality disorder.

McCullough estimates that 1% of males and between .3 and .7% of females meet the definition of psychopath. The corporate world is an attractive arena for psychopaths. They have many of the traits that board members admire when selecting CEOs: unemotional charismatic confident innovative creative and persuasive.

Industries requiring innovation entertainment and creativity are prime targets for CEO psychopaths. Companies whose strategies revolve around exit via Initial Public Offering or being acquired are also attractive. Having worked for many companies McCullough estimates that 12-16% of U.S. CEOs are psychopaths.

Assume you are a C-Suite professional in an industry in which it is normal to change jobs every 3-4 years. That translates into a career working for at least 12-20 different CEOs. Assuming you have worked for 12 CEOs in your career and the CEO psychopathy rate is 12% there is a 78% chance that you will report to one psychopath in your career.

Managing Your Psychopathic Boss

McCullough recommends that if the boss yells at you sit there and take it: “You just listen you don’t react let him get it all out. It is your reaction that keeps a psychopath fueled. Know that it’s not personal.

""Don’t tie your identity into that job. Assume that every day is a learning opportunity. When you are eventually fired take what you learned and do something else with it.""

While reporting to a psychopath document everything with an assumption that lawyers will one day be reviewing your records. Keep a set of documents on your computer at home. You may need these files if things get hostile. Assume that your boss will eliminate access to your business computer files.

How to Avoiding Hiring Psychopaths

Assuming the psychopathology rate for CEOs is 12% and the board is evaluating four candidates what is the probability that your candidate is a psychopath? Boards should insist that the basics of checking references and verifying credentials be followed; the psychopathic candidate assumes other people are lazy or incompetent.

Here is an example from our experience:

Our client was the seventh largest U.S. company in its industry. We were retained to present at least four qualified CEO candidates to the board's Selection Committee. Of the four we presented one was clearly the most charismatic and charming. His resume was perfect.

We went into reference-checking mode. The CEO claimed to have received an undergraduate degree from a specific college. When we asked the college to confirm date of degree the college had no record.

When confronted with the discrepancy the CEO candidate got angry with us. He stated that his father had suddenly died. He was forced to drop out of college and assist his mother in taking care of siblings. How dare we hold this tragedy against him!

We replied that had he been honest on his resume the board would have been sympathetic. But he lied.

In preparation for this blog post we went on LinkedIn to see if the candidate had learned his lesson. His profile continued to erroneously state that he received his undergraduate degree.

He also claimed to have brought a company to a successful exit. Upon closer examination that company’s exit was bankruptcy.

Summary and Conclusions:

In your career you may find yourself reporting to a psychopath or interviewing a psychopath as a candidate for employment. It is possible to avert hiring such people and managing your reaction if you are unfortunate enough to report to one.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVmaW5hbmNpYWxjYXJlZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDEvYmlnLXRyZW5kcy1yZXNoYXBlLXlvdXItcmVjcnVpdG1lbnQtaW4tMjAyM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The big trends that will reshape your recruitment in 2023,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVmaW5hbmNpYWxjYXJlZXJzLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvMDEvYmlnLXRyZW5kcy1yZXNoYXBlLXlvdXItcmVjcnVpdG1lbnQtaW4tMjAyM9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E38612A0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Said to include both screen-accurate lights and sounds the costume prop was initially given a June 21st 2022 release date with hopes of getting the unlicensed nuclear accelerators onto fans’ backs well in time for the Halloween season only to then be delayed multiple times.

With the New Year now here and today January 1st 2023 serving as the most recent release date the product page was just updated but instead of either being available or given a new ETA the Proton Pack is now listed simply as “Out of Stock” despite HalloweenCostumes.com never taking pre-orders nor any inventory ever becoming available.





In a previous update we reported that a then-recent delay was said to likely pertain to safety protocols ensuring standards were adhered to and that further testing was still needed. This time while information is a bit more scarce we’ve been informed that internally these are still to be manufactured being hopeful of availability between Q1-Q2 of 2023.

While not the most technical the listing page does provide a few bits of detail about the construction of the pack reading:

“Our team of designers studied the props used in the movie to capture a realistic feel when crafting this Ghostbusters Proton Pack Costume Replica. The pack is made out of sturdy molded plastic. Small touches like attached wiring black tubing a circular section on the bottom that’s designed to look like a cyclotron portion. The pack also makes real sounds from the movie so you can relive classic scenes. The neutrona wand can even be holstered on the side of the pack when you’re not fighting against Gozer the Gozerian. The adjustable shoulder straps have padding in them which helps make for a comfortable fit whether you’re wearing it to hunt ghosts or you just want to stay comfortable all night.”

An additional delay is certainly not welcome news for HalloweenCostumes.com especially given that Hasbro recently confirmed that their crowdfunded HasLab Ghostbusters Plasma Series Spengler’s Proton Packs would begin shipping to North American backers this month much earlier than the pre-advertised Spring 2023 estimate. There’s undoubtedly a market for those who were unable to back Hasbro’s replica with Halloween Costumes‘ eventual release believed to be full-sized.

As always we’ll continue to follow this story reporting on any further updates including the eventual release giving it a full feature and unboxing through the Ghostbusters News YouTube channel.

This year looks like it will be yet another year of financial underperformance with rural providers in especially dire circumstances.

What’s driving this bleak financial reality? It’s “primarily an expense story” said Erik Swanson a senior vice president at Kaufman Hall‘s data analytics practice.

“Growth in expenses has vastly outpaced growth in revenues — since pre-pandemic levels since last year and even the year prior — such that margins are ultimately being pushed downward. And hospitals’ median operating margin is still below zero on a cumulative basis” he declared referring to 2021 and 2020.

Here’s some context about how dismal this situation is: Even in 2020 a year in which hospitals saw extraordinary losses during the first few months of the pandemic they still reported operating margins of 2%.

What’s even more disconcerting is that hospitals are underperforming financially pretty much across the board Swanson said.

For example the financial reports for the country’s three largest nonprofit health systems — Ascension CommonSpirit Health and Trinity Health — revealed they are all struggling. Ascension reported a $118.6 million loss in the third quarter of 2022 CommonSpirit posted a $227 million loss and Trinity posted a $550.9 million loss.

Sponsored Post A Personalized Approach to Medication Nonadherence At the Abarca Forward conference earlier this year George Van Antwerp managing director at Deloitte discussed how social determinants of health and a personalized member experience can improve medication adherence and health outcomes.

Even Kaiser Permanente one of the country’s largest health systems with an integrated delivery model reported a $1.5 billion loss for the third quarter of 2022.

Rural hospitals are in even worse shape but more on that below.

Other hospitals have been forced to shutter service lines to offset these financial losses. Some are also turning to integration and consolidation.

For example Hermann Area District Hospital in Missouri said last month that it is seeking a “deeper affiliation” with Mercy Health or another provider. This announcement came after the hospital eliminated its home health agency as a cost-cutting measure. In December the hospital projected a loss of $2 million for 2022.

We can also look at the mega-merger between Atrium Health and Advocate Aurora Health which was completed last month. The deal which is designed for cost synergy creates the fifth-largest nonprofit integrated health system in the U.S.

The merger was finalized one day after North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein expressed concern about how the deal could impact rural communities. He said that while he didn’t have a legal basis within his office’s limited statutory authority to block the deal he was worried that it could further restrict access to healthcare in rural and underserved communities.

Stein brings up an extremely valid concern. Rural hospitals’ dismal financial circumstances are becoming more and more worrisome — in fact about 30% of all rural hospitals are at risk of closing in the near future according to a recent report from the Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform (CHQPR).

A crucial reason for this is that it is more expensive to deliver healthcare in rural areas — usually because of smaller patient volumes and higher costs for attracting staff. Another factor is that payments rural hospitals receive from commercial health plans isn’t enough to cover the cost of delivering care to patients in rural areas said Harold Miller CEO of CHQPR.

“Many people assume that private commercial insurance plans pay more than Medicare and Medicaid. But for small rural hospitals the exact opposite is true” he said. “In many cases Medicare is their best payer. And private health plans actually pay them well below their costs — well below what they pay their larger hospitals. One of the biggest drivers of rural hospital losses is the payments they receive from private health plans.”

In Miller’s view rural hospitals perform two main functions: taking care of sick people in the hospital and being there for people in case they need to go to the hospital.

To fulfill the latter job rural hospitals must operate 24/7 emergency rooms. These hospitals get paid when there’s an emergency but not when there isn’t — even though the hospital is incurring costs by operating and staffing these units.

“Rural hospitals have a physician on duty 24/7 to be available for emergencies. But they don’t get paid for that by most payers. Medicare does pay them for that but other payers don’t. If the hospital is doing two different things we should be paying them for both of those things. Hospitals should be paid for what I refer to as ‘standby capacity’” Miller said.

He bolstered his argument by pointing to these analogies: Do we only pay firefighters when there’s a fire? Do we only pay police officers when there’s a crime?

It’s also important to remember that rural hospitals are in the midst of transitioning to a post-pandemic environment now without the pandemic-era financial assistance they received from the government said Brock Slabach chief operations officer at the National Rural Health Association.

“Rural providers are looking to move into the future without the benefit of those extra payments. And they’re in an environment of really high inflation. It’s over 8% and for some goods and services in the healthcare sector that’s going to be over 20% in terms of increased prices. Wages and salaries have also gone up significantly. But patient volumes have maintained below average or average. That all presents a huge challenge” Slabach said.

Rural providers across the country are dealing with the stressors Slabach described and clamoring for more government help. For example the Michigan Health & Hospital Association sought more money from the state last month after having to take 1700 beds offline.

Many rural hospitals can’t escape their fate. From 2010 to 2021 there were 136 rural hospital closures. There were only two closures in 2021 and Slabach said 2022 produced a similarly low number. But these low totals are due to government relief he explained. Slabach said he’s expecting an increase in rural hospital closures in 2023.

When a rural hospital closes it means community members have to travel far distances for emergency or inpatient care. Miller pointed out another problem: in many rural communities the hospital is the only place people can go to get laboratory or imaging work done. The hospital might also be the only source of primary care for the community. Shuttering these hospitals would be a massive blow to rural Americans’ healthcare access.

In the face of these potentially devastating blows to patient access financial analysts’ outlook is bleak.

Higher inflation and costly labor expenses will continue to have negative effects on hospitals — both rural and urban — in 2023 according to an analysis from Moody’s. Expenses will also continue to increase due to supply chain bottlenecks the need for more robust cybersecurity investments and longer hospital stays due to higher levels of patient acuity.

All of this doom and gloom begs the question — are any hospitals doing well financially?

The answer is yes a select few. Let’s look at the three largest for-profit health systems in the nation — Community Health Systems HCA Healthcare and Tenet Healthcare. As of 2020 these three public health systems accounted for about 8% of hospital beds in the U.S.

These three systems all had positive operating margins for the majority of the pandemic including most recently in the third quarter of 2022.

Large public health systems have shareholders to report to and stock prices to worry about. Does this mean they’re more likely to deny care to patients who can’t afford it while other hospitals pick up the slack?

Slabach said it’s tough to say.

“Obviously hospitals try to mitigate their exposure to risk when it comes to taking care of patients. Most hospitals do a really good job of providing services and care to people who don’t have insurance or don’t have the means to pay. But that gets stressed in this current financial environment. So indeed there may be instances where what you suggested might happen but it’s not because they want to deny services or deny care. It’s because they have a bigger picture they have to maintain” Slabach said.

And the big picture involving dollar signs for hospitals looks pretty bleak in 2023.

After McCorvey's water broke at a family celebration on New Year's Eve the couple left Thomasville Ga. for Tallahassee Memorial Healthcare (TMH). They delivered the capital city's first baby of 2023 just hours later.

Robert Dean Perry III was born at 6:04 a.m. New Year's day weighing in at 5 pounds 9 ounces and 18.4 inches long. About four and a half hours later HCA Florida Capital Hospital welcomed its first baby of the new year Kace Lawson Sellers. The baby boy weighed in at 7 pounds 7 ounces and 19.25 inches long.

McCorvey and Perry Jr. said spending the evening giving birth to their son was the first-time parents' craziest New Year yet but they joked that it will at least be an easy birthday to remember.

""It's the latest I've ever stayed up on a New Year's"" Perry Jr. said.

Their son scooping the title for Tallahassee's first 2023 baby was a surprise. The newborn who will go by Tripp was born a few weeks early.

""To know that he was the first not only in this hospital but in such a big city we definitely didn't expect that"" McCorvey said.

The new mother said she was glad to spend the first holiday of many with her son and that she is most excited for more firsts with him.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vc291dGhmbG9yaWRhaG9zcGl0YWxuZXdzLmNvbS9sZWUtaGVhbHRoLW9wZW5zLW1vYmlsZS1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1jbGluaWMtaW4tZHVuYmFyLWNvbW11bml0eS0yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Lee Health Opens Mobile Health Care Clinic in Dunbar Community - Florida Hospital News and Healthcare Report,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://southfloridahospitalnews.com/lee-health-opens-mobile-health-care-clinic-in-dunbar-community-2/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vc291dGhmbG9yaWRhaG9zcGl0YWxuZXdzLmNvbS9sZWUtaGVhbHRoLW9wZW5zLW1vYmlsZS1oZWFsdGgtY2FyZS1jbGluaWMtaW4tZHVuYmFyLWNvbW11bml0eS0yL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,,,

Volvo has acquired Zenseact an autonomous driving hardware and software supplier.

While many automakers now view autonomous driving products as the auto industry’s future recent history has shown that it can be a highly volatile market. A month ago Ford was forced to divest from its autonomous vehicle company after struggling with profitability. Now Volvo hopes to try its hand buying out autonomous driving software and hardware supplier Zenseact.

As initially reported by Reuters Volvo had already purchased the lion’s share of the Zenseact business but has now purchased the remaining shares from minority owner ECARX an autonomous driving supplier in China. Details regarding how much Volvo paid for the shares have not been disclosed. Zenseact is now a 100% subsidiary of Volvo Cars.

Zenseact like other autonomous driving companies primarily serves as a supplier to automakers allowing them to use its self-driving technology in their vehicles. According to the company’s website its OnePilot autonomous driving offering “is AI-powered software for autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems. It combines in-car software and cloud services to offer rigorous protection on the road.”

Most recently Zenseact worked with Volvo to introduce autonomous driving capabilities to the upcoming Volvo EX90 and Polestar 3 electric SUVs. However with the company now becoming a subsidiary of the Swedish automaker many expect more Volvo and Polestar products to receive the same treatment.

It is unclear if Volvo’s investment will result in the technology being shared with its primary shareholder Chinese automaker Geely Motors. But with such a focus on the technology from the industry generally it would be hard to believe Geely wouldn’t take the opportunity.

Zenseact doesn’t list any other automakers as customers on its website. However it specifies that it is working with big names like NVIDIA Hewlett Packard Enterprise and ECARX.

As autonomous driving becomes an ever more common feature in the vehicles people drive the importance and strategic advantage of having a tailored autonomous driving suite will become ever more critical. And with such a notable automaker making this investment it might not be long before brands consider doing the same.

It was here in 1967 that the Beatles met their guru the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. A decade later two people lost their lives and many more were injured when the Hilton was rocked by an IRA bomb and in 2012 the International Olympic Committee set up residence during the London Games. The first skyscraper hotel to be built in the capital it will celebrate 60 eventful years this coming April.

Behind the £1500-a-night rooms and extravagant banquets is a small army of staff who keep the vast operation going.

Every morning the operation springs into action with a meeting between the Hilton’s most senior staff chaired by Matthew Mullan the general manager. They begin with updates on the number of guests staying discuss any issues and share feedback.

Mullan has worked at the Hilton for almost 35 years having helped to run hotels all across the world including in Egypt Barbados Malta and Abu Dhabi. But he started in the hotel business completely by chance. “It was an accident more than anything else” Mullan says. “I had no idea what I wanted to do but I started working in food and beverage and then joined the company as a trainee manager. And I’ve thoroughly enjoyed it.”

One particular memory that stands out for Mullan is hosting a US presidential visit in Belfast. “It was Bill Clinton’s last international trip before he left office” he recalls. “He just carries this fabulous aura around him and when he walked into the lobby of the hotel the whole place went silent.”

During his stay Clinton was specific about what he wanted for dessert. “Clinton wanted blueberry cheesecake so we went over the top with it and every day it was replaced.”

Natalila Brodiak has been working in events at the Hilton for more than a year alongside her daugher-in-law also called Natalila. Having moved to the UK from Ukraine in 2000 Brodiak still has family at home whom she supports including her parents and her eldest son. On her uniform she wears a Ukrainian flag pin. “I’m proud of my country and I wear this pin to show support” Brodiak says. “It’s very important to me.”

Also on the events team is Filipe Seabra who at 79 is one of the Hilton’s longest-serving staff members having worked at the hotel since 1967. Born in Portugal Seabra moved to the UK in the 1960s and began his career at the Four Seasons hotel. “This is my life. Here Hilton is my life. The company the people I work with this is what I love” Seabra says. “The people I work with are the most friendly I’ve come across and it really is a team effort to make sure everything runs smoothly.”

Roy Firth who has been a doorman here for about 11 years says the highlights for him are the people he has met and worked with.

“I don’t feel I could have had such amazing experiences anywhere else” Firth says. “Moments in my career such as meeting the Dalai Lama hosting the Olympic committee and celebrating the diamond and platinum jubilee. I really do feel blessed to have shared in this.

“Our hotel has such a wealth of history and I am extremely proud to be a part of that. To have so many positive experiences with all those that I have met from all walks of life is an amazing bonus.”

On the 28th floor the restaurant Galvin at Windows offers a panoramic view of the London skyline. Its general manager Peter Avis began his career in hospitality as a dishwasher in Miami at only 17 having moved to the US from his home town of Liverpool.

“I didn’t have any formal education and I was told by my school that I should go and get a job with the council and sweep the streets” Avis says. “But when I was 17 my sister got a modelling contract in Miami and I got the chance to go out there with her for three weeks and decided to stay there.”

From there Avis worked at an array of hotels and restaurants before taking up his role at Windows in 2020. His biggest challenge since then has been the current staff shortage – experienced hospitality workers have been in short supply since European workers went home during the coronavirus pandemic and were discouraged from returning by Brexit.

“There’s a hole in the workforce and there is a crisis in hospitality recruitment” Avis says. “But we’ve been developing opportunities to bring in young people who may have otherwise not had the chance to work in our industry such as those with disabilities not because it’s the nice thing to do but because it’s the right thing to do.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm13YWtpbGlzaGkuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy8yMDIzLTAxLTAxL3RoZS1pY29uaWMtaGlsdG9uLWhvdGVsLW5haXJvYmktY2xvc2VzLWl0cy1kb29ycy1hZnRlci01My15ZWFyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Iconic Hilton Hotel Nairobi Closes Its Doors After 53 Years,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm13YWtpbGlzaGkuY29tL2FydGljbGUvYnVzaW5lc3MtbmV3cy8yMDIzLTAxLTAxL3RoZS1pY29uaWMtaGlsdG9uLWhvdGVsLW5haXJvYmktY2xvc2VzLWl0cy1kb29ycy1hZnRlci01My15ZWFyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3E7FD00>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The region’s hotel pipeline continues to grow with both large resorts all-inclusives and boutique hotels of every shape and size continuing to pop up across the islands of the Caribbean.

That will continue in 2023 with a wave of new hotels opening their doors from development powerhouses like the Mexican Caribbean (where new hotels seem to pop up just about every week) to classic beach destinations like Cable Beach and Punta Cana.

We’ve gathered a list of the new Caribbean hotels we’re most excited about in 2023 with some that just opened their doors in the last quarter and a number that will be opening up for the first time this year.

Westin Beach Resort St Thomas US Virgin Islands There is no more significant hotel opening in 2023 than this: the new Westin St Thomas a dramatic transformation of the former Marriott Frenchman’s Reef in St Thomas. Set on the signature hotel site in St Thomas the new Westin Beach Resort and Spa will have 392 rooms (28 suites) broad meeting space and a dazzling pool deck. So much has changed since the original property shuttered after Hurricane Irma in 2017 — and the property now finds itself in one of the booming tourism destinations in the whole Caribbean. It’s now accepting reservations for stays beginning May 15 2023."

""Nobody works. Nobody gives a damn. Just give it to me. Send me money. I don’t want to work — I’m too lazy I’m too fat I’m too stupid"" Marcus said describing the lazy work culture to the Financial Times.

""Outnumbered"" panelists on Monday reacted to the billionaire businessman's comments which caused a stir online.

Fox Weather meteorologist Amy Freeze said the former CEO might be right in his assessment because government handouts enabled an entitlement culture.

PAID NOT TO WORK: VICTOR DAVIS HANSON LAYS OUT THE VALUE OF HARD WORK

""I do think that might be the truth in some situations because people don't feel like they have to work anymore because they can get everything else for free from the government or they're getting paid more to go on the welfare system"" she argued.

""Outnumbered"" host Emily Compagno agreed social media apps like TikTok had taught young people to pursue ""cheap dopamine hits"" and ""get rich quick"" careers as ""influencers"" instead of careers that took years of hard work to see results.

She agreed with Marcus that the government had also killed the entrepreneurial spirit.

""I agree with him that it’s partly the absolute dilution of any type of work ethic on the part of young people and also in combination the overregulation of the government so there’s no incentive to start your own business"" she said.

MIKE ROWE SOUNDS THE ALARM ON A DECLINING WORK ETHIC: ‘THE REFLECTION IS KIND OF HIDEOUS’

FOX Business’ Kennedy added to Freeze's comments saying coronavirus stimulus packages incentivized some Americans to stop working because they were still getting paid.

""People were paid to not work during the pandemic. There's a large swath of people who would love to continue that trend but with a looming recession they will not get that luxury"" she said.

Kennedy added there was an entitlement culture among some Gen Z-ers.

""To Emily's point they don't want the entry-level they want the c-suite!"" she said.

Fox News contributor Dr. Janette Nesheiwat argued capitalism enabled work ethic but government handouts student loan forgiveness and lockdowns harmed it.

""I think you're right. It was exacerbated with the COVID lockdown people got comfortable sitting at home working from home wanting to get paid more and doing less work and that's just not how our country operates"" she said.

""You know I think it's capitalism that helps pave the way out of poverty… if you look at socialism it's governmental control winners versus losers but the government wants to take all your winners and equalize it give it to everyone"" she continued.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZveDVhdGxhbnRhLmNvbS9uZXdzL2hvdy13aGVyZS15b3UtY2FuLXRvLWRpc3Bvc2Utb2YteW91ci1jaHJpc3RtYXMtdHJlZS1pbi1tZXRyby1hdGxhbnRh0gFpaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZm94NWF0bGFudGEuY29tL25ld3MvaG93LXdoZXJlLXlvdS1jYW4tdG8tZGlzcG9zZS1vZi15b3VyLWNocmlzdG1hcy10cmVlLWluLW1ldHJvLWF0bGFudGEuYW1w?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How where to dispose of your Christmas tree in metro Atlanta,"If you spent time putting up decorations this holiday season about now you may be thinking about taking them down.

About 28000 gas ranges have been recalled because the oven can release ""dangerous levels"" of carbon monoxide while in use potentially causing serious injury or even death U.S. consumer safety officials warned.

The recall impacts ZLINE Kitchen and Bath 30-inch and 36-inch RG gas ranges that were sold between February 2019 and December 2022 according to a notice posted on Dec. 29 by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. The kitchen gas ranges sold for between $2300 and $5000.

The CPSC said it has received ""44 reports of carbon monoxide emission including three reports of consumers seeking medical attention.""

Carbon monoxide (CO) an odorless colorless gas kills hundreds of people every year and causes illness to thousands more according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The agency recommends installing battery-operated CO detectors near every sleeping area of the home and be sure to check these detectors regularly to ensure they are functioning properly.

The most common symptoms of CO poisoning are headache dizziness weakness upset stomach vomiting chest pain and confusion the CDC says. People who are sleeping or drunk can die from CO poisoning before they even have symptoms the agency adds.

ZLINE recall: Only gas ranges with these model numbers are affected

The recalled ZLINE gas ranges have the model numbers RG30 RGS-30 RGB-30 RG36 RGS-36 and RGB-36. The model number is printed on a label on the back of the range.

For ranges purchased after 2020 the model number is also printed on a label underneath the right side of the range top visible when the oven door is open CPSC said. The ZLINE logo is printed on the bottom of the door.

The ranges were sold in various door colors including black matte blue gloss blue matte DuraSnow red gloss red matte and white matte the CPSC said. They have multiple finishes including stainless steel black stainless steel and DuraSnow a cloudy steel finish.

The recalled Zline ranges were sold at Best Buy Lowe’s The Home Depot and The Range Hood Store stores nationwide and online at www.bestbuy.com www.build.com www.costco.com www.homedepot.com www.therangehoodstore.com www.overstock.com and www.wayfair.com the CPSC said.

The CPSC said customers should immediately stop using the oven compartment of the recalled ranges until a free repair is available while they can continue using the range tops ""which are unaffected by the issue.""

ZLINE Kitchen and Bath based in Reno Nevada is working to develop repairs for all the affected stoves CPSC said.

Participating in the program represented another step in their ongoing efforts to conserve resources.

""We'd already switched to no-till to reduce soil erosion and inputs like fuel but we wanted to also improve our management of irrigation water help wildlife habitat and do our part to ensure water quality by preventing runoff from our fields"" says Daniel Janski.

Along with his parents Richard and Marlys brother Thomas and cousin Tyler Janski is a partner in Janski Farms LLC. The family manages more than 4400 acres of corn soybeans small grains alfalfa and edible peas and grows cover crops. They also run a 210-cow dairy a 750-head on-farm feedlot and 24 beef cow-calf pairs.

After applying for the program and working with a certifier to identify water-quality risks on their farm and ways to address the risks the Janskis became water-quality certified in 2021. They joined more than 1100 Minnesota farmers who are also certified.

The voluntary Water Quality Certification Program launched in 2016. The program came from brainstorming by representatives of the Minnesota Department of Agriculture USDA the Environmental Protection Agency the Natural Resources Conservation Service and other agencies.

""Because Minnesota is a headwater state — meaning all the water in the state eventually leaves — we decided to take a novel approach to addressing water-quality concerns"" says Brad Jordahl Redlin program manager. ""We decided to create a voluntary opportunity for farmers to take the lead in implementing conservation practices that protect our water.""

The Janski family is experimenting with grazing cover crops.

Farmers in Minnesota can apply for the state program at either their local cooperative or soil and water conservation district (SWCD) office. A program-approved certifier — typically a SWCD employee — schedules an on-farm visit with the applicant.

""The certifier conducts a whole-farm risk assessment to find management areas that might be posing risks to water"" says Redlin. ""If risks are found the certifier and farmer put their heads together to find ways to mitigate these risks. But in the end the farmer finds his or her own path to mitigation of the risks.""

Directing the participant to cost-sharing programs or other sources of technical or financial assistance is also the certifier's role. In some cases the applicant may qualify for a $5000 grant available through the Water Quality Certification Program to help implement practices to better protect water.

Once certified farmers are deemed in compliance for a 10-year period with any new laws enacted relating to agricultural water quality.

For the Janskis the certification process identified three management areas that could lead to continued improvements in their ongoing efforts to better conserve soil and water.

""We've been focusing on making a full conversion to no-till diversifying our crops and cover crops and fine-tuning our pivot irrigation management"" says Janski.

Through the program the Janskis obtained sensors that monitor soil moisture in the soil profile. The sensors help them decide how much water to apply to fields and give an accurate reading of how much they're actually using and applying.

""We used to dig with a shovel to see how much soil moisture there was but this is a much more accurate way of knowing how much water to apply"" says Janski. The sensors also document what the Janskis were already observing but not quantifying: Cover crops conserve moisture.

""We're finding that after termination the cover crop residue on the field preserves soil moisture"" says Janski.

Fine-Tuning Cover Crops

While the Janskis began growing cover crops before applying for water-quality certification participating in the program has helped them fine-tune the process. On fields where cash crops have been harvested by mid-September they plant a multispecies cover crop blend with cereal rye as the main component.

""After about September 20 we will only plant cereal rye as a cover crop"" says Janski. ""We have found that seeding other species at that late a date doesn't always provide enough growing time for them to produce significant growth.

""We're also grazing some of the cover crops but we're in the experimental phase of this"" he says. ""We understand that grazing provides benefits to plants and soil life through the cattle's saliva and their hooves trampling the soil surface.""

Along with including cereal rye as a key component in cover crop mixes the Janskis also look for windows of opportunity in the crop rotation to grow cereal rye as a stand-alone crop for producing grain and straw. They harvest the grain for cover crop seed and use the straw for livestock bedding.

Cover crop alongside corn at Janski Farms.

Long-Term Planning

Since working with their SWCD certifier the Janskis have realized that planning their crop rotation gives them the opportunities they need to better grow the rye for grain and straw.

""We're always looking ahead now at least two years in advance so that we have a plan established for what crop to grow in what field"" says Janski. ""In years past we didn't have a long-term plan.""

They have found that cereal rye harvested from an early-planted crop yields the best. That means finding ways to harvest previous cash crops early enough to provide timely planting of the rye. Sometimes that might mean harvesting a field of corn for silage to make room for planting rye in late summer. Growing an early-maturing variety of soybeans can provide a window of opportunity as well.

Fine-tuning such management efficiencies as those resulting from strategic planning can lead to increased farm profitability for farmers undergoing the water-quality certification process. (See ""Participants More Profitable."")

Enhanced profitability also results from adoption of some conservation practices such as no-till which can potentially lower costs.

""By reducing or eliminating tillage we've saved money on fuel"" says Janski. ""Since converting to full no-till we've cut our fuel use by two tankers a year. And I have heard from others that down the road as our no-till system matures our use of synthetic fertilizers could be less.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Fortunately plenty of companies offer comprehensive plans and fair pricing for self-employed individuals.

Read on for reviews of the best self-employed health insurance plans plus a guide to finding a plan that aligns with your health-related requirements and financial situation.

Our Top Picks for the Best Health Insurance for the Self- Employed

Best Health Insurance for the Self-Employed Reviews

Best for Gold Plans: Blue Cross Blue Shield View Rates

Pros Available in all 50 states and internationally

Expansive provider network

Best value for a Gold plan Cons Difficult to find a servicer in some regions

Customer service varies by region

Why we chose it: Blue Cross Blue Shield is a reputable health insurance company with a huge provider network. Its Gold plan offers comprehensive coverage with low out-of-pocket maximums for self-employed individuals and their families.

We included this company on our list of the best self-employed insurance options for its affordable Gold plans. ""Gold"" health insurance plans offer lower out-of-pocket costs for higher monthly premiums and are generally a good option for people who often use medical services.

Gold plans also benefit self-employed individuals who would rather know up front how much they’re going to spend on healthcare (and fit it into their budgeting plans) even with the higher monthly premiums.

The insurer also has a vast provider network throughout a broad coverage area with around 1.7 million participating doctors and hospitals across the country.

The main drawback of this insurance provider is that it's made up of a network of 35 regional companies. That means customer service can vary by location. For example JD Power ranks Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois as No. 1 for customer satisfaction but it's ranked much lower in California.

Depending on the region this company has A A- or A+ ratings with the credit rating agency AM Best. It also gets an A+ from the Better Business Bureau (BBB).

Physician copays start at $10 and some plans include health and wellness discounts for gym memberships and fitness equipment. You can also add dental insurance for kids and adults to your plan.

Overall Blue Cross Blue Shield provides a dependable option for a self-employed person who wants low premiums and a large provider network.

Best for Premium Tax Credits: Aetna View Rates

Pros Lower your premium costs through the ACA

24/7 virtual care available (starting at $0)

Free or low-cost MinuteClinic services Cons ACA plans have limited coverage areas

More expensive without tax credits

Why we chose it: Aetna's plans are eligible for the maximum premium tax credit meaning you can offset your health insurance costs depending on your income. This option is solid if you’re starting a freelance career and want to access coverage through the Affordable Care Act (ACA).

Aetna offers a variety of HMO PPO and EPO plans with all plans eligible for the maximum premium reduction provided through the Affordable Care Act. That means you can reduce your premium costs based on your income.

For example if you make less than 150% of the federal poverty level you could purchase a Silver plan through Aetna and contribute as little as $0. Unfortunately those tax credits aren't available nationwide. Therefore you should talk to an Aetna agent about your options based on location and income or see your plan options by entering your zip code on Aetna's website.

Another benefit for self-employed professionals on a budget is Aetna's low-cost MinuteClinic services. You can visit a local MinuteClinic for preventive and emergency services for as low as $0. Members can also access 24/7 virtual care for free. For other services physician copays start at $20.

Aetna is not the most affordable option if you don't qualify for premium tax credits through the ACA. However the company has a reputation for dependability with an A rating from AM Best and an A+ from the BBB.

Best Provider Network: United Healthcare View Rates

Pros Expansive provider network

Highly rated customer service

Easy-to-use app for plan information and card Cons Higher-cost premiums for individuals

Limited plan options in some states

Why we chose it: With 1.3 million healthcare providers and over 6500 hospitals United Healthcare's network is one of the most expansive in the country. This company offers health insurance for self-employed people and their families through various products including short-term health insurance supplemental insurance dental and vision coverage.

United Healthcare is available in all 50 states and offers a wide range of insurance products. Qualified individuals can access Medicare and Medicaid plans through United and can receive short-term and supplemental coverage.

This company isn't the cheapest health insurance for a self-employed individual. Average premium costs for a healthy 30-year-old are around $400 with family plans ranging upwards of $1200. However those plans come with access to United’s broad network and extra benefits including wellness discounts and low-cost prescriptions. Copays for primary care visits start at $0.

User reviews for United Healthcare are generally positive as evidenced by@ its A+ rating from the BBB. Its smartphone app which also has high customer ratings allows you to view your health plan details create a digital ID card and manage your prescriptions.

Best for Prescription Home Delivery: Cigna View Rates

Pros Reasonable premiums for individuals

Dental plans are available in all 50 states

Convenient virtual services Cons Health plans aren't available in all states

High rate of complaints for customer service

Why we chose it: Cigna offers affordable health insurance for self-employed individuals in 12 states across the U.S. We chose this company for its convenience and perks including online consultations and home deliveries for prescription medications.

Even though it is not available in all 50 states Cigna offers low-cost HMO and EPO plans as well as fine-tuned online services for self-employed professionals in the following states and district: Arizona California Colorado Connecticut Florida Georgia Maryland Missouri North Carolina South Carolina Tennesse and Washington D.C.

Within the places listed above Cigna works with 1.5 million healthcare providers and facilities plus 67000 pharmacies. It also offers dental coverage and Medicare Part D prescription drug plans in all 50 states.

Cigna’s most appealing features make it convenient for patients to access healthcare. These include access to 24/7 virtual care and prescription delivery. That means Cigna members can chat with their doctor get a prescription and have their medicine delivered without ever leaving home which is a benefit to self-employed individuals who work from home.

On the downside Cigna does not stand out for its customer service. The insurer doesn't have a BBB rating and has a high number of customer complaints. Potential customers should be aware of this before deciding on an insurer.

Best Pricing From a Major Insurer: Molina Healthcare View Rates

Pros Low-cost plans without tax credits

Easy-to-use mobile app

Free virtual services included in most plans Cons Lower-than-usual third-party ratings

No dental coverage

Why we chose it: If you're looking for low-cost coverage without an employer Molina is worth looking into. Its Bronze and Silver plans have some of the most affordable options on the market and still offer comprehensive coverage.

Molina Healthcare challenges the rule that cheaper health insurance isn't necessarily better. Typically a low-cost plan with limited coverage won't help much when you need to see a doctor. However Molina Healthcare is a major insurer that offers dependable coverage for a low premium.

While Molina is available in all 50 states its ACA plans are only available in 14 states. Even without ACA assistance you can buy a Bronze or Silver plan without overpaying (for a healthy 30-year-old premiums can cost around $200 to $300 varying by location). Physician copays start at $0.

Most plans come with free virtual visits and low-cost prescriptions. Molina has a modern app that members can use to talk to a nurse or to learn more about their plan. This company has a B rating from AM Best slightly lower than average for a major insurance provider.

Best for PPO Plans: Humana View Rates

Pros Well-rated for Medicare Advantage plans

Good for family plans

Flexibility to choose your provider Cons Medicaid plans are only available in two states

Poor customer service

Why we chose it: Humana offers flexible PPO plans with wide coverage options worth considering if you want to stick with your primary care provider but don't want higher premiums.

Humana targets individuals who want to stick with a particular provider. One of the toughest parts of switching insurance companies is finding doctors and hospitals you trust in your new network. PPO plans simplify this issue at a higher cost than HMOs or EPOs.

Humana has flexible relatively low-cost PPO plans available all over the country. With Medicare Advantage Humana plans start at $0 per month. That's one reason why older Americans choose this insurance company.

Although Humana's PPO plans allow you to choose your physician you'll save more money if you stay in the company's network. That network is extensive with thousands of physicians in every state. Physician copays start at $0. With Medicare Advantage you can pay around $30 per month for a PPO plan.

Humana has an A- rating from AM Best and an A+ from the BBB higher than average customer satisfaction ratings for a major insurance provider.

Best for Free 24/7 Urgent Care: Oscar View Rates

Pros Virtual services with a $0 copay

Convenient app

Low-cost plan options Cons Not available in all 50 states

High rate of customer complaints

Why we chose it: If you want the peace of mind that comes with 24/7 virtual care you might want to consider Oscar. This is a modernized healthcare company that lets you talk with a doctor and get a prescription anytime without leaving home.

Oscar stands out because its virtual urgent care is available 24/7 through the mobile app. It's fast convenient and free with most Oscar plans. A lot of health insurance companies today offer virtual services but most don’t offer it 24/7.

The downside is that Oscar is currently only available in 22 states. However all plans in those states are eligible for subsidies through the ACA. Without subsidies a healthy 30-year-old might pay around $300 to $400 for a Bronze or Silver plan with Oscar (costs vary by location).

The Oscar app allows members to track their deductible talk to a physician and refill prescriptions anytime. It also has some interactive wellness features like a step counter. While the app is rated at 4.7/5 stars the company receives a high rate of complaints. It has an A- rating from the BBB and 1/5 stars from its customer reviews.

Other health insurance we considered

Freelancers Union is not a health insurance company but it does help freelancers connect and learn more about health insurance for the self-employed. As a Freelancers Union member you can shop for plans and enroll through their website.

Pros Connects freelancers to health insurance plans

Free to join Cons Not an actual health insurance company

Plan options vary by location

Kaiser Permanente is one of the most popular employer-sponsored healthcare companies on the market but it isn’t the best for individual plans. The cost of health insurance for self-employed people with Kaiser can get pricy. However Kaiser has a dependable health network and comprehensive coverage if you can afford it.

Pros Convenient health centers for all services

Free virtual services Cons Individual plans can be expensive

Restricted to in-network care

The Affordable Care Act also known as Obamacare is a federal program that provides subsidized healthcare for low-income households. You can shop for a healthcare plan that fits your income and family size on the ACA marketplace. The ACA might be the best place to start if you’re looking for a health insurance plan for self-employed workers with (often significant) tax deductions.

Pros Healthcare premiums as low as $0

Health Insurance for the Self-Employed Guide

Shopping for health insurance shouldn't be complicated. A good plan should have a manageable balance between deductibles premiums and coverage. After deciding which marketplace you want look for companies with a simple claims process group plans or other applicable perks. Remember that health care might seem overpriced but out-of-pocket medical bills are a leading cause of American consumer bankruptcy so choose wisely.

To begin you must know which type of health insurance plan you want.

Types of health insurance plans

With employer-sponsored health insurance you generally have one or two plans to choose from. These plans are often explained to you by an HR representative. For independent contractors it's a little trickier. However it would be best to understand the different types of plans so you know what to pick.

Let's start by breaking down the difference between standard plan types.

HMO (health maintenance organization)

An HMO plan restricts your healthcare options to a predefined network of providers. That means less freedom to choose your doctor or hospital but comparatively lower premiums and deductibles than other types of plans.

Under an HMO you typically have a primary care provider who will refer you to other specialists within the network. Most insurers allow you to browse their network online to find an in-network doctor you like.

While you may have access to some free services or have a small copay per visit if you visit an in-network healthcare provider you won’t be covered and would have to pay completely out of pocket if you see a doctor or go to a hospital outside your HMO network.

PPO (preferred provider organization)

A PPO offers a little more flexibility than an HMO when choosing a provider. With this plan you don't need a referral from your primary care physician to see a specialist and you can also see doctors outside your network though you will pay a slightly higher cost.

PPO plans generally have higher premiums than HMOs and require a little more paperwork. For example you may have to submit a claim yourself when you see an out-of-network doctor.

EPO (exclusive provider organization)

With an EPO plan you don't need a referral to see a specialist but you are restricted to your provider network. You'll have to pay out of pocket for any out-of-network services (unless it's an emergency).

This type of plan is a good option if you want specialist care without a referral but don't want to pay extra for a PPO.

POS (point of service)

A POS plan brings together the benefits of PPO with those of an HMO. This plan type means you have a primary care physician who coordinates your services but you can still get some coverage for out-of-network specialists.

With a POS you will have to pay up front for out-of-network care. Then you can submit a claim to your insurer for reimbursement.

Metal levels

Health insurance companies rank their plans in ""metal"" levels: Bronze Silver Gold and Platinum.

The higher the metal level the higher the premium. Conversely higher-tier plans come with lower deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums. If you choose a Gold or Platinum plan you'll pay more per month but less overall for emergency and preventive services.

If you're looking for an IRS self-employment health insurance deduction for a higher-tier plan you'll want to talk to an insurance agent about your medical history. Most ACA and state programs offer low-cost Bronze or Silver plans but make exceptions for people with disabilities or pre-existing conditions.

Where to find health insurance for the self-employed

So what is the best health insurance for self-employed professionals? It varies from person to person. Every health plan has pros and cons. However the best health insurance for self-employed family members and individuals comes down to several factors including your income location and health condition just to name a few.

Begin by comparing your options. Below we've listed a few places you can look for health plans in your area.

Health insurance marketplaces

We mentioned a few health insurance marketplaces in the list above: Freelancers Union and the ACA marketplace but there are also regional and state marketplaces. For example California residents can browse subsidized plans through Covered California.

Remember that a marketplace is not an insurance company; you'll browse plans from different companies. Therefore it’s important to read the benefits and costs of each plan carefully.

State government programs

Under the Affordable Care Act each state has its own sponsored health insurance program. Searching for plans specific to your state will help you to narrow down your options and make sure you're getting the correct assistance.

Federal government programs

Aside from the ACA a few more federal programs can provide discounted health insurance options for self-employed professionals. Those include:

Medicare – A federally-sponsored insurance for adults 65 and older. Medicare beneficiaries generally pay a small monthly premium based on their income.

Medicaid – A needs-based health insurance not provided by an employer. To qualify most states require an individual to make 138% of the federal poverty level. Medicaid can be a practical option for someone with pre-existing conditions who needs immediate coverage but can't afford an individual plan.

Military programs

TRICARE is a government-funded healthcare program for military members and their families that provides affordable health insurance to eligible individuals. Depending on your household income and health conditions you can often access discounted or free healthcare plans.

Membership organizations

One way to find the best health insurance plans for self-employed people is to connect with a union or membership organization such as the aforementioned Freelancers Union. Other alternatives include:

AARP

Writers Guild of America

Small Business Service Bureau

National Association of Female Executives

Some of these organizations offer group plans which offset the cost of health insurance without an employer.

How We Chose the Best Health Insurance for the Self Employed

We selected the seven insurance companies on this list based on their value for self-employed workers. Here are a few factors we considered:

Overall value

How much is health insurance for self-employed individuals? Again the answer varies based on need.

However we compared companies with the coverage provided and how much that costs. While some of the companies reviewed on this list are more expensive than others they also provide more comprehensive coverage meaning members get what they pay for.

State availability

Unfortunately not all health insurance plans are available in all 50 states. Health insurance companies like Cigna have limited availability based on location.

That said most of the companies reviewed on this list offer at least some plans in every state. Check out their websites to see which plans exist in your area.

Member support

Health insurance can feel complicated. That's why helpful resources and customer service are essential factors in a good healthcare plan. Look for a health insurance company that offers online guidance virtual care or customer service availability to help you understand your plan.

Plan features

The features of your healthcare plan should be straightforward to understand. Your provider should clarify your copay for primary care visits deductibles and out-of-pocket maximum.

On top of that the best health insurance companies provide plenty of benefits with each plan including virtual care and wellness discounts.

A post won’t do,"It seems that 2023 is poised to be a year of legislative initiatives that will set Israel years back when it comes to human rights. To prevent this from happening much more needs to be done than posting on social media. Don’t get me wrong a public condemnation against discrimination is very important; but much more meaningful action has to be taken in order to neutralise the damage that the upcoming Knesset can incur in Israel’s human rights and civil rights arena.

If there is an area that Israel’s new leadership understands and cares about it’s a stable economy and international affairs. The Start-Up Nation hosts over 400 R&D centres of global multinational corporations across the country. Imagine a scenario where the tech talent from Israel’s high-tech companies were to go on strike in the event that legislation harming human rights were to be passed. This would reduce the market’s productivity. Now imagine that their global headquarters go one step further and publish a harsh global statement against Israel’s discriminating new policy.

1 View gallery Eyal Goldman. ( Or Kaplan )

Does this sound like an unlikely scenario? In July 2018 the LGBTECH NGO led a massive strike and protest against the “surrogacy law” and took hundreds of companies with them. At the time I was IBM Israel’s Spokesperson and the local media asked whether IBM supported the strike. The answer was not only an adamant yes but the IBM headquarters in New York also released an official statement and encouraged the Apple headquarters and other large MNCs to release a similar harsh comment. The issue became a ‘global headache’ and a much more difficult one to handle.

While statements are important a buzz saw in Israel’s economy can be a much more tangible threat. If the local tech ecosystem wants to safeguard human rights in Israel its tech leaders should articulate a clear policy in case the government tables or passes discriminating legislation. By most global standards ethical professionals don’t work in places where there is discrimination. Clients partners or suppliers who don’t respect basic human rights go into the blacklist. It is time for the Israeli high-tech ecosystem to embrace this global standard – even if they are not obligated to do so.





Another step in this direction can be to offer each tech worker the option of taking a ‘strike day’ for a certain number of days or half-days during a given year. This would be implemented when that worker feels human rights violations are at stake and gives them the opportunity to march protest or volunteer. A strong demonstration of a company’s core values would be shown by senior management marching alongside their colleagues and speaking out publicly against discrimination. By doing so a much more lasting impact can be achieved; the company’s executives will receive much more credit from their teams while strengthening their employee brand.

DailyMail.com photos and videos show the lawyer of Madalina's stepfather and two men believed to be private investigators checking out the burn pit on Friday

The firepit where the family of missing 11-year-old North Carolina girl Madalina Cojocari allegedly burned couch cushions after the little girl disappeared is now the focus of the investigation DailyMail.com has learned.

Brandon Roseman the lawyer for Madelina's stepfather Christopher Palmiter was seen examining the pit with two men believed to be private investigators on Friday.

The three men pulled up around noon Friday and walked through the backyard then proceeded up a staircase through a rear gate leading to the secluded fire pit exclusive photos and videos by DailyMail.com show. They gathered around the black charred circle that burned for several days in late November.

Only after noticing the DailyMail.com reporter watching from outside did they step away from the pit. They then examined a patio umbrella in the backyard before entering the two-story brick house spending an hour in the now-shuttered home and garage before wrapping up.

The two investigators tried to hide their faces from DailyMail.com's cameras as they emerged with one of them carrying what appeared to be a cat carrier. The family owns several cats.

The mother of Madalina Cojocari says she last saw her on November 23 – three weeks before she reported the 11-year-old girl missing to her school. The family lit a fire allegedly to torch couch cushions and other items in the days after Madalina disappeared

Palmiter 60 and Madalina's mom Diana Cojocari 37 have been charged with failure to report a missing child and continue to be held on $250000 and $200000 bond respectively. Police accused them of continuing to withhold information now six weeks since the girl was last seen.

The case has prompted anger and bewilderment among locals in Cornelius an affluent town just north of Charlotte that the couple has called home since 2017.

'It's like living in the middle of a true crime documentary' one neighbor told DailyMail.com.

The couple has always been considered an oddity.

Cojocari emigrated from the impoverished Eastern European nation of Moldova where she reportedly participated in a reality TV show on weight loss in 2014. She showed off her engagement ring on the program and there's also a glimpse of a little girl believed to be Madalina.

'They didn't know each other before the engagement' Iosefina Pascal a Romanian journalist who did some research on Cojocari's life in Moldova told news station WCCB Charlotte. 'So all of this was abrupt and sudden.

'You meet a guy online he's like 40 years older than you he comes to Moldova you suddenly get engaged.'

Palmiter is actually 23 years Cojocari's senior.

He worked as a mechanical designer at industrial machinery manufacturer Ingersoll Rand in North Carolina according to his LinkedIn page though he told neighbors that he was laid off in 2020 and was working for another company an hour outside town.

He also ran an etching business out of his garage using a laser to engrave products and selling his works online.

Madalina's mother Diana Cojocari 37 and stepfather Christopher Palmiter 60 were arrested on December 17. Cojocari claims she last saw her daughter at 10pm on November 23 Palmiter thinks he didn't see her for a full week before making a trip to Michigan on November 24

Investigators searched Madalina's family home where her mother claims she was last seen going to bed. 'It's like living in the middle of a true crime documentary' one neighbor in the affluent town of Cornelius North Carolina told DailyMail.com

Locals described Palmiter as a far-right deep state propagandist who'd fill his Facebook feed with pictures of armed warriors the American flag bible quotes and anti-Biden vitriol. He also shared links to deep state podcasts with neighbors.

'When any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it' he wrote in one posting January 30 2022.

He boasted to neighbors about owning a cache of guns and during the George Floyd protests threatened to use his weapons if any protester showed up at his house.

'He had a s**t ton of guns and said if anything went down he'd be ready' a neighbor said. 'I mentioned that to the officers. But they said they didn't find any firearms in the home.'

Cojocari for her part described herself on LinkedIn as an independent beauty consultant selling Mary Kay Cosmetics. However neighbors said they'd never seen her selling. In fact they said she'd rarely be seen in public.

'She was quiet reserved' one neighbor said. 'We'd see her outside once in a while but she really would not make eye contact. I got kind of an icy feeling from her but I really couldn't put my finger on it.

'I'd mostly just see the stepdad and the daughter. I thought that was a little bit odd.'

It was Palmiter who'd be seen strolling with Madalina through the neighborhood wearing a Michigan State sweatshirt as she played with toys. He was the one who took her trick-or-treating on Halloween.

Madalina was last seen exiting a school bus at her stop on November 21 police say

Police accused Madalina's mom and step dad of continuing to withhold information now six weeks since the girl was last seen

'We've seen him and the little girl walking around a lot' another woman who lives just down the block told DailyMail.com. 'She would have a Barbie car she'd be walking with or some other toy. Then he'd be at the pool with the girl.

'When I saw him with her he always seemed normal' she continued. 'He was so much older I always thought he was either single or he was her grandfather. I never knew what the relationship was about.'

'I never saw the mom' she noted. 'Maybe once like five years ago.'

Residents learned more about Cojocari from recent police reports and news media than they did during their seven years as neighbors. Some have joined local chat groups to exchange gossip on the couple.

On Cojocari's Facebook page one message in particular raised eyebrows – a July 2020 audio posting in which she shares her belief that humans are inherently violent. It made them think of her recent arrest report which states she told cops that she didn't report the disappearance because she feared how her husband would react.

'If you say violence is bad that means you will end up rejecting a part of yourself and you can never get rid of it because it will not go it will come out in so many ways' she states on Facebook.

'People are very peaceful on the streets but pretty violent at home. If they are not capable of physical violence they are verbally violent or they are violent in their thoughts or emotions or so many other ways.'

Cojocari said the only remedy is meditation stating 'You will find peace in your heart your mind and your soul.'

Cojocari's Facebook page states that she studied at the University of the Spirit.

An arrest report obtained by DailyMail.com reveals Madalina had been missing for three weeks when her mother reported her missing

'I heard through the grapevine they practiced some weird religion and I mentioned this to the FBI' one neighbor told DailyMail.com. 'One of the investigators responded 'Oh yeah there's definitely some sun worshipping going on in there.'

Before the arrests the couple's greatest issue with locals came from a more mundane issue – they had an abundance of cats that would roam the streets drawing complaints from the neighborhood association.

Madalina was last seen on November 21 leaving a school bus and according to her mother vanished on November 23.

But Cojocari did not report her daughter's disappearance until December 15.

She told police that on the day she vanished she'd argued with her husband and that he drove in anger that evening to his former hometown in Michigan.

She said she didn't tell her husband that the girl was missing until three days later when he returned home to North Carolina.

Investigators noted that the kitchen in the family home had an area blocked with plywood. Palmiter said that he had been building a separate apartment.

He also told police he last saw Madalina a week before she disappeared.

Cojocari said that Madalina's backpack and some of her clothes were missing from the home.

She told police that the young girl did not have any friends that she would stay with and being from Moldova she did not have family in the area.

Cojocari added that she had been in touch with relatives in Moldova who advised her to go to the police – but she resisted.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5ld3puZXcuY29tL3NoYWR5YW50cmEtMi13ZWItc2VyaWVzLTIwMjItZHJlYW0tZmlsbXMtY2FzdC1jcmV3LXJlbGVhc2UtZGF0ZS1yb2xlcy1yZWFsLW5hbWVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Shadyantra 2 Web Series (2022) Dream Films: Cast Crew Release Date Roles Real Names,"Shadyantra 2 Web Series (2022) Dream Films: Cast Crew Release Date Roles Real Names: Shadyantra 2 is an Indian web series from Dream Films.

When we did this we found an interesting quirk to Intel’s drivers that prevented installation leaving us with a dreaded Windows 11 Ethernet Controller without a driver. As part of the process we found a workaround we thought we would share with our users since this is unsupported but it has now worked through multiple driver revisions.

How to Install an Intel E810 100GbE Network Adapter in Windows 11

A quick primer Intel has a number of Ethernet adapters. Usually we see the “i” series such as the i210 i225/i226 i350 and so forth used for the 1GbE-2.5GbE generation. The “X5” series came next with adapters like the X520 X540 and X550 and is generally the 10GbE generation. Next was the “X7” generation with NICs like the X710’s but also the XXV710’s and X722’s that were part of the company’s 40GbE generation that also encompassed 10GbE and some 25GbE offerings (XXV.) Now we have the E810 generation where we generally see 100GbE and 25GbE offerings.

In Linux this is easy. The drivers are as follows:

igb – 1GbE for the “i” series

ixgbe – 10GbE for the “X5” series

i40e – 40GbE for the “X7” series

ice – 100GbE for the “E810” series

In Windows there are some differences. For example the X540-T2 uses the Intel IXT driver so technically Windows 11 is not supported. The newer X550-T2 uses the IXS driver and Windows 11 client is supported. When we get to the newer E810 series cards things are more complex to say the least. Here is the official support list as of when we are publishing this article.

Windows 11 or more broadly “Windows Client” is not supported. Most users know the trick. Download the latest Windows Server 2022 drivers install and everything should work.

That process was a bit different in this case. The Intel E810-XXVDA4 quad 25GbE adapter was installed without an issue.

Even though that was installed the Intel E810-CQDA2 was still showing up as an Ethernet Controller.

That was a bit of a challenge since we wanted the 100GbE adapter to work as well. We tried up to “Wired_driver_27.8_x64” released 2022-12-29 but this has been the same for several versions we tried with this system.

The answer was a bit strange but we found a workaround. Instead of the normal 37.5MB Windows driver pack one instead needs the 795.2MB Intel Ethernet Adapter Complete Pack (we used 27.8). Then one can manually install the driver by simply:

Download Release_27.8.zip (or presumably newer when available)

Extract the zipped folder which will be called “Release_27.8” or newer

In Device Manager click Update driver and point at the extracted “Release_27.8” folder with the subfolder option checked

Doing that easy process got us to a working setup:

With that we finally have Intel 10Gbase-T 25GbE and 100GbE all in the same system.

Final Words

On the one hand this is an unsupported configuration. On the other hand with 32+ core desktop PCs these days and in an era with $5000+ professional GPUs getting 100GbE networking is not as expensive as it once was. We just showed a MikroTik CRS518-16XS-2XQ-RM switch that offers affordable 16x 25GbE and 2x 100GbE making a higher-speed network attainable and we are going to have a sub $800 100GbE switch option on STH very soon. As a result we see more of our readers potentially trying this. It is a bit silly that the 25GbE adapter was installed fairly easily but the 100GbE E810 adapter required a less obvious installation route.

Hopefully this helps some of our readers install an Intel E810 100GbE adapter on Windows 11 in the future.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzAxLzAyL2FtZC13aWxsLWhvbGQtMS1rZXktYWR2YW50YWdlLW92ZXItaW50ZWwtZm9yLW11Y2gv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,AMD Will Hold 1 Key Advantage Over Intel for Much of 2023,"AMD is sitting pretty in the server CPU market.

While Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -0.31%) is facing challenges in the PC CPU market with weak demand for PCs and tough competition from Intel (INTC -0.80%) hurting sales the server CPU market is a different story. Intel has long dominated this lucrative market but the company has faced severe execution problems over the past couple of years. Those missteps have opened the door for AMD and AMD has certainly taken advantage.

Intel is finally set to launch its heavily delayed Sapphire Rapids server CPUs in January but the product line is so late that it's unlikely to dramatically change the balance of power in the server CPU market. AMD should be in good shape for much of 2023.

Winning with Genoa

Reviewers at Tom's Hardware called AMD's latest Genoa server CPUs a ""slam dunk"" in November. The chips use a 5-nanometer (nm) manufacturing process enabling them to deliver huge gains in efficiency and performance. In fact Tom's Hardware found that AMD's Genoa chips beat Intel badly in terms of total cost of ownership an important metric for power-hungry chips running 24/7 in data centers.

The size of the performance and efficiency gap between AMD's Genoa and Intel's server lineup is partly the result of huge delays on Intel's part. Intel's Sapphire Rapids server CPUs which are now officially set to launch on Jan. 10 were originally supposed to launch in late 2021. This delay of more than a year has exaggerated AMD's advantages.

Intel ran into all sorts of problems with Sapphire Rapids partly because the product line introduces a raft of new features and functionalities. Sapphire Rapids will ship with four special-purpose accelerators built in ramping up the complexity but positioning the chips to perform well for a wide variety of workloads. One such workload is AI inference which Sapphire Rapids can accelerate without requiring a GPU or other stand-alone accelerator.

Intel reportedly had to fix some 500 hardware bugs over the course of developing Sapphire Rapids and the chips required 12 revisions to get to the finish line. Each of those revisions cost tens of millions of dollars and pushed back the launch date leading Intel to where it is today.

While we don't have third-party performance figures for Sapphire Rapids yet given how late the chips are to the party it's unlikely they'll blow AMD's Genoa out of the water for general-purpose workloads. Specialty workloads that can take advantage of those built-in accelerators are a different story but Genoa seems likely to hold on to the performance crown for the time being.

Intel is getting aggressive

While Sapphire Rapids clogged up the server CPU pipeline for Intel the company is planning a barrage of product launches over the next two years. Before 2023 ends the company expects to launch the successor to Sapphire Rapids currently called Emerald Rapids. Emerald Rapids will be built on the same Intel 7 node as Sapphire Rapids but the upcoming chips are rumored to feature a higher core count and potentially a newer microarchitecture.

In 2024 Intel is shooting to launch two new lines of server CPUs. The first Granite Rapids will be the successor to Emerald Rapids. Granite Rapids will be built on Intel's more advanced Intel 3 node assuming that node is ready for mass production by then. While Emerald Rapids will likely bring modest improvements Granite Rapids represents Intel's best chance to steal the performance crown back from AMD.

In addition to Granite Rapids Intel plans to roll out the efficiency-minded Sierra Forest processor family in 2024. These chips will feature less powerful cores instead focusing on higher core counts and maximizing performance per watt. For certain types of cloud-based workloads that will be a potent combination.

Of course AMD won't be sitting still. Specialized variants of its current-gen server processors are coming next including the ultra-powerful 128-core Bergamo chip aimed at heavy-duty cloud workloads. By the end of 2024 AMD expects to have rolled out its next-gen Turin family of server CPUs which will likely go head-to-head with Intel's Granite Rapids.

While 2024 is shaping up to be an interesting and competitive year in the server CPU market AMD is in a great position going into 2023. Sapphire Rapids will close the gap for Intel but the litany of problems that have bogged down development doesn't inspire much confidence. AMD should have no trouble winning server CPU market share from Intel throughout 2023 although a potential slowdown in the cloud computing market could limit sales growth.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMigwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5uZXdhcmthZHZvY2F0ZS5jb20vc3RvcnkvbmV3cy8yMDIzLzAxLzAxL2ludGVsLW5vdC1qdXN0LWEtdGVzdC1idXQtZmluYWwtZXhhbS1mb3ItcGxhbm5lcnMtbG9jYWwtb2ZmaWNpYWxzLzY5NzUyNzM2MDA3L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Intel not just a test but final exam for planners local officials,"NEWARK – For decades Licking County has been anticipating a surge in growth and development on its western edge eventually spreading countywide.

The pace of that growth has increased sharply in recent years with Google Amazon Facebook and several others coming here testing how well the county has prepared.

But the Jan. 21 announcement that Intel Corporation planned to build a $20 billion computer chip manufacturing facility on 1000 acres of Jersey Township land annexed into New Albany just south of Johnstown feels like the final exam.

It’s the largest commercial development in state history and could grow to a $100 billion project. Intel plans to hire at least 3000 to work at its fabs but 7000 construction workers will be needed. and the development will create 10000 indirect jobs.

The groundbreaking event on Sept. 9 brought President Joe Biden U.S. senators and representatives the Ohio State University president  Gov. Mike DeWine the OSU marching band and numerous other local state company and federal officials. Production is scheduled to begin at two Intel fabs in 2025 so although Licking County's final exam has begun its grades won't be known for years.

“Everybody has been predicting this and here it is"" Licking County Commissioner Tim Bubb said. ""It’s exciting. We’ve been growing but this puts an exclamation point on it. Like what Delaware County went through but more orderly and predictable growth.

""This represents over the next decade an opportunity for the next generation we couldn’t have dreamed would exist in this area. It will make a difference in their lives. Career opportunities are going to be here. You’ll have kids who moved away from central Ohio with degrees they’ll be looking right back at central Ohio. The airplanes fly both directions.”

The development will test the county's ability not only to provide the employees but all aspects of life -- housing for all the workers education for their children a reliable transportation network and public transit utilities police and fire protection recreation entertainment options and retail stores.

State Sen. Jay Hottinger R-Newark said such a massive development into a traditionally rural area comes with pros and cons. He said the employment opportunities are staggering with annual salaries expected to average $135000.

“In my 31-year public-service career it’s always been about jobs economic development and growth"" Hottinger said at the groundbreaking. ""This is larger than Honda and Wright Patterson combined. That puts it in perspective.

""Traffic homes landscape will change but I will argue that’s a heck of a lot better than the alternative. I have seen stagnant areas. I represent some stagnant areas. You can’t stand still. There are problems and growing pains that come from growth. I’m not going to sit here and tell you know it’s going to be problem-free but those problems will be addressed and we’ll mitigate them as best we can.”

Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger told The Advocate at the Sept 9 groundbreaking that finding employees will be critical. The county's unemployment rate tied an all-time low in November at 2.7%

“Talent is a huge issue"" Gelsinger said ""Talent is always a challenge. I am always concerned about that. The talent we’re announcing today those programs we won’t need for 4-5 years and that’s perfect. That’s why we’re launching the programs today.”

Intel met with representatives from Ohio’s 23 two-year colleges in May. At the meeting the schools shared their curricula and Intel shared what it will look for in future employees. This gave the two-year colleges the opportunity to make curricular adjustments that would better prepare students for engineering careers with Intel.

Since the May meeting COTC and Intel have established what COTC President John Berry describes as a “standing connection.” Communication comes with incentive on both sides: Just as Berry wants COTC students to have opportunities with Intel Intel needs to hire a lot of workers many of whom Smith says will come from two-year colleges.

Framework project enters Phase 2

The Evans Foundation stepped up to provide a public-private planning effort called Framework to prepare for Intel. The effort includes 15 governmental jurisdictions and private sector business partners seeking solutions on a variety of issues. It seeks to align communities most immediately impacted by Intel’s construction.

Evans Foundation chairwoman Sarah Wallace announced the formation of the Licking County planning effort in June following initial meetings in April. She provided an update on Dec. 9.

Wallace said the three-phase process is moving into the second phase which is analyzing public input and conducting technical research for the plan. This phase will continue into the spring.

The final phase of developing a strategy should be completed in the summer she said.

From Oct. 1 to Dec. 9 the Framework project received 1688 responses from a survey and input sought at a variety of locations including football games farmers’ markets service club meetings on social media and special events hosted at local businesses and educational institutions.

“It was much more than we anticipated” Wallace said of the response. “We are real happy with it. We have worked really hard.

“We got a lot of comments about schools and greenspace and how people care about the atmosphere in their community and retaining that small-town feel.”

Initially it was thought Intel would attract 30 to 40 suppliers new to central Ohio. Wallace said that may not be the case.

“Probably not more than 12 to 15 (new ones)"" Wallace said. ""A lot of those suppliers we already have.”

Intel has already set aside 200 to 300 acres for supply chain companies within its 1000 acres Wallace said.

Housing key element

Kevin Hively founder of Ninigret Partners is doing extensive research in partnership with Planning NEXT on the housing market Wallace said.

The housing crunch may not be as bad as some expect Wallace said because the Intel employees will find housing all over central Ohio. Currently more people work in Licking County and live outside the county (33000) than those who live and work in the county (27000).

Still housing demand may drive up housing prices too much for some to afford.

“We think we have a lot of people who can’t afford to downsize because there won’t be a lot of places to move to"" Wallace said. ""We hope senior citizens can afford to live in their communities.

“This is where diverse housing options need to be there. We have a pretty good stock of houses but we can’t just build half-million dollar houses.""

Hively said 61% of the new housing units will be for prospective new residents with incomes higher than the current median household income of $71058.

Wallace said the study shows the county needs more housing units now to meet demand it needs the right mix of diverse housing options and affordability will be an issue for some

""There will be a pool of new residents who will have affordability issues"" the foundation report states. ""In order for a community to have a healthy housing mix we should have opportunities for residents to step up and step down over the course of their lives and stay in our community.

“An important thing to make sure everybody understands what diversity in housing means and how it can serve all the population. It’s so important.”

Of the county's population 38% are at the “empty nest/downsize” phase of life and 30% is “retired/aging in place.""

Ouro Pizzaria is a new concept from Gabriella Grant-Spangler and Ben Spangler the couple behind Bebe Zito ice cream and one of the two duos overseeing the food program at Eat Street Crossing. (Zen Box Izakaya's John Ng and Lina Goh are the Spanglers' partners.)

Brazilian pizza which is ""known for elaborate traditional and nontraditional toppings"" both sweet and savory according to a release is near and dear to Grant-Spangler. Her parents are both from Brazil where Italian and Japanese immigrants both influenced a homegrown style of pizza.

Grant-Spangler's family was among those Italian immigrants in Brazil and with Ouro Pizzaria she strives to deliver ""an accurate and nuanced representation of Brazilian food in the Minneapolis culinary scene"" and to honor the legacy of her grandparents.

Grant-Spangler's husband Ben Spangler is the chef. The former pastry chef at Zelo and opening chef at Milkjam Creamery Spangler has made Bebe Zito's inventive flavors into instant icons on the Twin Cities' ice cream scene.

On the Ouro Pizzaria menu look for traditional pizzas with cheese and oregano and dessert pizzas with chocolate fresh fruit and doce de leite. Rounding out the menu are salads and other Brazilian street food.

The fast-casual pizzaria will be part of the much-anticipated Eat Street Crossing food hall.

A former interior designer Grant-Spangler developed a brand that is ""rooted in the Brazilian modernist movement bossa nova jazz and natural elements of the country."" She wants the new space to be a significant departure from what the Twin Cities knows of as Brazilian food — steakhouses. ""Oura Pizzaria better articulates how Brazilians feel"" she said. ""Being Brazilian is a different way of thinking and a lively approach to life.""

Ouro means gold in Portuguese.

One of the most anticipated openings of the new year Eat Street Crossing is a 15000-square-foot food hall inside the Old Arizona Studio (2821 Nicollet Av. S.). It will contain six concepts some new and some already existing plus one cohesive bar program when it opens sometime in winter 2023. Among the expected tenants are an outpost of Uptown-based Bebe Zito the casual Ramen Shoten from Ng and Goh and a Chatime tea.

Images of Iceland more often focus on its striking blue thermal baths stunning barren landscapes magical waterfalls and wild seaside vistas. Rarely do we see or hear about the vast green forests that were once ubiquitous on this Island nation.

When humans first reached Iceland 1150 years ago the landscape looked very different from how it does now. Scientists estimate that between 25 and 40% of the island was covered in forests. As humans used the trees for building boats homes and fires and grazed sheep on the deforested land the woodlands dwindled. Now just 1.5% of Iceland remains forested.

With the forests gone the elements have taken their toll on the environment creating vast deserts and swaths of degraded soil that continue to grow as the high winds whip across the land. This is where the organization Mossy Earth is stepping in helping to reforest and rewild Iceland’s landscape by reversing this desertification returning trees to its soils and helping to restore a landscape from the foundation up.

Desertification in a land of Glaciers and Snow?

When you hear the word “desertification” the places that spring to mind are probably not also famous for their glacial lakes complete with icebergs. But desertification isn’t just for the hottest places in the world. As soil quality degrades because of overgrazing deforestation and top soil eroding away it becomes more difficult for new vegetation to grow. Without vegetation to lock water into the ground or keep soils from blowing away these barren deserts continue to expand across the landscape. After centuries of this process taking place in Iceland 40% of the country has become a desert of sand and volcanic glass.

Not only does desertification significantly change the terrain of landscape it makes it nearly impossible for ecosystems to recover on their own. Native species no longer thrive. Soils can no longer support plants for agriculture. Dust storms become commonplace. Ecosystems are forced to change and adapt.

For a place that has been so long without its forests it can be difficult to imagine the landscape looking any different than its current almost martian vistas. Luckily the forests that still remain give us a glimpse of rich biodiversity that these once prolific habitats can sustain.

Bringing Back Iceland’s Native Forests

Often these days the outcomes of tree planting efforts are measured by how much carbon dioxide these trees will remove from our atmosphere. But Mossy Earth’s approach is different. While carbon sequestration is important their primary focus lies instead on restoring native ecosystems (which naturally sequester carbon of course!) By fostering vibrant native ecosystems that restore balance to environments that need it carbon sequestering becomes a happy side-effect rather than a primary focus.

In Iceland Mossy Earth’s reforestation efforts are focused on restoring the native woodlands: birchwood forests. As of the publication of this article Mossy Earth has planted over 60000 trees with plans to continue scaling the project during the 2023 planting season. The species they are focusing on planting include native birch rowan aspen and tea-leaved willow. These stands of forest will provide much needed habitat for a variety of native bird species like redpoll snipe ptarmigan and redwing. Not to mention these woodlands will provide the much needed windbreaks and erosion control necessary to start restoring Iceland’s soils.

Mossy Earth: Taking a different approach to conservation

Let’s take a step back though to talk about the awesome organization behind this reforesting project: Mossy Earth. Since 2017 they have been on a mission to restore wilderness and fight climate change through rewilding reforestation and supporting underfunded ecosystems and species.

From planting trees in Iceland to creating kelp forests in Portugal monitoring Otter Populations in California to saving Slovakia’s Ground Squirrels they are involved in a remarkable number of projects around the world. The best part is that they make it incredibly easy to be a part of all of these projects! For as little as $6.75 a month you can sign up for a Mossy Earth membership that allows you to contribute to their work and track your impact. To learn more about membership you can visit their website to learn about how they measure their impact and their commitment to transparency with your contribution. (And if you have a nature lover in your life you can even gift a membership!)

Reforesting in action!

In order to get a better understanding of the scale and story behind the Reforesting Iceland project Mossy Earth has created an amazing video detailing the history of the project their vision for the future and a story that led them to changing their plans after making frontpage news! Give it a watch.

If you want to learn more about the projects Mossy Earth is working on I highly recommend you go check out their YouTube channel to watch some of their videos. They are informative beautiful and really make you feel like there is a lot of hope for the future if we invest in conservation efforts like the ones they are championing.

Fighting to Protect Even the Smallest Ecosystems

From wetlands to windswept mountains life has found a way to survive in even the most unique places. While our attention is usually drawn to the places with animals that capture our imagination habitats everywhere are in need of our protection. Perhaps we won’t get people to fall in love with a rare species of vole the way we can get them to fall in love with the world’s big cats but the ecosystems they are an emblem of are both worthy of our attention and protection.

This is in part why I love the work of Mossy Earth. They are shining a light on some of the less known less talked about habitats that need our protection. In documenting their work through the videos they share on their YouTube channel they make their work even more accessible bringing concepts like reforesting and rewilding to new people around the world.

To stay up to date with Mossy Earth’s latest projects make sure you follow them on YouTube Instagram or LinkedIn. Or you can sign up for their monthly newsletter on their website.

ORANGE Texas — It was show time in Orange Tx when the Little Cypress-Mauriceville Bears hosted their 4th annual International Paper Classic. This year it attracted the Southern Peninsula Sharks straight out of Australia.

""We'll play a number of games and tournaments"" Sharks coach Ben White said. ""Here is one of the tournaments we heard about that was gonna be really strong competition and it has been so far.""

The Sharks were in Texas for two weeks competing in tournaments to gain exposure and experience against some Lone Star talent.

""We have a couple boys that want to pursue college scholarships over here and come back here one day and then others that want to pursue pathways back at home"" said Coach White. ""Just get experience overseas playing different players and getting exposure.""

""Just like the experience in general"" 17-year-old Corey Hastings said. ""I think I want to come back for college but at the moment seeing these towns is such a unique experience and being here with these guys as well it's super special to share with them.""

The team says the biggest in-game differences between here and Australia are the shot clock and the strength and agility that southeast Texas players possess.

""They play very slow and passive where we play fast and quick so in Australia we have a shot clock for all the games here they can dribble out the ball for a while"" 17-year-old Riley Dunn said. ""It's good to play against different styles.""

""In terms of the stadium and stuff it's pretty similar but the style of basketball is pretty different"" Hastings said. ""We play a lot quicker back home I'm Australia. It's pretty slow here and a lot more methodical and the guys over here are definitely a lot stronger and quicker so it's definitely different playing here compared to back home.""

Even though the Sharks came to compete against the home team they still were greeted with southern hospitality

""Just meeting all the new people"" Dunn said. ""They're good fun.""

""The people seem really cool as well like initially we came in everyone was super nice super open it was really cool to see"" Hastings said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHltZW1waGlhbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8zMzIxMS9tZW1waGlzLWJhc2VkLXB1YmxpYy1jb21wYW5pZXMtcHJlZGljdGlvbnMtZm9yLTIwMjPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,What Memphis-based public companies predict for 2023 - Memphis Local Sports Business & Food News,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vZGFpbHltZW1waGlhbi5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZS8zMzIxMS9tZW1waGlzLWJhc2VkLXB1YmxpYy1jb21wYW5pZXMtcHJlZGljdGlvbnMtZm9yLTIwMjPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E5744F70>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

However that was only the beginning.

Spanning nearly 300 acres Hollywood Park is the largest urban mixed-use development under construction in the Western United States. Developer and Rams owner Stan Kroenke’s vision for the site when completed will offer new apartment residences public parks a lake and entertainment venues anchored by a retail district and surrounded by creative office space. The long-term final buildout of Hollywood Park will include 2500 homes 900000 square feet of office space 890000 square feet of retail and a 300-key hotel. The complex has 25 acres of open space featuring a six-acre artificial lake fronting SoFi Stadium.

“We have about 15 million square feet of entitlements” said Jason Gannon managing director of SoFi Stadium and Hollywood Park. “We’re in our phase one for the project which is about 5 million square feet whenever you include SoFi Stadium YouTube Theater American Airlines Plaza the NFL Media first phase of residential and retail as well.”

The mixed-use development which billions of dollars is being spent on is all linked by walkable paseos and plazas and centered on SoFi Stadium.

There are components of the project that have already come online such as SoFi Stadium which at 3.1 million square feet and the ability to accommodate 100000 fans is the largest stadium in the National Football League. YouTube Theater a 227000-square-foot live entertainment venue meanwhile opened in August 2021. NFL is also betting on the project and in 2021 relocated from Culver City to 214063 square feet within a 450000-square-foot class A office building at Hollywood Park. There is an additional 74922 square feet of studio and creative space devoted to the brand’s growing digital and programming departments.

“Within five miles of our site there’s some 900000 to 1 million people all of whom constitute a market that anywhere else would be a whole city and yet has been traditionally underserved” said Christopher Meany partner at Wilson Meany Hollywood Park’s development manager. “The real superpower of the place is the incredible cosmopolitan community that surrounds it. This is the one part of L.A. that didn’t have that social retail heart. Our project is actually about creating that.”

Residences ready

The first two apartment buildings totaling 314 units will start leasing this month. The site is entitled for up to 2500 residences.

The Residences at Hollywood Park consisting of the Crosby and the Wesley is walkable to shopping dining sports and entertainment venues and public parks within the Hollywood Park complex. The residences were designed by prominent architects Hart Howerton and TCA Architects and interior design firms Kenneth Brown Design and Redmond Aldrich Design. The Crosby with 213 units and the Wesley with 101 units will offer a collection of residences from studios to three-bedroom units ranging 700 to 1450 square feet.

“The buildings have different personalities” Janice Thacher retail and residential partner at Wilson Meany said. “The Wesley is the smaller of the two buildings. It has a cozier feel. The Crosby has a nice pool deck. Both buildings are focused on indoor/outdoor living. A lot of outdoor space roof decks terraces highly amenitized.”

Meany said that both were “nearing completion.” He did not disclose how much apartments at the Crosby and Wesley would rent for but said they would be leased at market rate. According to Rent Café the average rent in Inglewood is $2254 at an average apartment size of 772 square feet.

The Crosby’s and Wesley’s combined 314 units remain a long way off from the 2500 homes entitled at Hollywood Park.

“We’ll build out as the market demands” Thacher said. “Just depending on the pace of the leasing we’ll start focusing on future phases of residential development.”

“We are continually evaluating the residential inventory based on demand” Gannon added. “Trying to balance the amount of construction activity at the site we think it’s important to finish up our first phase of residential and get the residents here at the site and then turn to additional residential down the road.”

Retail on its way

The other element coming online soon at Hollywood Park is the retail component. The first phase of Hollywood Park’s retail district will total 500000 square feet with 320000 square feet currently under construction and scheduled to open this summer. Hollywood Park’s tenants will include South L.A.’s Peace Love Reedburg; a new location for Mid-Wilshire’s Sky’s Gourmet Tacos; a second location for family-owned Inglewood-based juice bar Antojitos Martin; a second Inglewood location for Residency Art Gallery; Three Weavers GRDN the latest venture from Lynne Weaver founder of Inglewood’s Three Weavers Brewing Co.; Cinépolis a dine-in IMAX theatre; and the first public venue of Cosm an experiential media and immersive technology company.

BCV Architecture & Interiors Architects Orange and landscape architect Studio-MLA worked on the retail design.

Meany considers the area “a retail district that will really serve as a gathering point and a regional hub for quite a wide area around us. It’s going to serve as both a neighborhood heart and the center of a region.”

Office availability

CBRE Group Inc. Executive Vice President Rob Waller and his team led by Todd Doney Bob Healey and Patrick Amos are marketing the remaining space at the NFL Media building. Of the 500000-square-foot building the top three floors are available totaling 165000 square feet.

“We are in discussions with tenants who would take the balance of the remaining space” Waller said. “It’s very exciting and I think it’s going to be great for the overall project.”

Waller said the type of tenants who have shown interest are media technology and entertainment companies.

Hollywood Park aspires to become top-of-mind for renters.

“We really feel like we’re creating a new submarket in some ways having the retail the residential the hotel the office the stadium and having all that together combined with the open areas and the walking paths it creates a tremendously unique environment for tenants” Waller said.

Waller said he enjoyed taking part in the marketing of Hollywood Park.

“It’s tremendously exciting” Waller said. “I think this is transformative for the Los Angeles area. It’s the largest mixed-use urban project in the western United States. There aren’t that many opportunities to create brand new submarkets where you have all of these things that are custom designed and purpose built and can be built in a thoughtful way that will meet the desires of the tenants of the future.”

The Inglewood impact

The project’s impact is expected to expand beyond its property line.

“The stadium project does two things. It brings people for events. But the surrounding it’s bringing permanent jobs it brings in tax revenue for the city and it brings in housing. It’s using the space very effectively” John Loper associate professor of real estate at the USC Price School of Public Policy said.

In a city like Inglewood which historically has not had a lot of big retail development it’s bringing in new opportunities.

“From a tax basis it’s going to be good for the city but also for spurring new businesses” Loper said.

Inglewood Mayor James Butts noted that the Hollywood Park complex has already become a great economic boost for the city of Inglewood.

In 2011 nine months after Butts was elected mayor Inglewood was struggling.

“It had a 7.5% unemployment rate” Butts said. “We were going to drain our reserve funds because we were upside down in our general fund by September of 2011.”

Everything has turned around with the incoming sports venues. Last year the Hollywood Park complex brought $18 to $20 million to the city in tax revenue and thousands of jobs.

“What this project has done along with the Forum it’s produced sales tax parking tax and an increase in property tax revenue for the city” Butts said. “The construction phases of both projects had 35% local hire goals built into the agreement. The SoFi project alone had 3200 people a day come to work there 35% of them were Inglewood residents. Pre-pandemic it dropped our unemployment to 4.7%. We went from probably the highest in the state to one of the lowest unemployment rates for a minority-majority city in the country.”

SoFi Stadium has created 30000 jobs in the various phases of construction and before Hollywood Park is completed it will create 50000 to 60000 jobs over its build out Butts said.

“One of the things that’s been very important to us whether it’s during the construction phase or during the operation of Hollywood Park as a whole is to have a positive local impact on the community” Gannon said. “You look at it in terms of sales tax that’s being generated but also the job creation and economic development. We had over $750 million worth of contracts that were awarded to local minority business owners. We have over $120 million of contracts awarded to local Inglewood businesses during the construction of SoFi Stadium. Those numbers have continued to increase as we brought on board our residential and retail contractors. That’s not only during the construction phase but also the operation of the stadium and Hollywood Park.”

Businesses quintupled

While some believe that having a sports entertainment center is detrimental to small businesses “we found the opposite to be true” Butts said. “Our request for business license permits for small businesses have quintupled over the last three years. Our sales taxes have grown enormously including the portion associated with small businesses.”

Butts noted the ripple effect of companies and organizations setting up shop in Inglewood.

“Because we have that stadium we attracted the attention of the L.A. Philharmonic” Butts said. “The Girl Scouts of Greater Los Angeles — 35000 strong — they left Marina del Rey to come here. The NFL Network left Culver City to build a 455000-square-foot building here. YouTube came here and partnered and opened the YouTube Theater. Showtime leased 110000 square feet in the north end of the city. Nike and Dwight Howard have invested in our parks. The Dodgers Field of Dreams program which is going to renovate 75 baseball fields in the county five of those renovations will occur in Inglewood. Two of them have been done already.”

The city of Ingelwood did not pay any incentives to the developer of Hollywood Park. All of the capital was raised by Kroenke and his group.

“The only thing we will pay for and we haven’t paid yet are legitimate city costs but we didn’t pay any of the development costs” Butts said.

Butts does not see any issue with traffic produced by those attending events at the 70000-seat SoFi Stadium the 17505-seat Kia Forum and the upcoming Intuit Dome which will have 18000 seats.

Gannon considers competition from neighboring stadiums as a positive.

“Anytime you bring these types of venues with the events they have whether it’s the Forum to the north or the Clippers at the new Intuit Dome to the south that opportunity to increase traffic at Hollywood Park for our retailers” Gannon said.

Butts said systems will soon be in place to alleviate traffic. “We have an intelligent traffic system now it’s called the ITS it was funded by the project and Los Angeles World Airports (the city department that owns and operates Los Angeles International) to coordinate our signals with Los Angeles along Century Boulevard and Manchester (Boulevard). So we have more technological resources than we did before.”

Moving people

There is also the upcoming People Mover project.

“We’re also putting together the money for $1.4 billion transit connector to connect the T Line station at Florence and Market Street to travel above Market Street above Manchester above Prairie (Avenue) with stops for the venues” Butts said. “It would move about 12000 people an hour and have a dramatic impact on traffic because what it would do it would change the concept of the Metro lines from an esoteric thing that’s nice for people who don’t have cars to a must-have for people who want to get to this entertainment district.”

Butts outlined the possibilities once the People Mover comes together.

“You could fly straight into LAX get on the People Mover have it take you to the K line take it to the Inglewood transit connector go to see your game get back on the transit connector go back to the airport” Butts said.

The goal is to complete the People Mover project by 2026 or 2027 in time for the 2028 Olympics which will hold its opening and closing ceremonies at SoFi Stadium. SoFi Stadium hosted Super Bowl LVI last year. Inglewood also has Wrestlemania and NCAA football coming to the city this year the Clippers next year and the World Cup in 2026.

“There’s only three cities in the history of this country that have had so many events and so many sports teams and that’s San Francisco New York and Los Angeles” Butts said. “But what we’ve done in seven years took them a generation.”

“The most exciting part for me is just the dynamic of the fluid nature of the project as we’re going from events … to opening up retail spaces and having office users here on site throughout the year” Gannon added. “The Hollywood Park development is the largest urban mixed-use development under construction west of the Mississippi and to be a part of that every day and watch it change every day is exciting.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWF0bGFudGljLmNvbS9pZGVhcy9hcmNoaXZlLzIwMjMvMDEvZmFyb2UtaXNsYW5kcy1kZW5tYXJrLXRheC1zeXN0ZW0tYW1lcmljYS82NzI0MDEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Why Can't America Do Taxes Like the Faroe Islands?,"If one thing unites all Americans it’s the conviction that paying taxes is a pain. Even those like myself who don’t mind contributing their fair share to keep seniors off the street hate having to fill out all of the paperwork especially if our taxes are complicated. The Tax Foundation estimates that filling out tax forms eats up 6.5 billion hours of work a year for an economic cost of something like $313 billion. There’s a better way—but for depressing reasons the United States probably won’t take it.

I recently traveled to the Faroe Islands a small semi-autonomous part of Denmark out in the North Atlantic for a joint reporting project for The American Prospect and the People’s Policy Project. The idea was to investigate the country’s tax authority which is called TAKS. I’d heard it is the cleanest and most efficient in the world.

Even with those expectations what I found impressed me. The Faroes haven’t just set up a centralized system that automatically collects tax revenue and disburses welfare payments; they also continuously monitor all of your labor income and adjust your withholding as necessary if you lose a job or get a new one. Ordinary businesses and employees never have to even think about TAKS—no tax return is required.

From the April 2019 issue: Americans don’t cheat on their taxes

What’s more the system almost automatically produces the best possible economic statistics—virtually an identical and contemporaneous picture of the whole economy down to the last krone—instead of relying on the kinds of laborious and inaccurate surveys used in the U.S. That automation in turn has allowed TAKS to cut its budget and staffing while increasing audits on large rich companies. As an American I was pretty humiliated to see our clock getting not just cleaned but polished to a mirror finish by a tiny archipelago of just 54000 people.

It was also humiliating to acknowledge that the U.S. is unlikely to learn anything from the Faroes let alone copy-paste their TAKS system. Any such effort would have to overcome barriers of corruption and ideological bias.

Before I get to that let me swat down a common reaction that pops up whenever people compare America with the Nordic countries. Those countries are small and supposedly homogeneous the argument goes so we can’t really compare them with a huge country like the U.S. That size point however actually runs in the opposite direction: It is easier not harder for a big wealthy country to set up a streamlined bureaucracy because of efficiencies of scale. A bigger tax database requires less money per person than a smaller one and America has the world’s greatest supply of computer scientists. There’s no technical reason we can’t borrow the Faroese tax system.

On the diversity point racial bias can indeed impede the kind of class solidarity and labor movements that backstop Nordic institutions. But that just means we must battle racism not that we have to give up on economic equality and efficient government. Besides racial animus is not even close to the biggest barrier to tax reform. Franklin Roosevelt’s Democrats raised the top marginal tax rate to 94 percent in a country that was dramatically more racist than it is today.

Vested interests and ideology are the real obstacles to fixing the IRS. Numerous attempts to streamline the American tax system have run into a wall of money from the tax-prep industry. As Justin Elliott and Paul Kiel reported for ProPublica in 2019 for more than two decades these companies led by Intuit and H&R Block have aggressively mobilized to stave off attempts to create a government system for free tax filing online. They swatted down an attempt from the George W. Bush administration to move in this direction and also blocked the Obama administration from pushing the idea.

In California a Stanford professor named Joseph Bankman (amusingly the father of the disgraced crypto kingpin Sam Bankman-Fried) set up a “ReadyReturn” system that would have automated most state filing; according to him he spent $30000 out of his own pocket lobbying to make it permanent. Intuit spent far more lobbying state legislators and blocked the system by one vote.

The end result of these lobbying battles was a supposed compromise where private firms would offer free tax filing for anyone making less than $73000 and the IRS would in return not set up its own system. But by employing a lot of deceptive language and advertising trickery the companies ensured that almost nobody took advantage of the free service.

Read: The time tax

Intuit added code to their website to hide their free product from Google searches instead pushing consumers toward a “Free Edition” product that had lots of traps requiring payment. This worked like a charm—less than 3 percent of tax returns were submitted through the free-file service as of 2019. (That year the IRS disallowed the search blocking and some other tricks; it also rescinded its promise to never build a competing free-file system.)

Worse one of the most profitable demographics for Intuit and its ilk is Earned Income Tax Credit recipients who may lack the education or time to file their own taxes. Tax-prep fees eat up roughly 13 to 22 percent of the benefit dollars intended to help the working poor.

In a staggering example of economic parasitism these companies trick people into paying for a service that a civilized government should provide for free and then take that money and block any proposals to set up a free service.

That brings me to ideology. Almost as remarkable as TAKS itself is the fact that the Faroese tax code has no income-tax deductions of any kind. This greatly enables the automation of the system because all of the calculations are much simpler.

This is frankly impossible to imagine in the U.S. even if we were to replace the numerous tax-code handouts (165 of them at the Treasury Department’s last count although that also includes business benefits) with direct payments. It would require a bone-deep acceptance of taxation that is directly at odds with centuries of American history. We are raised on “the idea that wealth is privately produced and then appropriated by a quasi-illegitimate state through taxation” as the economist Yanis Varoufakis writes. Tax deductions encourage the recipients of government largesse to believe that they are rugged individualists clawing more of their own money back.

By the same token hatred of taxation is a central pillar of the American conservative movement. Intuit has a major ally in the anti-tax activist Grover Norquist who has lobbied for years to make filing taxes as annoying and burdensome as possible in order to build support for cutting rates.

On a more positive note both H&R Block and Intuit recently pulled out of the free-file program breaking the compromise and freeing the IRS to act. And fortuitously the IRS has received an infusion of $80 billion to upgrade and modernize its systems. Some kind of government-run free-filing system or partial tax automation may arise in the coming years. But realistically Americans aren’t going to follow the example of the Faroes and make taxes something the majority of people never even have to think about.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMia2h0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2Jsb2dzL3ZvaWNlcy90ZWNobm9sb2d5LXRyZW5kcy1hbnRpY2lwYXRlZC10by1iZS1nYW1lLWNoYW5nZXJzLWluLTIwMjMv0gFraHR0cHM6Ly90aW1lc29maW5kaWEuaW5kaWF0aW1lcy5jb20vYmxvZ3Mvdm9pY2VzL3RlY2hub2xvZ3ktdHJlbmRzLWFudGljaXBhdGVkLXRvLWJlLWdhbWUtY2hhbmdlcnMtaW4tMjAyMy8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Technology trends anticipated to be game-changers in 2023,"For decades technology has propelled the global economy. Nations are using technology in meaningful ways to develop sectors and create future cities. Now India is considered a knowledge powerhouse and has become the centre of global attraction. The exponential growth of technology has powered the nation’s economic growth too.

While there’s a lot of innovation going on in India—and the rest of the world—some technologies are anticipated to be game-changers in 2023.

Waking up to artificial intelligence

Artificial intelligence is playing a prominent role in the fintech sector. Financial companies and banks have accelerated the adoption of artificial intelligence experiencing improved productivity increased profits and exceptional customer service.

We expect generative artificial intelligence to become more powerful than ever. It has the potential to create personalized conversational systems for customers across industries. It also provides human experts the necessary financial insights that can help customers in more ways than one. Small businesses will be able to thrive on generative artificial intelligence to engage with customers and solve problems at great speed.

Web 3.0 will create a more interconnected world

Being the third iteration of the Internet Web 3.0 is touted to cause massive changes to the fintech world. Web3 interconnects data in a decentralized way for personalized and delightful user experiences. Technologies such as blockchain cryptocurrencies non-fungible tokens and decentralized autonomous organizations help to advance the digital landscape and implement digital democracies.

Web 3 will provide more control for users by giving ownership of data back through decentralization. As a result building new web protocols and infrastructure allow developers to build apps with user control data. In 2023 we can expect companies to lay the groundwork to make Web 3 a reality.

Metaverse will make sci-fi a reality

Metaverse is an interactive virtual platform that is massively scaled—bringing some of our sci-fi dreams to life. The technology need not be limited to one platform and it can create shared experiences. In such a deeply rich immersive world artificial intelligence will be called upon to understand words images videos and texts regardless of the users’ language. And there will be massive opportunities for businesses in the metaverse and how they interact with their customers.

While the world is still at the early stage of metaverse—there is so much to look forward to especially in the ecommerce gaming and entertainment industries.

Quantum computing is on the rise

Global companies are heading fast toward quantum computing because there is intensity and innovation in this space. Quantum computers are much more powerful in certain tasks such as investigating novel batter designs or discoveries of new drugs.

There is another trend worth noticing about which is quantum computing transforming cybersecurity. In the past few years researchers have been working hard to develop quantum-safe encryption. One of the quantum computing predictions has become important to cryptography too.

Despite all this—and despite everything discussed about rising technologies through the decades—the most important thing to keep in mind is the learnings. Companies around the world are exploring new opportunities and challenges along the way—especially with disruptive technologies.

Data security will be a top priority

While technology makes transformative changes data privacy and security will become even more imperative. According to Gartner 65 percent of the world population will have personalized data covered under modern privacy regulations in 2023. The stats imply that data security is top of mind for companies and it will grow exponentially in the coming years.

As data privacy laws take effect globally governments and companies are taking appropriate steps to protect their data. These efforts will be critical because data will be analyzed and shared continuously giving rise to new opportunities for privacy-enhancing technologies. New methods of having cryptography on data sets and transforming information will increase collaboration analysis and protective data sharing.

The Los Angeles Rams owner and leading investor of Hollywood Park in Inglewood which includes SoFi Stadium closed on his purchase of The Village. The acquisition adds to his portfolio a developed shopping center adjoining two square blocks of Woodland Hills properties he purchased last year. The transaction further fuels speculation that Kroenke will add a Rams team facility to the area.

Kroenke through The Kroenke Organization bought The Village from French retail developer Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield which announced the transaction on Dec. 27 for a $325 million price tag.

In March Kroenke also acquired the Westfield Promenade mall site just south of The Village from Unibail for $150 million and in June purchased the adjacent office building at 21555 Oxnard St. for $175 million.

The Westfield Topanga center was not part of the transaction although Unibail has spent much of this year offloading its U.S. properties and may continue to do so this year.

“This transaction is another step in the streamlining of our U.S. regional asset portfolio as part of our wider plan to radically reduce our financial exposure to the U.S. and demonstrates the continued investor interest in high quality assets with strong operating performance” Unibail Chief Financial Officer Fabrice Mouchel said in a statement.

A Kroenke representative said the purchase “furthers Stan Kroenke’s investment in Warner Center the Woodland Hills community and the greater Los Angeles region at-large. We will continue to operate The Village as an open-air lifestyle and retail destination.”

Rams facility planned?

Last year speculation began that Kroenke who famously keeps plans close to the chest was planning to relocate the Rams’ headquarters and practice facility to the Warner Center from Agoura Hills and Thousand Oaks respectively.

The Promenade which only has a handful of operating businesses and the office building property next door have a combined nearly 65 acres. Prior to selling the Promenade Unibail had secured environmental reviews and permits for redevelopment plans there — including a 10000-15000-seat sports arena.

The Village which opened in 2015 is a thriving 600000-square-foot outdoor retail center whose continued operation would certainly fit into the broader dreams for the area.

The city-approved Warner Center 2035 Specific Plan seeks to essentially transform the area into the San Fernando Valley’s downtown. Development particularly of apartment buildings has taken off.

Brad Rosenheim executive director of the Warner Center Association has welcomed Kroenke’s interest in the area.

“Everybody is speculating because no one has seen anything” he said “but I think if the Rams move their headquarters and practice facility here it would be a fantastic addition. I think Mr. Kroenke has proven he can create wonderful places and that would only add to the upward trajectory of the Warner Center community.”

Area development

Though the Warner Center area of Woodland Hills has long been designated for upward development it was unclear who would make the first moves. Unibail after sinking in the time and money to secure permits for what would have been a $1.5 billion overhaul of the Promenade announced its retreat from the U.S. market last year.

Kroenke’s recently acquired office building which previously housed Anthem Inc. has been vacant since 2019.

John Walker president of the Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization previously told the Business Journal that his group had met with Kroenke’s following the Promenade acquisition and that’s where he first got wind that Kroenke’s people were considering practice fields for the previously planned stadium as they pondered what to do with the land. He said at the time he hoped to work with Kroenke’s development team to alleviate whatever traffic and noise issues would arise from development.

“We worked very hard with Westfield when they developed their Promenade project” Walker said in June. “When there are opportunities like this there’s always room for a negative impact and we’re going to work with them to see that the negative impact is minimized or eliminated.”

Should this all manifest it wouldn’t be Kroenke’s first transformation in Los Angeles. SoFi Stadium which is owned by Kroenke and another joint venture became the landmark structure of the master-planned Hollywood Park neighborhood in Inglewood.

Spanning nearly 300 acres Hollywood Park is the largest urban mixed-use development under construction in the Western United States. When completed it will have new apartment residences public parks a lake and entertainment venues anchored by a retail district and creative office space. The long-term final buildout of Hollywood Park will include 2500 homes 900000 square feet of office space 890000 square feet of retail and a 300-room hotel. The complex has 25 acres of open space featuring a six-acre artificial lake fronting SoFi Stadium.

Other amenities in that area include the Forum and the under-construction Intuit Dome that will host the L.A. Clippers.

In Woodland Hills Rosenheim figured a sports facility wouldn’t be the only thing on Kroenke’s docket.

“I think it would be a great economic boost for the area and our plans for the future of being a transportation-technology zone” he said. “Given all the land purchased I think this will be much more than a Rams practice facility.”

Sky News understands that the senior lenders which include prominent City names such as Invesco and Man GLG could strike a deal within the next fortnight.

Under a proposal submitted by the syndicate the funds would inject close to £100m of new funding into Matalan in order to secure its short-term future.

Sources close to the process said the lenders were in talks with Nigel Oddy the chain's interim chief executive about the possibility of making the role permanent if they succeed in gaining control of it.

The group of first-lien lenders have been vying to buy Matalan with rival bidders including its founder John Hargreaves who is being backed by the feared American investor Elliott Advisers.

Three days before Christmas Matalan issued an update on the sale process which confirmed it had received bids from several parties.

""The company is currently assessing all the bids and constructive discussions are continuing with interested parties and their advisers"" it said.

""In addition the ad hoc group of existing First Lien Noteholders represented by Invesco Man GLG Napier Park and Tresidor which now holds over 70% of the First Lien Secured Notes has reconfirmed its commitment to a recapitalisation if necessary.

It added that it was aiming to complete a transaction before the end of January.

""All transactions under consideration provide for a material reduction of Matalan's debt including the First Lien Secured debt an extended debt maturity profile and any new funding that may be required"" it said on December 22.

""The stable and sustainable balance sheet will put the company in a position of financial strength allowing it to execute on its business plan and deliver its growth strategy.""

Matalan which was founded by Mr Hargreaves in 1985 faces an imminent deadline to refinance £350m in debt.

It recently also took a £60m loan from Bantry Bay - in which Elliott owns a stake - as it sought to strengthen its balance sheet ahead of what threatens to be a prolonged slump in consumer sentiment.

Based in Liverpool Matalan employs more than 11000 people and trades from 230 UK stores.

It also operates an e-commerce platform and has more than 50 overseas franchise stores.

The company claims to have 11m customers.

It remains unclear what valuation any sale process may achieve given the state of Britain's retail sector.

Like many of its peers Matalan found its finances severely strained by the pandemic prompting the Monaco-based Mr Hargreaves to provide substantial financial support.

In recent months global inflationary pressures have impaired margins while supply chain challenges have had an impact on stock availability.

Matalan warned during the summer that its ""ability to successfully refinance our debts involves geopolitical economic and market factors outside the direct control of the business"".

In the autumn Mr Hargreaves stepped down after a brief return as Matalan's chairman in order to participate in the bidding process.

The chain recently appointed Paul Copley a former restructuring partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers and experienced retail board member as the latest in a string of chairmen.

The Hargreaves family is being advised by Lazard while Teneo is handling the sale and Perella Weinberg Partners is advising the first-lien - or senior - lenders.

Total expenses went up 131 per cent to Rs 9574.5 crore in FY22.

According to its annual financial statement with the Registrar of Companies (RoC) during the last quarter of FY22 Swiggy turned ""decacorn"" (with a valuation of $10 billion and above) after raising a $700 million round led by Invesco.

Meanwhile Swiggy's revenue grew 2.2 times to Rs 5705 crore during FY22 as opposed to Rs 2547 crore in FY21.

According to Entrackr outsourcing support cost accounted for 24.5 per cent of the total expenses of the company.

This particular cost increased 2.3 times to Rs 2350 crore in FY22 from Rs 1031 crore in FY21.

Its advertising and promotional expenses surged 4 times to reach Rs 1848.7 crore during FY22 according to the report.

Reports surfaced last month that Swiggy may lay off more than 250 employees or up to 5 per cent of its workforce starting January.

""There have been no layoffs at Swiggy. We concluded our performance cycle in October and have announced ratings and promotions at all levels. As with every cycle we expect exits based on performance"" a Swiggy spokesperson had said in a statement.

The upcoming layoffs are likely to impact Swiggy's quick commerce delivery service Instamart to reduce cash burn.

In November global brokerage firm Jefferies said that Swiggy was fast losing market share to its rival Zomato despite offering heavy discounts.

Citing Swiggy investor Prosus' financial report Jefferies said that the gross value of Swiggy's food delivery business was $1.3 billion in the January-June period this year.

Zomato in the same period logged gross order volume of $1.6 billion.

In May last year Swiggy acquired Dineout a dining out and restaurant tech platform for an undisclosed sum. According to sources the acquisition size was around $200 million.

Earlier this year the food delivery platform raised $700 million led by Invesco at a $10.7 billion valuation.

Stapleton-Baumgart Obituary 2023,"Dr. Barbara L. Stapleton age 65 of Twin Lakes WI passed away peacefully on Monday January 2 2023. She was born on September 6 1957 in Evanston IL to John and Marilyn Stapleton.

She was a graduate of the University of Illinois in Chicago where she received early admission to their veterinary program after two years. Barbara spent the next six years training to become certified in veterinary dentistry. She then went on to practice at Glen Oak Dog & Cat Hospital in Glenview IL. In 1991 Barbara purchased Barrington Animal Hospital in Barrington IL.; however due to health reasons she sold the practice in August of 2020. It was very important to her that her practice was purchased by a family instead of a corporation.

She was a member of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) the Chicago Veterinary Medical Association (CVMA) the American Veterinary Dental College (AVDC) and a fellow of the Academy of American Veterinary Dentistry.

Barbara is survived by her loving husband William Baumgart whom she married on February 29 1992 in Wilmette IL; and their daughter Sarah (Jonathan) Sparks; her sisters Margaret Ann Felice and Mary Jane (Arthur) Krueger; as well as many loving nieces and nephews.

A second visitation for Barbara will be held on Tuesday January 17 2023 from 1pm until the time of service at 2pm at Davenport Family Funeral Home and Crematory 941 S. Old Rand Road Lake Zurich 60047.

Gretchen Whitmer's second inauguration took place Sunday morning.

The event was family-friendly with winter games hot cocoa snacks ice sculpture carving and more following the swearing-in of Whitmer.

Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson Attorney General Dana Nessel and other government officials elected in the November election were present to take the oath of office as well.

Watch the inauguration:

Read Governor Whitmer’s prepared remarks as provided by her office:

“Hello Michigan! I am honored to be here and excited to get to work.

First I want to acknowledge my family—my daughters Sherry and Sydney my husband Marc my dad Dick Whitmer my sister Liz brother Richard and my step-sons Mason Alex and Winston. I could not do this without their love and support.

I want to thank all the statewide leaders with us today: my partner in governance Lieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist. Our Attorney General Dana Nessel and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. Each has served Michigan admirably over the last 4 years and I am grateful to continue our partnership for the next 4.

A warm welcome to my friends in the Michigan Legislature the 2 new Democratic leaders who have each made history—Speaker of the House Joe Tate and Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks. Also welcome to House Minority Leader Matt Hall and Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt. Let’s work together to move Michigan forward. Also I want to acknowledge my federal partners Senators Stabenow and Peters Congresswomen Stevens and Lawrence and our hardworking congressional delegation.

My fellow Michiganders I am honored that you have put your trust in me to keep serving our beautiful state. I will be a governor for ALL Michiganders and I’ll work with anyone who wants to get things done.

Michigan Executive Office of the Governor

In November Michiganders spoke with a clear voice. They want the ability to raise a family without breaking the bank strong protections for constitutional rights and leaders focused on the fundamental issues that matter most to their lives. They expect us to embody the values they live up to every day—grit and grace. They deserve practical problem solvers who get things done.

Michiganders are smart. We know we face a lot of immediate and long-term challenges. By working together we can tackle those challenges.

Over the next 4 years…

We must do everything we can to lower costs so families have more money in their pockets to pay the bills and put food on the table.

Grow our economy so every person can get the skills to land a good-paying job.

Ensure every Michigander is safe going to work dropping their kids off at school or at home in their neighborhood.

Build up infrastructure for our communities: From the roads people drive on the homes they live in to the pipes that deliver their kids’ drinking water.

Our task is clear: focus on the fundamentals work together and get things done.

So let’s talk about those fundamentals. What are we going to do over the next 4 years? I will have a lot more to say in my upcoming State of the State and budget addresses.

But I want to share the vision with you here today.

Let’s ensure our hardworking seniors can keep more of what they’ve earned.

Let’s bring supply chains home from China to Michigan and become an epicenter of innovation in clean energy batteries and chips.

Let’s empower every child—no matter where they live—to pursue their potential by continuing to make record investments in education from preschool to postsecondary.

Let’s fight for our workers and ensure they can earn a good living and have great benefits including time with their families and quality affordable health care.

Let’s reduce gun violence—the #1 of killer of our kids in this country—by pursuing commonsense reforms.

Let’s repeal outdated laws limiting our freedom to control our own bodies and marry who we want.

Let’s tackle climate change head-on while: creating jobs lowering costs and protecting our air and our lakes both Great and small.

If we reach across the aisle bring people together in every region and focus on solving problems we can make Michigan a place where all people can envision a great future no matter who they are where they come from or how much money they have in their pocket.

We have a lot of good work to do. I am more confident than ever that our future is bright because of you my fellow Michiganders the tough hardworking people who call this place home.

How do you know a Michigander? There are a few telltale signs.

We show off our hometown with pride by pointing to our hands. Or our mittens.

We have the peninsulas or the Great Lakes on our cars around our necks and on our clothes.

We rock Stormy Kromers on our heads and put Carhartt on our backs to keep us warm.

We bleed maize and blue but mostly green and white. At least in this town.

We swear by our favorite local craft beer and know that the Lions are on their way up. Hey… they’ve never lost a Super Bowl.

We know that Michigan is a special place and we want to make it better for Michiganders today and those to come in the decades ahead.

Michigan Executive Office of the Governor



But what makes a Michigander?

It’s not any of those things I just mentioned. It’s our underdog spirit and our championship swagger. We are tough and we never shy away from hard work. Michiganders are competitive. Even if you count us out look down on us or fly over us I promise you: we will defy your expectations.

Over the next 4 years we will dig deep and get things done.

It’s what Michiganders do. We’ve got some famous ones you may know:

A rapper from 8 mile who taught us to lose ourselves in the moment.

Sojourner from Battle Creek born into slavery who fought for liberation and women’s equality. Her last name was her legacy—Truth.

A genre-defining singer from Detroit who told us that we all deserve a little R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

A young man from Saginaw born without sight whose voice lifts our souls.

Another from Iron Mountain who became one of the greatest basketball coaches to ever do it.

And Hemingway one of America’s greatest writers who spent his childhood summers in Petoskey and wrote “the world is a fine place and worth fighting for.”

These are folks you may know. But there are millions you don’t.

Centuries of Anishinaabe who fought to preserve their culture and defend the Great Lakes that define us. Generations of families who migrated here from across the country and around the world to escape poverty and violence or simply seek a better life. They built the middle class and the automobile with their bare hands.

They saw our spectacular peninsulas as places of possibility. They came with nothing looking for something. They worked hard over centuries in hopes that their children and grandchildren would have a brighter future with more freedom and opportunity.

That’s what Michigan is at its best:

A beacon for anyone who has been counted out or left behind.

The embodiment of hope defined by hard work.

Those of us who are lucky enough to be Michiganders know that. It’s why we love our state. For the next 4 years our task is to ensure that every Michigander—present and future—can succeed.

Our message is simple: We’re putting the world on notice that your future is in Michigan.

If you want to have a great quality of life at a good cost of living your future is in Michigan.

If you’ve got big dreams and an underdog spirit your future is in Michigan.

If you want to come together to get things done your future is in Michigan.

I am so excited to get to work. Let’s move Michigan forward! Thank you and happy new year! Drive safe and let’s go Lions.”

""You can't find votes that aren't right wing"" said Hester who was elected by the Senate in November to serve as its leader for the 94th General Assembly from 2023 until 2025.

""I never supported a tax increase. I don't support fee increases"" said the 45-year-old homebuilder and real estate agent who has rental properties.

Hester also called himself ""a free market capitalist borderline Libertarian"" adding he supports the military and opposes legalizing recreational marijuana.

""I feel like the solution to most problems is less government not more"" he said in an interview at his home.

""My Christian faith is what I hope dominates every area of my life"" said Hester who attends First Baptist Church Bentonville.

Hester said his wife Ashley has a tremendous influence on him. Several years ago he built a home for his family in Cave Springs and a home next door for her parents Dale and Beverly Dorsey.

""I share with my colleagues when we are in session and I make a vote that she doesn't agree with she lets me know"" he said. ""Without a doubt she is to the right of me. My colleagues love it when she gets on me about votes.""

For example Hester said his wife has asked him why he voted differently at times than Sen. Breanne Davis R-Russellville and departing state Sen. Bob Ballinger R-Ozark or why Davis voted differently than Ballinger and him.

""I'm like 'Why do I have to defend myself?' "" Hester said. ""I love that even though I am away from home that we are engaged and I care that she cares about what I am doing.""

Ashley Hester said she doesn't question her husband about his votes very often ""but I like to keep him on his toes.

""I like to listen to the guys at The Daily Wire so they are much more aggressive and so I give him a hard time after listening to them and then he has to set me straight"" said Ashley Hester who formerly taught at Providence Classical Christian Academy in Rogers where three of the couple's children attend school for part of the week and are home schooled the rest of the week.

""I usually always agree with him after he explains it to me"" she added.

The Daily Wire is an American conservative news website and media company founded in 2015 by political commentator Ben Shapiro and film director Jeremy Boreing.

As incoming Senate president pro tempore Hester succeeds Sen. Jimmy Hickey R-Texarkana who has been the Senate's leader for the past two years.

He has been in the state Senate since 2013 and was the Senate Republican leader from 2019-2021. The Senate will include 29 Republicans and six Democrats starting in the regular session.

In his first term in the Senate Hester said departing Sen. Cecile Bledsoe R-Rogers suggested he start hanging out with departing Sen. Jim Hendren of Sulphur Springs who has a ""great family"" and is successful in business and politics.

""From that conversation on I really did hitch my wagon to Senator Hendren and learned from him as much as I could"" he said. ""There at the end we took some different paths.""

In February 2021 Hendren announced his departure from the Republican Party to be an independent saying the ""final straw"" was the Jan. 6 riot at the nation's Capitol. He founded the group Common Ground Arkansas with the aim of finding and supporting leaders willing to work together instead of pushing people apart.

Hester said ""I understand why Senator Hendren went the direction he went.

""I just don't agree with it totally"" he said. ""We had two different strategies on how to make the Republican Party work better together.""

Hendren who served as Senate president pro tempore from 2019 until 2021 said Hester will do great as the Senate's leader saying Hester ""has a real ability to build bridges with people who don't see eye to eye with him.

""I have seen him mature so fast in the Legislature"" he said.

Hester has sponsored bills that became Act 137 of 2015 to bar local governments from enacting and enforcing their own anti-discrimination statutes Act 710 of 2017 to prohibit state and local governments from contracting with and investing in companies that boycott Israel Act 643 of 2017 to prevent cities and counties from enacting a minimum wage higher than the state's minimum wage and Act 611 of 2021 to require Holocaust education to be taught in all public schools.

Among other things he's also sponsored bills that became Act 508 of 2017 to allow grocery stores in the state's wet counties to expand their wine sales to include more than just wines from small farms that produce 250000 gallons or less a year and Act 822 of 2019 to require Internet retailers with no in-state physical presence to collect Arkansas' sales and use taxes on purchases phase in a reduction of the state's top corporate income tax rate from 6.5% to 5.9% by Jan. 1 2022 extend the net operating carry-forward period for corporations; and overhaul the taxation of commercial car washes.

""I want to be where the fight is"" Hester said. ""If I am sacrificing time from my family and time from my business I want to be making the maximum impact I can make.""

HESTER AND SANDERS

Departing Senate Democratic leader Keith Ingram of West Memphis said it appears Hester is going to be a close ally of Republican Gov.-elect Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

The Senate traditionally has been a check and balance on the governor he said.

""That changed a bit when Governor [Asa] Hutchinson came in for his first term and then it drifted away pretty dramatically into the Senate reasserting itself"" Ingram said.

""I think the jury is out"" he said of Hester.

Hester said ""I think we will align on almost every issue"" with Sanders.

""That makes it easy in the Senate"" he said.

""I have found that she is very respectful of legislators and their input"" Hester said.

""We are more of the same age"" he said of Sanders who is 40.

""We have kids at home. We deal a lot with the same issues at home so I can identify with her"" he said. ""She went to Ouachita [Baptist University] and was an EEE in the social club. My daughter [Brooklyn Hester] is at Ouachita as an EEE in the social club.""

""I have a tremendous amount of trust in who Governor Sanders is the direction she is going to lead the state and how she is going to conduct herself when she leads us through difficult issues"" Hester said.

He said ""what I think the lessons learned from Governor Hutchinson is we can't be so close that what the governor wants overrides what the Legislature wants.

""We are going to have opinions. I expect those opinions to be heard and to be inputted into the direction we are going"" Hester said.

""I can't imagine that there is anything that Governor Sanders wants that we are not going to try to deliver all the things she has committed to the people"" Hester said. ""But she understands and I understand how important that there are co-equal branches and that the input of the legislators [is] going to be involved in that.""

Sanders said in a written statement ""Senator Hester is a friend who I am excited to work alongside advancing bold reforms to help improve the lives of Arkansans.

""The Senator is a man of faith loves his family and the state of Arkansas all of which is evident in our frequent conversations"" she said.

""He is going to do a great job leading the entire Senate as pro tempore"" said Sanders whose father Mike Huckabee served as a Republican governor from July 1996 until 2007 when Democrats controlled the state House and state Senate.

Hutchinson said he is optimistic about how Hester will fare as Senate president pro tempore.

""I have worked with him and he's grown in his role of leadership and he understands that the pro tempore has to get things done has to manage the Senate so I think he sees a bigger agenda for the state than simply a legislator representing one district"" the governor said.

""I think the big challenge is whether the other members of the Senate will follow his leadership but I will be watching from afar"" Hutchinson said. ""I will be pulling for Sen. Hester.""

Ingram said there is no way to predict the impact of 13 new senators in the 35-member Senate.

Last year Hester won election as the Senate president pro tempore over Hickey after losing a similar bid for the post to Hickey in 2020.

In March 2022 the Senate elected Hester as Senate president pro tempore-designate after Senate Republicans selected Hester as their nominee for the post over Sen. Kim Hammer of Benton and Hickey.

Hester said ""the vote was very close"" in the Senate Republican caucus but he declined to disclose the margin.

In April 2020 the Senate elected Hickey over Hester as the Senate president pro-tempore designate with the apparent backing of a coalition of Senate Republicans and Democrats after the Senate Republicans selected Hester as their nominee without Hickey seeking the GOP nomination.

Hester said ""Senator Hickey called me right after the election [earlier this year] and said that he felt like he didn't receive any support when he won and he said 'I will be as helpful to you as I can' and he has 100% honored that.

""Because of how Hickey has handled this it's reflecting on our whole body so our whole body is getting along well"" he said.

Hickey said Hester is going to do ""fine"" as Senate president pro tempore.

""I am going to do whatever I can to make Senator Hester successful"" he added.

Asked whether the House and Senate education committees' differences over the timing of teacher pay raises could be symptomatic of multiple differences between the House and Senate in the coming session Hester said ""I think a healthy rub between the House and the Senate is by nature so it doesn't bother me that we are going to have some rub with the House.

""If we didn't it wouldn't be healthy"" he said.

Hester said he wants teacher pay raises that the state budget can afford for the next 10 years.

House Speaker Matthew Shepherd R-El Dorado said differences between the House and Senate education committees on the timing of teacher pay raises don't necessarily mean there will be larger disagreements between the House and the Senate.

""In the past we have gotten along well and ultimately on most significant issues we have been able to end up on the same page"" he said referring to Hester.

""My goal is to resolve the issues between the House and Senate and find consensus and do good work for the people of Arkansas"" Shepherd said.

HESTER'S STYLE

Hester acknowledged he's not as detail-oriented as his recent predecessors as Senate president pro tempore.

""I am a macros-perspective [leader]"" he said.

""I care about winning on the issue but how we get there really doesn't bother me at all"" Hester said.

""Early on I felt you had to get 100% of what you wanted or nothing and I have learned that I will take wins"" instead of holding out as ""a hard liner.""

""Every detail isn't critical to me but the reason I feel good about that is I have got some people around me that really care about the details that I have a lot of trust in"" Hester said.

For example he said he trusts that Hickey has looked at all the details when Hickey speaks on lottery and tax policy and he trusts Sen. Jonathan Dismang R-Searcy has looked at all the details when he speaks on the budget and other issues.

""That's how they are wired"" Hester said.

""They care deeply about that. I care more about the involvement of all my colleagues"" Hester said. ""I think that's just a difference in some leadership style but there will be a lot of times here where I will assert myself and this is the direction we are going and work really hard to get us there"" Hester said.

""I am a home builder"" Hester said ""I am not a CPA budget guy so if we want to talk about how to frame a house or pour the slab I care about the details. I understand them.""

He has been outspoken at times throughout his tenure in the Senate.

Asked whether he shoots from the hip at times in his remarks he said ""early on I might have shot from the hip but when I say something now I have thought through it and I understand the consequences of it.""

Hester said he doesn't make a move without consulting several senators such as Terry Rice R-Waldron and Davis Dismang and Hickey.

Dismang said Hester ""is an open book.""

""If he feels a particular way you are going to know and if he still feels strongly about something he is going to state it"" he said. ""He doesn't hold back on a whole lot.""

Hester said he is passionate about criminal justice issues in part because ""when I was a young man my uncle was murdered by a guy that was on parole for murder.

""Just the injustice of that I didn't understand it when I was a young man. I don't understand it today"" he said. ""When you choose to harm somebody you have chosen that and I have very little empathy for people that have committed violent crimes and sexual assault.""

HESTER BACKGROUND

Hester was born in Conway as the youngest of four children and grew up in Bee Branch until third grade when his family moved to Green Forest. His parents Russell and Joyce Hester worked in the public schools. His father was inducted into the Southern Arkansas University Sports Hall of Fame in 2009 for his pitching in 1974 and 1975.

He graduated from Green Forest High School in 1996 where he was the quarterback on the football team the catcher on the baseball team the point guard on the basketball team and ran long distance on the track team.

As a walk-on Hester said he didn't make the baseball team at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville but accepted an offer to be a practicing manager and got to practice for a year.

Then Coach Norm DeBriyn put Hester on the roster for next three years. Hester said he suited up for games and was on the traveling squad and was the bullpen catcher and would throw batting practice.

""But I got to wear the Hog uniform every day and I got the SEC championship ring [in 1999]"" Hester said.

He earned his bachelor's degree in general business from the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville in 2001 -- the year he married his wife who earned a bachelor's degree in English and spent four years on the pom squad at the university.

Hester said he sold concrete for Central Ready Mix owned by businessmen J.B. Hunt and Tim Graham for handful of years until they sold the company and then he was a property manager for Hunt and Graham for a handful of years.

""We would sit in meetings with politicians"" he said where he saw the impact of their policies on entrepreneurs.

Hester said Crossland Construction was one of his biggest customers when he was selling concrete and Crossland Construction was one of his biggest contractors for the Hunt family when he was a property manager. Hester said Chris Curt Ivan and Benny Crossland indicated they would help him raise money for a bid for the state Senate in 2012.

In the 2012 primary Hester defeated then-state Rep. Tim Summers R-Bentonville.

""I committed not to raise taxes and stayed focused on the issues that matter in a Republican primary"" Hester said.

Hester is viewed in Republican circles as a potential candidate for Arkansas' 3rd district congressional seat or a U.S. Senate seat.

""The more I have been around the more I see the cost to your family to be gone a lot"" Hester said.

Hester said Arkansas has ""some of the best U.S. Senators in the country"" in John Boozman of Rogers and Tom Cotton of Little Rock and he's ""very pleased"" with U.S. Rep. Steve Womack of Rogers.

""I am home right now raising my kids. I love doing that"" he said. ""Later on if my kids get grown and Congressman Womack or a senator [doesn't seek re-election] I think I would look at the opportunity at that time.""

There would be many potential highly qualified and great candidates for an open seat Hester said ""so we would just look at that at the time.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

Va. after escaping from Columbus hospital,"State troopers in West Virginia on Sunday night arrested a fugitive wanted in a shootout with police in Bucyrus Ohio who had escaped from a Columbus mental health hospital last week.

Jacob Davidson 38 escaped from Twin Valley Behavioral Health Hospital on Columbus' West Side on Thursday according to the Ohio State Highway Patrol which holds jurisdiction over Twin Valley. The highway patrol told WBNS-10TV that Davidson exited through a window.

He was re-arrested on Sunday at around 10:30 p.m. in Chapmanville West Virginia and is being held in the state's Southwestern Regional Jail awaiting extradition to Ohio according to the West Virginia State Troopers’ office.

Davidson had earlier been arrested on Nov. 11 after Crawford County and Morrow County sheriff’s offices responded to shooting incidents in which one person was injured according to a sheriff's office news release. Officers pursued Davidson in a vehicle chase and exchange gunfire with him before arresting him.

Davidson was indicted by a grand jury on Nov. 15 on charges of felonious assault a first-degree felony; disrupting public services a fourth-degree felony; improperly handling firearms in a motor vehicle a fourth-degree felony; and discharging a firearm on or near prohibited premises a third-degree felony according to records from the Crawford County Common Pleas Court clerk's website.

Davidson had been transferred from the Crawford County Jail to Twin Valley in Columbus on Dec. 20.

The 39-year-old has even become a beloved face on NBC's Today Show as a fill-in host.

But Jacob also has a fulfilling home life.

The Los Angeles native married his wife Nicole Cari back in 2012.

She is a fashion executive who works as VP of Marketing & Communications at Band of Outsiders.

The pair live in LA together with their two children two-year-old daughter Lucia Ray and son Noah seven.

Jacob is a proud husband and an active dad who loves sharing what he and his brood get up to on social media.

LIFE’S A BEACH

One of the family’s favorite activities is going to the beach.

Like a true Californian Jacob is a passionate surfer and he has said there is “nothing better” than teaching his son how to ride the waves.

Over the summer the dad-of-two shared numerous photos of his family’s beach trips.

One snap showed him with wet hair as he held Lucia on his shoulder with Nicole peering up for the shot.

In the background fans could see the beautiful sunset over the rocks and waves.

“Happy weekend” Jacob wrote in the caption.

THE BLUE CREW

Noah is not only the Today star’s son but also seemingly his best friend.

One of their favorite activities is to go and watch the Los Angeles Dodgers play.

The broadcaster previously shared a photo of himself and Noah in their seats as he claimed the top deck at Dodger Stadium is “as close to Heaven as humans can get.”

Another cute snap showed them wearing matching Dodgers caps as they prepared to cheer on the boys in blue.

Although they weren’t able to watch their team during the pandemic shutdown Jacob told fans “it’s like we never left” when he and Noah returned to the stadium in June 2021.

But baseball is not the only form of of entertainment the family enjoys watching.

This year Jacob and Nicole took Noah to his first ever concert.

The Soboroffs went to see Harry Styles at the Kia Forum in Los Angeles.

Unfortunately Noah did not make it through the late night and Jacob posted a photo of him asleep in his seat.

LOOKALIKE DAUGHTER

Jacob also loves spending quality time with his daughter Lucia.

In May he shared a series of photos after they enjoyed playing with face stickers.

“First face bedazzlement for us both. Looking forward to next time” he wrote in the caption.

Fans in the comments gushed over the “adorable” photos and pointed out how the little one “looks just like her dad”.

MAMA-MIA!

Jacob and Nicole definitely enjoy having fun as parents and this halloween the family-of-four dressed up as Super Mario characters.

While the dad wore a Bowser mask on his head Nicole went with a full-on Princess Peach look including a blonde wig and a crown.

That left the leading role of Mario for Noah and his sidekick Luigi for Lucia.

Fans were in love with the bold matching costumes with some even asking Jacob “adopt me” in the comments.

‘FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART’

As a devoted husband Jacob frequently pays tribute to his beloved wife on social media.

This year the pair celebrated their tenth wedding anniversary with a trip to Europe.

Jacob shared a photo of them locking lips during an evening stroll by a river.

In the caption he gushed: “I would like to thank Nicole from the bottom of my heart on the occasion of our tenth wedding anniversary for allowing me to take so many selfies on this trip.”

Numerous other photos showed the pair in various stunning locations across Europe.

In one steamy snap Jacob went topless on a boat while his glamorous wife showed off her curves in a white swimsuit.

In another post from Tuscany Italy Jacob got suited and booted while his wife wore a long navy blue dress.

“Beautiful wife. Wonderful time” he wrote in the caption.

Fans in the comments shared their love for the “handsome couple”."

Here is the full transcript of the interview lightly edited for clarity:

Q: I’ll start with something simple. What is your administration’s top accomplishment that you are most proud of in the past year? And what area do you think you could improve the most on?

A: Yeah so first of all thank you for taking time. We have the largest bond deal in the history of the city of Chicago $1.25 billion bond deal. We’re gonna build homes and create real economic development for people. It’s unprecedented investment. That’s what I promised I would do when I became mayor and we’ve done that.

A quarter of a billion dollars to address the unhoused crisis in this city; $100 million for violence prevention. We’re going to open up two mental health clinics this year. This is the result of course from two administrations ago shutting down mental health clinics. We abolished the subminimum wage in the city of Chicago. Black and brown women 100000 workers are going to get a raise. We have the most substantive paid time off in any major city in this country 1.3 million workers have additional days that they will be able to take off as a result of our work.

We hired 20% more young people for summer jobs. We added an additional $76 million on top of that. So we’re in a position to hire 28000 young people for summer jobs. First time in the history of Chicago where you have a community safety deputy mayor. It’s a big deal particularly when it comes to how we address community safety in this city.

So between the bond deal unprecedented quarter of a billion dollars for the unhoused $100 million for violence prevention of course abolishing subminimum wage of course creating paid time off for workers opening up mental health clinics the most diverse administration in the history of Chicago and we’ve done that within the first year of our administration. So I’m very proud that we’ve been able to accomplish everything that I promised that I would do when I ran for office. We’ve accomplished those.

Q: What do you see as the area that most needs improvement within your administration?

A: Well I mean look we’ve had 40 years of gross neglect and disinvestment within the city of Chicago right? And we’re talking about real severe disinvestment. I’m not sure if either one of you were here during the time in which schools were closed. It’s a very profound lasting impact that it has had on the people of Chicago. And when mental health clinics are shuttered that creates a lot of frustration that leaves a gaping hole right? And so part of my responsibility of course is to address the age-old systems of failure and to build a better stronger safer Chicago and that is something that I’m committed to doing. That’s what the people of Chicago elected me to do.

Q: If you could go back to May 15 2023 knowing what you know now about how the migrant crisis would unfold what would you do differently?

A: Well again thank you for acknowledging the fact that I inherited this crisis. When I was sworn in there were people who were sleeping on floors in police districts. They were sleeping on floors in airports right? You had no structure no order at the border and the governor of Texas was committed to creating chaos.

What we have done though as a result of that there are no more people sleeping on floors in police districts. We’ve cleared out the airports. We’ve saved the taxpayers over $200 million through our work of renegotiating contracts that I inherited.

Having reflected over the last year I wish that Congress would actually do its part and pass substantive immigration reform policies and alleviate this responsibility that has been placed on the backs of municipal government which it is not designed to do. And so that is an area that in retrospect had those types of investments been made — whether it’s the city of Chicago or Denver or New York or anywhere else in this country that Gov. Abbott has attacked and targeted — we could be in a much more — we could be in a better position as a country if the federal government would have acted.

Q: As a candidate you once said “Too often the politics of Chicago it forces communities to fight over one pie. My philosophy is: Let’s just make more pies.” As a mayor you have consistently said that Chicago was out of money for migrants while other governments as you just alluded to aren’t helping enough. Was your outlook back then perhaps too optimistic?

A: Again the $1.25 billion bond deal this is again the largest investment that we have experienced as a city. That’s 20 times the amount of dollars that we have made for the migrant mission within the latest investment. What it displays is that you actually can do both and I mean it’s a clear example of doing both. As far as my general optimism about the city of Chicago here’s the most important thing to remember: I came into office with a clear agenda to invest in people — a $1.25 billion bond deal a quarter of a billion dollars into the unhoused $100 million for violence prevention. You know we have established a brand-new office dedicated to those who are returning residents from jails and incarceration. It’s never happened before.

These investments could have been made two administrations ago it could have been three administrations ago. They didn’t do it. I did. And that’s why I’m optimistic in this moment because everything that I said that we need to do as a city together we are doing that. We’re investing in people. And we’re addressing age-old systems that have failed the people of Chicago for too long.

Q: We hear that (Deputy Mayor of Community Safety) Garien Gatewood and a violence interrupter were on the scene Saturday attempting to de-escalate a clash between CPD and (the School of the Art Institute of Chicago) protesters. Did CPD ignore the wishes of the fifth floor when they moved on the protesters anyway?

A: The most important thing here for everyone to remember is that I’m a strong advocate for the First Amendment and particularly protests. I’ve been a part of demonstrations multiple demonstrations. What we also need to make sure that happens is that we keep people safe and that’s the most important thing here.

And so the work to de-escalate is work that is ongoing. The work to keep people safe that’s the most important element here. And we’ve done both of those things. We’re keeping people safe. We’re protecting people’s First Amendment right. And when things get to be more intense we’re pushing for greater de-escalation.

Q: Was the final response the outcome — which led to dozens of arrests — was that necessary?

A: Well in some instances — and I’ve been a part of these demonstrations — in some instances arrests are part of the objective. I’ll say it like that. I’ve taken arrest before. It’s not unprecedented for demonstrators to take arrest. The most important thing though here is that the First Amendment? Protected. Keeping people safe it’s the primary goal and we’ve done both of those.

Q: Let’s talk about the pace of your personnel appointments. For example the ZBA (Zoning Board of Appeals) vacancy that you could have filled upon taking office ultimately cost your administration the approval of a homeless shelter in Uptown. Do you regret not acting sooner in that case and others?

A: Our appointments are working well. We have the most diverse administration in the history of Chicago; 60% of my administration are women. We have more brown folks represented in my administration more Black folks represented in my administration and we’re very proud of that. Whether it’s (Public Health Commissioner) Dr. Olusimbo “Simbo” Ige her leadership (Planning) Commissioner (Ciere) Boatright (Housing Commissioner Lissette) Castañeda the first chief homelessness officer in the history of the city of Chicago (Sendy Soto).

All of our appointments really speak to the values of our administration building better stronger safer communities. And we’re doing it in an equitable just way. And so we’re going to continue to make sure that we get it right and I’m very proud of the administration that I put together.

Q: Speaking of identity: During a Lunar New Year celebration you raised some eyebrows when you said the 11th Ward is one that “has been known for its racism.” I bring this up because some of your critics worry this language is alienating. Are their concerns valid? Or is your description of the 11th Ward fair and necessary?

A: Well I think that the entire city of Chicago certainly no one is going to deny the fact that we’ve had deep segregation in this city. And the fact that for the first time in the history of Chicago you have an Asian American representing the 11th Ward that shows that there’s tremendous progress that’s being made.

And so we have to address the harsh reality in this city that we are hypersegregated that there has been racism expressed in this city whether it be through school closures whether it be the shuttering of mental health clinics whether it be cutting off transportation stops and lines through various communities redlining the push-out of people gentrifying communities. You know these are real issues that we’ve had to face over the course of decades now.

And it’s incumbent upon all of us in this city to address racism that exists around the city while also making sure that we’re building capacity with a variety of voices and perspectives and experiences that can ultimately help build a more unified city. And that’s what we’re doing.

Q: The day after you won in April you told our colleague that you’ve never called 911 before which is a sentiment that other South and West siders have shared with me from time to time. But after ShotSpotter goes away 911 calls will presumably be the main alert system for first responders. Do you envision residents will have to adapt to calling 911 more to fill that gap?

A: Well let me just say where violence has been most pervasive particularly on the West and South sides of the city of Chicago these communities call 911 more than any other group and that’s well-documented. The challenge that we have in this city is that we have not had administrations that were committed to investing in people. I’m committed.

Look community safety is a top priority for me and it’s on the minds of all Chicagoans. Homicides are down in the city. Shootings are down in the city. The 35 most violent beats in the city of Chicago where over 50% of the violent crime occurs in those neighborhoods. Homicides are down 35% shootings are down 31%. The work that we have to continue to do to build a better stronger safer Chicago has to be very clear about how we invest in people.

If 911 is our response to community safety then we already have a failed strategy. That is not my strategy. I’m not committed to failing. I’m committed to investing in people and that’s what I’m doing.

Q: Mayor you’re a champion of the progressive movement here in Chicago. What has shifted in the mood and morale of the movement while you’ve been in office?

A: Well there’s a lot to be excited about. You know again paid time off. We’re talking about 1.38 million people. That’s part of the progressive agenda. We abolished the subminimum wage. It has its vestiges of course in slavery. So Black and brown women we’re talking about 100000 workers who are primarily the workforce of restaurants in particular they’re all going to get raises.

Treatment Not Trauma that policy had been lingering in the city of Chicago for years. We got it done within the first year of my administration. You know again this $1.25 billion bond deal right? We’re talking about $625 million dollars to build homes another $625 million for economic development and resources workforce development as well.

I mean this is a part of the progressive agenda that has been stagnant for now an entire generation. We’ve been able to move with expediency. This is an exciting time for the city of Chicago as we build a better stronger safer city through the lens of progressive politics through the lens of working people. And that we’re very proud of.

Q: That same movement was delivered a pretty big setback when Bring Chicago Home lost and its opponents sought to tie the referendum vote to you. Do you think that association hurt the referendum? And do you think you could have done more to back Bring Chicago Home and get it over the finish line?

A: Well we know there were some legal restraints that I had. I was not able to campaign for it. But let’s be very clear: We dedicated a quarter of a billion dollars to homelessness. We have for the first time in the history of Chicago a homelessness officer. Again this bonds deal was designed to build homes and we’re doing that. We’ve already built 100 affordable housing units since I’ve been in office.

There are another 700 that are in the pipeline as we speak. Look the same forces — and thank you because your publication actually is the source of it — the same forces that worked to stop (Cook County Board President) President John Stroger from moving this same agenda those same forces were in full effect to push back against the will of the people.

The bottom line is this it’s the most important thing: We have to deal with the homelessness crisis in this city and that’s what I’m doing. And so individuals or anyone of interests that are not committed to addressing the homelessness crisis perhaps they have to dig a little bit deeper and understand why they’re actually opposing that because the people of Chicago want us to address homelessness. So in other words their attack was against the people of Chicago.

Q: You have a reputation of being a pretty affable guy but also one common criticism of your administration has been struggles with relationships with some other governments City Council maybe the governor as well. How do you respond to that criticism? Do you think there’s room for improvement there?

A: Well look at what we’ve accomplished. Look at what we’ve accomplished together. Working with City Hall. Again the most substantive paid time-off ordinance in the country abolishing subminimum wage passing Treatment Not Trauma. We’re moving on the execution of plowing the sidewalks. We’re building affordable housing. We have a bond deal.

Working with the state and the county we put together an operation to address this migrant mission. We’ve done that together. Everything that I said that we needed to do that we needed to do it together we’ve accomplished that. And so my relationship with City Council with other executives I’m very proud of the work that we’ve accomplished and what we’ve done together.

Q: You campaigned on a platform of racial justice and unity. But on the floor of the City Council many aldermen especially Black aldermen describe a Chicago and City Council as more and more racially divided. Do you agree with that narrative?

A: Yeah well look 40 years of disinvestment. Whether it’s North Lawndale Englewood Roseland Austin Garfield Park every single crisis that we are dealing with right now I inherited it. There’s not one crisis right now that I caused. Not one.

And I’ve been on the front line fighting for education fighting for mental health services fighting to create more job opportunities for people and we’re doing that. Again we’re talking about the largest investment from a bond deal in the history of Chicago a $1.25 billion bond 100 affordable housing units that have already been built 700 right now in the pipeline.

This new Office for Reentry returning residents will now have a place where an entire department coordinates across city departments and sister agencies; $10 million in home repairs right now for families particularly on the West and South sides of the city of Chicago. And so we are addressing what we inherited. Forty years of neglect and within one year we have made hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and now the largest bond deal in the history of Chicago to address the neglect.

That’s what I was purposed to do: Build homes create economic opportunities for Black Chicago. There are more Black folks in my administration than in the history of this city. And no one else lost because of it. And 60% of my administration made up of women. I’m very proud of the work that we’ve done together.

Q: There’s no doubt that you’ve had a lot of big bold ideas in the agenda that you campaigned on. Those ideas also cost a lot of money. Out of all the other revenue ideas that you floated — a head tax financial transactions jet fuel hotels — which one do you think has the most realistic path to passing in this term?

A: Well the key is what do we ultimately want to do right? Do we want to build more homes that are affordable? Do we want to really create more pathways for our young people? Do we want to make sure that our public education system is fully supported? That’s the real question.

And the other question that we have to answer is: What happens if we don’t invest in those key areas? And so my approach is put the ideas on the table. You give people an opportunity to debate them to discuss them. And then we come to consensus together. Building a better stronger safer Chicago is going to require investments bottom line. I’ve made that very clear.

With the quarter-billion dollars into the unhoused the $1.25 billion bond deal the $100 million for violence prevention. Everyone says that they want to address these issues in our city the segregation the disinvestment. Turns out if you believe in something you’re willing to pay for it.

Q: But out of that process you just laid out what stage are you at in terms of deciding what to prioritize in that revenue package?

A: Those conversations are ongoing. You both know that we have a subcommittee dedicated to revenue. I created that for that very purpose. Look my responsibility in this moment is to bring people together and I’ve done it. I’ve done it consistently. And that’s why this subcommittee exists so that we can have these substantive conversations about what it’s going to take to right the wrongs that we inherited.

We’re talking about 40 years of gross neglect in the city of Chicago. I really want to just drive that point home — 40 years of neglect. It has caused tremendous harm to people. Do you know what that’s like to wake up and you’re not sure if your school is going to exist? Or if it’s fully funded? Do you know what it’s like to wake up and you’re unhoused?

I mean these are severe issues that the people of Chicago are facing and that’s why I’m dedicated to opening up mental health centers that’s why I’ve been pushing so hard for this investment around the unhoused. It’s why this $1.25 billion bond deal is a start in that right direction. And we’ve accomplished all of this in less than a year. Keep that in mind.

It has not even been a year yet. And everything that I said that I would do bring people together to build a better stronger safer Chicago every single platform point we’ve addressed it. And then to your question around our revenue sources there’s an entire committee dedicated to building an infrastructure of revenue that doesn’t place the burden on everyday people.

Q: Have you vetted or looked at potential replacements for CTA President Dorval Carter?

A: Well as you know discussing personnel issues I actually find that to be irresponsible and I’ve said that repeatedly. And so what I’m committed to doing right now is making sure that our ridership continues to go up which it has. We have hired more people which we’ve done that I’ve made a commitment to doing that. Our better streets for buses it’s the first initiative of its kind to build a better street signal sidewalk infrastructure. These are all investments that I have put forward in order to build a CTA that we can be proud of. And again as far as personnel matters I don’t discuss those publicly.

Q: Why?

A: Because it’s not responsible. Should your employer discuss individuals’ employment status out loud about who they’re going to fire and keep?

Q: In fairness though these are also employees not just of yours but of the city right? The CTA president also serves Chicagoans and they have a lot of questions about him and all of the appointments that you make.

A: Having questions about how we build a transportation system that ultimately meets the needs and demands of the people of Chicago those questions are welcome. Determining who I get to fire and hire I find that to be irresponsible and I won’t discuss personnel matters publicly.

Q: Out of all the current CTU demands — 9% raises housing assistance dual-language expansion sports and fine arts at each school more sustainable community schools abortion and gender-affirming care coverage and more — what do you already know that you could say yes to?

A: Well look my vision for public education has been made very clear. I want every single child to have what my children have right? We’re talking about manageable class sizes arts libraries librarians access to the trades. You know that’s what a public education system should entail.

Now I’m a firm believer in sustainable community schools and primarily because it gives you know real ownership of the school community over the actual school. And where there are areas where there’s alignment with my vision and what is being negotiated in the contract we’ll lean into that. And where there are areas that are disjointed we’ll have to work through it. We’ll just have to work through it.

The public education system in this city is another area where there’s been gross neglect. And my job in this moment is to lay out a vision that working families want in their school system. Now who better to help lay out that vision than someone who actually relies upon the school system? I’m the first mayor in the history of Chicago to send their children to the public schools in Chicago. I have a real vested interest in ensuring that every single family can feel proud of their school and that their school is fully supported and resourced.

Now what we also have to recognize is that the state of Illinois conservatively owes us the people of Chicago $1 billion. One billion dollars. And so I’m going to be working with our partners in Springfield to ensure that the people of Chicago get what they deserve.

Q: How does your lived experience as a CPS parent inform some of your education decisions and positions? Can you name a specific policy where you thought about your kids and made your decision?

A: Yeah just access to the arts. Access to a library and a librarian. When I taught in middle school the level of research that I asked my middle schoolers to engage in was pretty substantial. It was. I wanted them to really dig deeper into their lessons. Not to have any library or a librarian I could not imagine teaching at the time in which I taught and not have the ability to take my children to the library.

And that’s something as simple and as fundamental as a librarian I just want to emphasize this because sometimes I think we brush past that really fast. Just think about your own personal journeys: What if you did not have a library or librarian to reference as you developed your skill set to become the professionals that you are today? Children in Chicago are being denied a library and a librarian.

The second thing is class sizes. When the school was closed when I taught we inherited an entire school. Our class sizes ballooned. When you are a middle school teacher there are 35 38 children in your classroom and you literally have desks stuffed in corners it is almost — it is impossible to have full engagement with 35 38 children in your classrooms. Impossible. We managed it but it’s impossible. That’s the second thing.

The third thing is this: The number of children who experience trauma every single day because they were unhoused their parents are unemployed or underemployed and when that trauma shows up in your classroom I can tell you they’re not always thinking about the causes of the American Revolution or comma splices or the author’s main point. They’re thinking about food. They’re thinking about sleep. Those are the three areas that I can tell you emphatically as a public school teacher if you don’t address those dynamics you can’t say that you’re really in for the public good.

Q: If I can zoom in on a specific moment in your migrant crisis response. You know the Brighton Park base camp plan generated some of the biggest pushback you’ve seen against your administration. Looking back do you think that set you back with building trust on that issue? And is there a lesson to be learned from that?

A: Well again the chaos at the border has still not gone addressed. Part of the challenge in this moment is the frustration that the people of Chicago have we’re not giving enough attention to where that frustration is really based out of. You have a governor of Texas who was out of control.

We had 15000 migrants in shelters at its height. There are 8000 now. We’ve saved the taxpayers $200 million. Do you know not a bus has arrived in the city of Chicago since the end of December? Not one bus. Why? Because we put forth a structure that I promised that I would do to create a real operation that’s centered around people’s humanity.

Look I’ve said from the very beginning this mission is unsustainable for a local municipality. Because local government is not designed to address an international migrant crisis. We are being woefully neglected by the federal government and primarily because you have a former president who is controlling the Republican Party.

And so what I’ve done is created an infrastructure that is operationalized that is centered around people’s dignity and humanity under severe circumstances in which we don’t have control of what’s happening at the border. We continue to work hard to save taxpayer dollars while still making investments. All of the investments that I’ve already laid out I’m sure you probably can repeat them.

Q: If I could walk down memory lane one of the first things I remember you telling me right after George Floyd’s murder is “I wanted to destroy every bit of a system that would permit such a heinous crime.” Obviously as mayor now you oversee a large police department you have a security detail and you’ve had to stand behind the CPD seal at pressers. Has it been strange to grapple with this adjustment so soon after living through the rawness of 2020 and being a Black man?

A: Well the system that we are referring to is quite frankly it’s a system of oppression. And that manifests across the board. I just talked to you very candidly about how the education system has also been an oppressive system right? We know that from the Civil Rights Movement the movement really began to take form around the fight for public transportation.

Policing is no different than any other system that has been mired by an oppressive ideology. And it is still my desire to dismantle the oppressive structures that prevent us from experiencing justice.

Look law enforcement has a responsibility to serve people and to protect. But it is not the responsibility alone of law enforcement to address some of these other critical issues. We continue to rely upon the police system for everything and that’s a problem.

You know as far as grappling with the contradictions that exist within our society that’s something that we all work through whether you’re a woman a woman of color a Black man. Advocating for better structures that have historically left marginalized people behind that is the optimism that perhaps you speak of. If our people Black and brown people women would have given up on these systems you and I wouldn’t be here. And so we continue to push these systems to respond to the needs of people.

The most important thing to note here is that the progress that we have made in less than a year the billions of dollars of investment dealing with the migrant crisis bringing down homicides and shootings moving forward with our progressive agenda that really speaks to working people and the people of Chicago that’s the part that I’m leaning into most. It’s an exciting time for the city of Chicago and I’m looking forward to the work that I will do with every resident of this city together. Thank you both.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNyaW1zb24uY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAyNC81LzEzL2JyZWFjaGVkLWxvY2stcHJvdGVzdC1oYXJ2YXJkLXBvbGljZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Police Say Harvard Affiliates Likely Cut Johnson Gate Lock During Saturday Protest | News,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWNyaW1zb24uY29tL2FydGljbGUvMjAyNC81LzEzL2JyZWFjaGVkLWxvY2stcHJvdGVzdC1oYXJ2YXJkLXBvbGljZS_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E298BF70>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The Giants drafted the 6-foot-6 259-pound Johnson in Round 4 No. 107 overall. Can Johnson develop into a more productive NFL player than he was as a college player?

“It’s really exciting for me because I think I have a super high ceiling. I think I haven’t even scratched the surface of what I’m capable of. I’m really looking forward to proving every day that I’m out here” Johnson said Saturday after the second of two rookie mini-camp practices.

“I think I have tremendous room to improve. I think I can grow a lot more than where I’m at right now. I think that’s why I’m so excited. I’m coming in here with a learning mindset. I want to develop respect from my teammates and my coaches. I think that’s going to help me continue to grow and improve. But I’m super excited to get to work and get going here because I think I have a potential to be a really special player here.”

The Giants certainly hope so. They traded for veteran Darren Waller a year ago hoping he could be a difference-making tight end. After one mediocre season in which leg injuries limited his availability Waller might retire.

That likely is part of the reason the Giants drafted Johnson.

“I think the big thing for me is consistency. Being consistent” Johnson said. “I’ll flash a lot of really good things on tape but it’s putting all that stuff together every single snap that’s going to help me reach my potential.

“Consistency comes from repetition doing it a lot and then being very detail oriented. Being very honest with yourself when you’re watching film and then having a coach that’s going to hold you to that standard every single day and not let the little stuff slide. I think that’s a big part of having consistent technique.”

Johnson understands that tight end is not a simple position to play.

“Tight end is a lot even at the college level. You’re just asked to do so much and that’s why I think it’s a great position” Johnson said. “Everything you’re asked to do it’s very unique. It’s not just a one-tool guy. The best tight ends are able to do everything. I think that’s really cool for a guy like me that I feel like I have the potential to do all the things that you can ask a tight end to do and be a guy that you can’t take off the field.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vc3BvcnRzLnlhaG9vLmNvbS9qaW1teS1qb2huc29uLWxlZ2VuZGFyeS00OWVyLWhhbGwtMDI0MzA4ODI3Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Jimmy Johnson legendary 49er Hall of Famer dies at 86,"May 9 (UPI) -- Former NFL legend Jimmy Johnson who spent his entire 16-year pro football career with the San Francisco 49ers and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1994 is dead at 86 the Hall announced Thursday.

""Jimmy Johnson was extraordinarily athletically talented"" Hall of Fame President Jim Porter said in Thursday's statement. ""The 49ers enjoyed the luxury of using him on offense and defense early in his career to fill team needs. Once he settled in at left cornerback he flourished. The notion that a 'lockdown' cornerback could cut the field in half for the opposition was true with Jimmy. Only rarely would other teams' quarterbacks even look in his direction and more often than not regretted the decision if they challenged him.""

The 49ers organization also expressed its condolences in a social media post.

And the team released a statement marking his passing.

""The 49ers family is deeply saddened by the passing of one of the NFL's all-time greats Jimmy Johnson. Jimmy embodied the essence of what it meant to be a 49er"" the team statement said. ""He was the ultimate gentleman and will be remembered for his humility kindness and loveable demeanor. We send our condolences to his wife Gisela and his entire family at this difficult time.""

While Johnson displayed prowess on both sides of the ball boasting - 47 career interceptions in 213 games with 615 return yards he also hauled in 40 receptions for 690 yards and four touchdowns in two seasons as a wide receiver.

One of the greatest players in 49ers' history especially on the defensive side of the ball Johnson was among the original ""shutdown"" cornerbacks in football. Former 49ers quarterback John Brodie once said that veteran quarterbacks didn't throw Johnson's way because of the fear of being intercepted.

""Jim doesn't receive much publicity because the opposition avoids him as much as possible"" Brodie said back when they were teammates via the Pro Football Hall of Fame website. ""Talk to veteran quarterbacks like John Unitas and Bart Starr and they'll tell you they call a few pass patterns in Jimmy's area.

""The only reason Johnson doesn't lead the league in interceptions is he doesn't get the chance.""

When Johnson retired following his 1976 campaign no NFL player had turned in more seasons at defensive back than he had. At that time Johnson's 201 games and 198 starts were each the most for a DB in league history.

His interceptions and INT return yards remain second in 49ers history behind only fellow Hall of Famer Ronnie Lott (51 interceptions 643 yards) the Hall of Fame said.

Jimmy Johnson born James Earl played his college football at UCLA but was also a great track athlete away from the football field but his brother was even better. Radar won a gold medal in the decathlon in the 1960 Summer Olympics.

""Jimmy"" Johnson played college ball at UCLA. But Johnson wasn't just a football standout for the Bruins -- he was also exceptional on the track though not quite as good as his brother. Jimmy Johnson won All-American honors and an NCAA 100-meter championship while his brother Rafer garnered a gold medal in the decathlon at the 1960 Summer Olympics.

Jimmy Johnson was the 6th overall pick in the 1961 NFL Draft and made his presence felt right away in his rookie year with 5 catches in his first dozen games. He achieved Pro Bowl status from 1969 to 1972.

Johnson died Wednesday evening the Hall of Fame and 49ers announced.

The federal lawsuit filed in New York accused the bank of having “facilitated sustained and concealed” Epstein’s human trafficking network.

On Dec. 27 then-Virgin Islands Attorney General Denise George filed a blistering and heavily redacted 30-page lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase.

“JP Morgan turned a blind eye to evidence of human trafficking over more than a decade because of Epstein’s own financial footprint and because of the deals and clients that Epstein brought and promised to bring to the bank” the lawsuit alleged. “These decisions were advocated and approved at the senior levels of JP Morgan including by the former chief executive of its asset management division and investment bank whose inappropriate relationship with Epstein should have been evident to the bank. Indeed it was only after Epstein’s death that JP Morgan belatedly complied with federal banking regulations regarding Epstein’s accounts.”

Epstein victims who sued anonymously in a pair of class action complaints previously had accused JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank of “complicity” in the sex trafficking scheme. Though Epstein died in jail before his trial his co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell was tried convicted and sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Days after the AG’s filing of the lawsuit — on New Year’s Eve — George was removed from her post. Local news outlets in the Virgin Islands reported that the attorney general had not informed the territory’s Gov. Albert Bryan about her impending enforcement action.

George’s office did not immediately respond to Law&Crime’s email requesting comment on Monday a federally observed holiday.

The development was first reported by The Virgin Islands Consortium citing anonymous sources. Bryan subsequently confirmed George’s termination — without providing an explanation for it — in a statement sent to multiple news outlet.

“I relieved Denise George of her duties as attorney general this weekend” Bryan wrote in a statement sent to Law&Crime. “I thank her for her service to the people of the territory during the past four years as attorney general and wish her the best in her future endeavors.”

The governor’s spokesman declined to elaborate telling Law&Crime: “I am not at liberty to discuss details on personnel matters.”

Bryan reportedly appointed Assistant Attorney General Carol Thomas-Jacobs to serve as acting attorney general. Thomas-Jacobs who also did not immediately respond to Law&Crime’s press inquiry also worked on the Epstein investigation court documents show.

George had led the office when Thomas-Jacobs signed her name to a complaint suing Epstein’s estate under the territory’s Criminally Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (CICO) enforcement action the local equivalent of a racketeering lawsuit. That action accused the estate’s executors Darren K. Indyke and Richard D. Kahn of acting as Epstein’s “indispensable captains.”

Both denied those allegations and did not concede wrongdoing under the recent settlement which called upon the estate to keep providing documents for the attorney general’s “ongoing investigation.”

The case that George filed against JPMorgan Chase before her departure has been marked as related to the proposed class action lawsuits filed in the same court against JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank currently pending before Senior U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff. Those now-consolidated cases have been scheduled for trial in the Southern District of New York in the summer of 2023.

Listen to Law&Crime’s podcast Objections: with Adam Klasfeld below for a rundown on what the new year may hold for the Epstein saga.

If you still need to do some grocery shopping before cooking your family’s traditional feast your options are more limited if you wait until Thursday to get your ingredients.

Two of the largest food retailers in the country Walmart and Target will be closed on Thanksgiving. However Kroger is keeping its doors open until at least mid-afternoon on Thanksgiving.

See info about Meijer Aldi and Costco here.

Walmart Is Closed on Thanksgiving for the 3rd Year in a Row

Walmart used to be one of the major retailers that always stayed open on Thanksgiving. But the chain reversed course starting back in 2020 as Heavy reported at the time.

For the third year in a row Walmart will be closed on Thanksgiving. On the home page of the website Walmart reminded customers that they can still shop for Black Friday deals online while stores are closed.

In a press release from 2021 company leaders stressed the importance of rewarding its employees with a holiday break: “Closing our stores on Thanksgiving Day is one way we’re saying ‘thank you’ to our teams for their dedication and hard work this year. We hope everyone will take the opportunity to be with their loved ones during what’s always a special time.”

Although not classified as a supermarket Walmart is the top-selling food retailer in the United States according to Progressive Grocer.

Target Will Always Close on Thanksgiving In the Future

If you need to do some last-minute shopping you need to get to Target before Thursday. All Target locations will be closed on Thanksgiving Day.

Company leaders announced in 2021 that this holiday schedule would be the new standard every year moving forward.

CEO Brian Cornell announced last year: “I’m making it official: We’re going to keep our stores closed on future Thanksgivings too. What started as a temporary measure driven by the pandemic is now our new standard — one that recognizes our ability to deliver on our guests’ holiday wishes both within and well beyond store hours. You don’t have to wonder whether this is the last Thanksgiving you’ll spend with family and friends for a while because Thanksgiving store hours are one thing we won’t ‘get back to’ when the pandemic finally subsides.”

Kroger Is Operating on Reduced Hours on Thanksgiving

Kroger stores are typically open until 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. but on Thanksgiving all stores will close earlier than normal. Shoppers can expect Kroger stores to close between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m. on Thursday depending on the region. Most pharmacies however will be closed for the holiday.

For many area sports figures and teams 2023 brings another year of hope and opportunity.

Here are 10 New Year’s resolutions for some D-FW sports teams and athletes.

Advertisement

1. Be less generous to opponents — Dak Prescott

Dak Prescott has been a little too in the giving mood this holiday season. The Cowboys’ QB has 14 interceptions this season and 13 in the 10 games he’s played returning from his thumb injury.

Prescott has already thrown a career-high 14 — and there’s still one more regular-season game remaining. Prescott will need to take better care of the ball if Dallas hopes to make a playoff run in the new year.

2. Keep chasing your dreams — Mark Cuban

Entering the new year Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is already chasing his next big dream.

In an interview with The Dallas Morning News in Dec. 2022 Cuban said he spoke of his Vegas-like vision for Dallas and the Mavericks’ new arena.

“My goal and we’d partner with Las Vegas Sands is when we build a new arena it’ll be in the middle of a resort and casino” Cuban said. “That’s the mission.”

Cuban is the first Texas team owner to publicly declare a desire to partner with a casino for a resort-arena development.

Maybe 2023 will be the year Cuban takes a step toward turning his Vegas-like dream into a reality.

3. Bring Texas back — Arch Manning

Sarkisian’s biggest recruiting catch star quarterback Arch Manning arrives to Texas in 2023.

Manning the top recruit in the nation comes from a long line of notable quarterbacks. He is the grandson of Archie and nephew of Peyton and Eli.

A Longhorns fan base that hasn’t had a lot to cheer for since a national title appearance in 2009 is expecting a lot from the incoming freshman in 2023. Can Manning alone propel the Longhorns back to college football relevancy?

No pressure Arch.

4. Stay healthy this year — Jacob deGrom

The Texas Rangers made a big splash this offseason by signing former New York Mets pitcher Jacob deGrom.

Although deGrom is considered one of the top pitchers in the majors he also has a history of injuries that have kept him from competing at the highest level in recent seasons. Elbow inflammation limited deGrom to 156 1/3 innings pitched over 26 starts over the last two years. A stress reaction in his right scapula forced him to miss the first four months of 2022.

As the face of the Rangers’ revamped pitching rotation it is imperative for deGrom to stay out of injury trouble if the Rangers want to return to the postseason for the first time since 2016.

5. Enjoy Joe Pavelski’s golden years — Dallas Stars

In his 17th NHL season age has been nothing more than a number for Stars center Joe Pavelski.

The 38-year-old is third on the team with 37 points (12 goals 25 assists) and has been a key fixture on a Stars team that is sitting on top of the Western Conference.

In the final stage of his career Pavelski has played some of his best hockey and the Stars need to keep on tapping the well until it runs dry.

Entering the new year that’s exactly what the Stars are doing. They announced a one-year contract extension with Pavelski on Sunday the first day of 2023.

6. Control your temper — Luka Doncic

Technical fouls continue to plague Luka Doncic which is about the only complaint you can have with his game these days. Doncic is having yet another MVP-caliber season averaging a league-high 34.2 points along with 8.7 rebounds and 8.9 assists as the Mavericks entered 2023 on a season-best six-game win streak.

Advertisement

However Doncic has nine technical fouls in just 34 games this season — and that’s not counting the one recently rescinded by the league.

NBA players earn a one-game suspension after their 16th technical foul (and another game for every two techs after that). At this rate Doncic is on pace to get suspended more than once during the 82-game regular season.

Since entering the league in 2018 Doncic has 55 technical fouls. If he wants to slow down his technical foul rate Doncic might need to try some different methods in 2023 especially since these Mavs seem to only go as far as he does.

7. Make the most of your opportunity — Sonny Dykes TCU

In his first year at TCU after leaving rival SMU Sonny Dykes has taken the Horned Frogs where they have never gone before.

Dykes led TCU to not only the first College Football Playoff berth for the program but also for any Texas school. And after that TCU became the first Big 12 school to actually win a CFP game after its stunning 51-45 win over No. 2 Michigan. The Horned Frogs are set to face No. 1 Georgia for the national title on Jan. 9.

While TCU has certainly overachieved this season but Sonny why stop here when you can win the whole thing?

With the College Football Playoff on track to expand to 12 teams in 2024 there will be more opportunities for non-SEC teams like TCU to make it to the tournament. However with more teams comes more games meaning more wins will be needed.

The only certainty for Dykes and TCU is the opportunity right in front of them and they need to take advantage of it.

8. Help the Dallas Wings take the next step — Latricia Trammell

After making the playoffs for two straight seasons the Wings got their first-ever playoff win in 2022. However it wasn’t enough to move past the first round and the Wings declined to pick up the option on head coach Vickie Johnson’s contract.

Now Latricia Trammell takes over as the Wings’ fourth head coach since 2018. No Wings head coach has lasted for more than two seasons since Fred Williams who was fired during the 2018 season after five years with the organization dating back to its time as the Tulsa Shock.

Advertisement

If Trammell wants to become the head coach who sticks she will need to help this young but talented roster take the next step in 2023 by getting past the opening round of the playoffs. Since moving to Dallas the Wings have made it to playoffs four times — all first-round exits.

Trammell has some solid young weapons including two-time WNBA All-Star Arike Ogunbowale and 2021 All-Star Satou Sabally. With another year of experience and a talented young roster Trammell has a chance to build the Wings into a perennial playoff contender.

9. Have more patience — Jesús Ferreira

FC Dallas star Jesús Ferreira’s selection to the U.S. Men’s National Team for the World Cup was a thrill for virtually every soccer fan in D-FW but the 22-year-old striker had to wait until the knockout stage to get into a game. Many were left wondering why he’d been brought along if he wasn’t going to get on the pitch especially when the USMNT seemed to struggle with offense throughout the World Cup.

Ferreira ended up starting the knockout round match against the Netherlands an eventual 3-1 defeat for the U.S. but his effect on the game was minimal and he was subbed off to start the second half.

Ferreira will have to wait four years for another shot on the massive stage that is the World Cup.

10. End the D-FW title drought — Cowboys Mavs Stars & Rangers

It has been nearly 12 years since the last championship for one of the area’s core four sports teams.

Advertisement

The Mavericks were the last team from the area to win a title back in 2011.

Since then some have come close. The Stars made it all the way to the Stanley Cup Final in 2020 but fell in six games to the Tampa Bay Lightning. The Mavs last season made it to the Western Conference finals before falling to the eventual NBA-champion Golden State Warriors.

Others haven’t. The Cowboys haven’t made it past the divisional round since winning their last super bowl in 1996. The Rangers haven’t come close to a World Series berth since failing on two opportunities in 2010-11.

Winning a championship is the common goal for each of these teams. Will 2023 be the year a D-FW team finally breaks through?

New computed tomography (CT) technology and an innovative security lane configuration are streamlining the security process for passengers at Frankfurt Airport.

The CT scanners mean travellers will no longer need to remove laptops and liquids from hand luggage while also reducing the number of secondary checks needed and ultimately leading to shorter wait times. In the long-term Fraport plans to deploy the new equipment across all checkpoints.

Since 1 January 2023 Fraport has assumed responsibility for the organisation management and performance of the security checkpoints at Frankfurt Airport. The German Federal Police who were previously tasked with these responsibilities will continue to hold statutory oversight and supervision roles as well as overall responsibility for aviation security. They will also continue to provide armed protection at checkpoints certification and approval of new checkpoint infrastructure and handle the certification and recertification process for aviation security personnel.

Three service providers have been commissioned to conduct passenger screening on behalf of Fraport from 1 January 2023: FraSec Aviation Security GmbH (FraSec) I-SEC Deutsche Luftsicherheit SE & Co. KG (I-Sec) and Securitas Aviation Service GmbH & Co. KG (Securitas). In addition state-of-the-art CT scanners from Smiths Detection have been deployed at six selected aviation security lanes. The German Federal Police tested the reliability of the CT technology during a trial in September 2022.

Meanwhile a new security lane design from Vanderlande known as ‘MX2’ is providing further security efficiencies. The innovative concept which uses a CT scanner from Leidos enables passengers to place their hand luggage on both sides of the scanner and retrieve it in the same way. A trial operation got underway in Terminal 1’s Concourse A in January 2023.

“I’m pleased that Fraport – as the operator of Frankfurt Airport – is now able to assume more responsibility for security checks” said Dr. Stefan Schulte CEO Fraport. “This will allow us to bring our experience and skills into the operational management of aviation security. By deploying new technology and innovative lane designs at Germany’s largest aviation gateway we can provide our customers and passengers with greater convenience and shorter wait times while maintaining our high security standards. Over the past few months our team worked towards this starting date quickly and with a high level of commitment. The transition ran smoothly from the outset thanks to our partnership with the security service providers FraSec I-Sec and Securitas. I offer my sincere thanks to everyone who was involved.”",,,,,,,,,,,,

Burnett Plaza the tallest building in Fort Worth Texas has been purchased via foreclosure auction for $12.3 million just three years after it was sold for more than $137.5 million according to the Dallas Business Journal.

The 40-story behemoth was bought back by Pinnacle Bank Texas in the auction held on the steps of the Tarrant County courthouse on Tuesday.

Pinnacle had claimed in public filings that the tower's former owner Burnett Cherry Street LLC an affiliate of New York-based Opal Holdings LLC defaulted on a $13 million loan used to purchase the building in 2021.

The bank bought it back with a roughly $12.3 million credit bid just $12.30 per square foot.

As well as being the tallest in Fort Worth Burnett Plaza is also considered the largest with over one million square feet of commercial office and retail space according to its website.

Constructed in 1983 the distinctive block-sized complex stands at 567 feet tall at 801 Cherry St. and is surrounded by a public urban park.

It was most recently appraised at $104.5 million by Tarrant Appraisal District according to the Dallas Business Journal. Tenants include General Motors Financial Kimley-Horn and Associates Huckabee as well as Freese and Nichols.

The Dallas Business Journal reports that contractors filed 10 mechanic’s liens totaling more than $1.6 million against Opal alleging unpaid renovation work at the site. The largest amounting to nearly $1 million was filed by Tarrant Construction Services for renovations of two suites and the 19th-floor bathrooms.

The settlement which follows an investigation from a coalition of 50 attorneys general requires the three companies to make their advertisements more transparent.

Under the terms of the agreement Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T can only advertise their plans as “unlimited” if there are no limits on how much data someone can use during a billing cycle. The ads must “clearly and conspicuously” say that restrictions on speed may apply as well as specify the amount of data customers can use before triggering the slowdown.

Additionally the attorneys general went after the allegedly misleading claims Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T made in ads promising to “pay” customers to switch carriers. All three companies must now clearly disclose the terms and conditions associated with the offer including how much a customer will be paid and when they will receive their payment. The carriers must also disclose the requirements customers must meet to receive “free” phone offers along with any hidden fees.

“AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile lied to millions of consumers making false promises of free phones and ‘unlimited’ data plans that were simply untrue” New York Attorney General Letitia James says in a statement. “Big companies are not excused from following the law and cannot trick consumers into paying for services they will never receive.”

Verizon T-Mobile and AT&T will also have to appoint a “dedicated representative” to field customer complaints. The three companies deny any wrongdoing. “These voluntary agreements reflect no finding of improper conduct and reaffirm the wireless industry’s longstanding commitment to clarity and integrity in advertising so that consumers can make informed decisions about the products and services that best suit them” Nick Ludlum the senior vice president of the CTIA the trade group representing the carriers tells The Verge.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9iaXRjb2luLXdoYWxlLXdhbGxldHMtbW92ZS1zaXh0eS1taWxsaW9uLWluLWJpdGNvaW4tYWZ0ZXItZGVjYWRlLWRvcm1hbmN50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Bitcoin whale wallets move $61M in BTC after a decade of dormancy,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vY29pbnRlbGVncmFwaC5jb20vbmV3cy9iaXRjb2luLXdoYWxlLXdhbGxldHMtbW92ZS1zaXh0eS1taWxsaW9uLWluLWJpdGNvaW4tYWZ0ZXItZGVjYWRlLWRvcm1hbmN50gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E5D920E0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Pacheco who is not only a producer but a high-powered talent agent and sometime actor—he has appeared in The Hangover and Entourage—has worked with Martin Scorsese Bruce Willis Mike Tyson and Elvis’ granddaughter Riley Keough and runs in the same circles as Ben Affleck Nick Cassavetes and Woody Harrelson. He has made headlines for among other things tangling with paparazzi while partying with Jamie Foxx.

But there appears to be a far less-glittery side to Pacheco’s seemingly charmed life. According to a bombshell search warrant affidavit obtained by The Daily Beast the movie mogul also allegedly owes nearly $8 million in back taxes to the IRS which has been unable to get its money because Pacheco claims he’s broke.

While Pacheco’s tax preparer was telling the government that his client “had a bad year… and has no money” federal investigators say Pacheco whom they describe in the warrant affidavit as “an avid gambler” is as flush as he’s ever been instead having spent many times the amount of his outstanding tax debt on fine art fancy cars and Las Vegas card tables. (The IRS says it has been trying to collect from Pacheco for so long the original revenue officer assigned to the case has now retired.)

The ongoing investigation into Pacheco’s alleged criminal activity has not been previously reported. The feds accuse him of a laundry list of violations including conspiracy to defraud the United States of America money laundering bank fraud false statements tax evasion subscription to a false tax return aiding and assisting in the preparation of a false tax return and attempting to interfere with the administration of internal revenue laws.

“We have no comment” Ciaran McEvoy a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles where the investigation is taking place said in an email on Friday.

Pacheco has not been charged according to court records. McEvoy declined to provide additional information about whether any charges are in the offing.

Pacheco referred The Daily Beast to Nathaniel Hochman the attorney representing him in the matter. Hochman declined to comment on the record for this article or to make Pacheco available for an interview.

However a source close to Pacheco who has direct knowledge of the situation called the case “total BS.” The IRS has “mischaracterized” parts of the narrative included in the affidavit according to the source who told The Daily Beast that Pacheco disputes the exact amount he owes believing his actual liability is less than $2 million.

Pacheco the source said has already had his paychecks garnished for more than $700000 and has more than enough equity in the multiple homes he owns to cover his debt completely.

“Chuck didn’t do what they’re saying he did” the source argued. “He just didn’t. The government has not brought criminal charges in almost two years. If they thought this was such a strong case they would have brought the case two years ago.”

For its part the IRS says Pacheco made a few scattered payments that failed to make a dent in his obligations and has been ducking its agents ever since.

The IRS processes some 130 million individual tax returns annually but resources are tight and enforcement is selective. In 2023 the agency’s Criminal Investigations division (IRS-CI) opened just 104 cases. Accordingly the IRS focuses its limited resources on going after high-profile names in large part to create a deterrent effect on others thinking about shortchanging Uncle Sam. Criminal prosecutions of A-listers tend to make headlines as do those involving B-listers C-listers and even D-listers. The IRS Criminal Investigations division boasts an 88.4 percent conviction rate explaining “Publicity of these convictions provides a deterrent effect that enhances voluntary compliance.”

In October 2015 Pacheco filed a tax return for the previous year claiming net income of $19238098 from gambling and withholding in the amount of $60852 according to the affidavit. It says Pacheco calculated he owed the IRS a total of $7102674 for 2014 which took into account a $100000 payment he had already submitted.

Having not gotten payment an IRS revenue officer called Pacheco’s tax preparer a Woodland Hills California CPA-cum-lawyer named Jeffrey Helfer who “allegedly committed numerous acts to evade payment of the taxes due and owing to the IRS and to obstruct its collection efforts of Pacheco’s 2014 tax liability” the affidavit states.

“Since April 2016 Helfer made false statements to the IRS on behalf of Pacheco that included that he did not have access to Pacheco’s financial information and that Pacheco was financially unable to pay his taxes” the affidavit alleges. “For years Helfer delayed the IRS’s collection efforts for Pacheco by promising returns and documents to the IRS.”

Helfer did not respond to The Daily Beast’s requests for comment.

The revenue officer told Helfer that the IRS had identified accounts in Pacheco’s name at Wells Fargo Bank of America JPMorgan Chase Bank and City National Bank “as sources from which [it] could potentially collect” the affidavit says. The very next day Pacheco formed an LLC called Nine Nights All-Star Weekend registering it with the California Secretary of State as an entertainment company the affidavit goes on. A week later Pacheco began wiring money to a bank account controlled by Helfer who the following month used a different account to wire several million dollars back to Pacheco according to the affidavit.

In attempts to confuse investigators and keep his money “out of the reach of the IRS” the affidavit claims Pacheco regularly transferred massive amounts of cash over the course of at least four years to Helfer who stashed some of it in attorney-client trust accounts and sent some to bank accounts in Macau and Singapore; Helfer’s adult son who is in the Christmas tree jack-o’-lantern and parking lot businesses; and a private investor he met through Helfer’s brother an accountant.

The money was rapidly funneled back and forth through a series of short-term loans to Pacheco all but one of which were not collateralized or formally documented along with various accounts controlled by Helfer who the affidavit says “often mov[ed] funds with no apparent purpose.”

“Based on what I learned through this investigation I believe that Pacheco and Helfer were moving Pacheco’s money in this manner to avoid IRS levies on Pacheco’s accounts” an IRS investigator writes in the affidavit.

According to the affidavit when Pacheco received funds back from Helfer he never used them to pay down his tax debt but rather “quickly disbursed them from his account to pay his debts at casinos or with gambling associates buy art or pay his American Express credit card bills.”

In one example Pacheco bid $2045000 on a piece of art at a Christie’s auction on May 8 2016 wiring the money roughly six weeks after that the affidavit states. Although it provides no further details about the work in question a review of the official auction results show only one piece sold that day at that price: Tripod a nine-foot fiberglass resin and steel sculpture by American contemporary artist Paul McCarthy.

On May 11 2016 the affidavit alleges Pacheco purchased another piece from Christie’s this time with a $1150000 winning bid at an auction that included works from the collections of publishing magnate S.I. Newhouse and Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. The feds say Pacheco made good on the payment the following month transferring the money from his All-Star Weekend account to a personal account at First Republic Bank then wiring the funds to the auction house from there.

Pacheco also spent millions on artworks at Sotheby’s outbidding others at a Feb. 10 2016 auction in London according to the affidavit. Investigators say he later wired a partial payment of $1534561.73 to Sotheby's from his personal account at Wells Fargo followed by another $1379431.86 to cover the balance.

The IRS says it tracked millions more that Pacheco used for personal luxuries over his IRS debt listing among a slew of other pricey expenditures a $469000 wire to the Bellagio Hotel & Casino in Las Vegas in Las Vegas Nevada; a $939000 wire to the Aria Resort and Casino also in Vegas; and a $350000 wire to luxury car dealership Whittington Motor Sports.

“The equity in the properties the IRS has liened [is] over $10 million” the source close to Pacheco told The Daily Beast. “At any time the IRS could have enforced the liens forced a sale of the properties and paid itself in full. They have never done this and could do it today if they wanted. As such it doesn’t matter what Pacheco… does with the rest of [his] money or assets.”

One of the “gambling associates” named in the affidavit is billionaire investor Alec Gores who hired John Legend to perform at his star-studded December 2016 wedding to powerhouse writer/director/producer Kelly Noonan. In this instance according to the affidavit the money flowed only one way to the tune of nearly $11 million from Pacheco to Gores who is not accused of any wrongdoing.

Another gambling buddy is identified in the affidavit as Bosko Djordjevic a Serbian “film director and cinematographer who participated in high stakes poker games.” Again instead of paying the IRS Pacheco in October 2016 wired $1.1 million to Djordjevic and dipped further into his secret cash reserves that same month to wire $950000 to the Bellagio.

A third late businessman and poker icon Sam Magid received a $110000 check from Pacheco in 2017 according to the affidavit.

At a meeting with Helfer on Feb. 2 2017 the IRS collection officer told Helfer that she planned to file liens a week later on Pacheco’s properties in order to satisfy his tax debt the affidavit states. On Feb. 3 2017 Pacheco sold his condo on the Las Vegas Strip for $1.1 million according to the affidavit. The funds were deposited that same day into Pacheco’s personal account at Wells Fargo after which he immediately “made multiple transfers” from there into three different business accounts he also maintained at Wells.

Soon after the IRS pushed forward with an intent to levy the next step in the lien procedure Pacheco moved more than $3 million from his personal accounts into ones controlled by Helfer according to the affidavit. It claims Helfer then shifted much of the money back to one of Pacheco’s corporate accounts which were not subject to the IRS levy again frustrating the IRS’ attempts to collect the affidavit says.

Helfer according to the affidavit would spend “years” promising the IRS that Pacheco’s subsequent tax returns “would include net operating losses that when carried back would result in no tax due for 2014. This never came to pass.”

In late September 2016 Helfer submitted Pacheco’s 2015 return to the IRS along with a form requesting a “tentative refund” along with Pacheco’s “revised second amended income tax returns for… 2013 and 2014” according to the affidavit.

“However” the affidavit contends “even with the carried back losses the 2015 form 1045 showed Pacheco’s tax liability for 2014 remained at more than $5 million.”

Helfer would continue running interference for Pacheco telling the IRS over and over in 2016 that payment in full was on its way according to the affidavit. The affidavit includes a slew of excuses Helfer floated for delay after delay claiming when an IRS representative inquired about why such a large balance remained due that his cellphone was out of range and that he would call back when he got to the office.

“When [the IRS officer] called Helfer’s office at 10:45 a.m. Helfer’s assistant told her Helfer was out of the office at a meeting” the affidavit states.

Later that day Helfer called back and promised Pacheco “would send in a voluntary payment” according to the affidavit. Helfer insisted that an IRS lien would “destroy Pacheco’s business opportunities” and that Pacheco would make good on the tax bill within 60 days it says. The following month Helfer vowed Pacheco would be sending a check in a week which allegedly never came. A month after that Helfer swore payment “was forthcoming.”

Three weeks later Helfer claimed to have sent a check for Pacheco but said “it must have been sent to the wrong office thus he would stop payment on that check and issue a new one” according to the affidavit. In mid-January 2017 having not received any payments at all the IRS officer on the case called Helfer whose assistant said he was out of the country until the end of the month.

At the end of her rope the affidavit says the IRS revenue officer handling the Pacheco case issued levies on “all known bank accounts held in Pacheco’s name.” Throughout 2017 the IRS continued to place levies on Pacheco’s bank accounts and garnished his wages throughout 2018 “but got little to satisfy Pacheco’s tax debt.”

When the revenue officer retired in April 2019 Pacheco’s collection case was transferred to a new IRS employee according to the affidavit. But having not received an updated power of attorney form from Helfer “for months after requesting it” in March 2020 the new revenue officer showed up at Pacheco’s house unannounced.

“In sum Pacheco [said] he would apply for a payment plan to pay his outstanding tax debt and referred [the revenue officer] to Helfer” the affidavit states.

A year later the IRS still hadn’t received its money. In April 2020 Pacheco submitted a list of his assets to the IRS claiming his eponymous corporation was worth $0 that he had about $250000 in personal assets that consisted of “misc furniture/personal effects” and that he did not own or lease any vehicles. Yet according to the affidavit Pacheco in fact had two leased Bentleys and owned more than $9 million worth of art he bought between 2016 and 2020.

Around this same time Helfer contacted the IRS arguing that a series of deductions Pacheco had claimed in a number of revised tax returns newly submitted for past years in fact brought his total debt down to $1.8 million according to the source close to Pacheco. But the IRS never told Helfer or Pacheco if they had accepted his claims and wouldn’t confirm things one way or the other.

In the summer of 2022 Hochman Pacheco’s attorney met with the IRS and federal prosecutors the affidavit states. Nearly two years later the case still remains unresolved. Prosecutors this past week filed for an extension of time to search Pacheco’s AOL email account for further evidence backing up their allegations.

In the meanwhile Pacheco is only getting deeper and deeper into the hole.

“As of June 29 2023” the affidavit states “Pacheco’s personal liability to the IRS for tax year 2014 was $7833967.46.”"

The Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts (FHR) program is a popular benefit that many with the Amex Platinum like taking advantage of. In this post I wanted to take a closer look at the program including how to maximize it — while FHR can add value for cardmembers it’s not quite as invaluable for luxury hotel stays as many assume.

What is Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts?

The Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts program offers elite-like perks when staying at 1200+ luxury hotels around the globe. This includes all kinds of luxury hotels from independent properties to Ritz-Carltons Park Hyatts Waldorf Astorias etc. You simply have to book an FHR rate through American Express at an eligible property and you’ll receive several additional perks ranging from free breakfast to a room upgrade to a hotel credit.

A few things to note about the Amex FHR program:

The Amex FHR program is available to those with The Platinum Card® from American Express (review) and The Business Platinum Card® from American Express (review)

You can search Amex FHR rates and find eligible hotels through this link on the Amex website

In order to take advantage of Amex FHR benefits you need to book an eligible rate which is typically equivalent to the best flexible rate offered through the hotel; you can’t get FHR perks on most special rates being offered directly by hotels whether it’s a members only rate AAA rate pre-paid rate etc.

To use Amex FHR you need to pay for your hotel stay with an American Express card though it doesn’t have to be the Amex Platinum; you could potentially maximize points by using a different card if you’d like

What perks does Amex FHR offer?

When booking through Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts you receive the following additional benefits:

Daily breakfast for two — this could be a full or continental breakfast depending on the property

A room upgrade — this is available upon arrival subject to availability and while it’s typically a one category upgrade you’ll sometimes do better than that

A $100 experience credit once per stay — this could be a $100 food & beverage credit a $100 spa credit a $100 property credit or a free lunch for two as it very much varies by property

12PM check-in subject to availability — since this is subject to availability I wouldn’t value this too highly since most hotels will let you check-in at noon if a room is open

Guaranteed 4PM check-out — this is a valuable benefit as you’re guaranteed 4PM check-out when booking through Amex FHR

Complimentary Wi-Fi — most hotels offer complimentary Wi-Fi nowadays anyway so I don’t value that too highly

As you can see the benefits here really adds up. Amex claims that the FHR program offers an average of $550 of value per stay though obviously that can sometimes be significantly more and sometimes it can be significantly less.

How do you make an Amex FHR booking?

The process of making an Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts booking is pretty straightforward. Just go to the American Express Travel website and log into your account associated with an Amex Platinum.

Then do a search for a hotel — you could just search a city or you can search a specific hotel name. For example let’s look at hotels in Hamburg Germany.

On the next page you’ll see a bunch of hotels listed. Since this is the Amex Travel website you’ll see dozens of hotels listed but look for the ones that have “Fine Hotels & Resorts” written next to them. You can also filter by this on the left side of the page.

When you click a specific hotel you can review the amenities and specifically what the “unique” $100 amenity is at a hotel (in this case it’s just a $100 property credit which gives you the most flexibility).

Then you can compare rates by room type and select your preferred room.

And then you can choose if you want to pay right away to earn 5x points or want to pay when you get to the hotel (more on that below).

As you can see this is usually a pretty straightforward process though sometimes I find the Amex Travel website can be a bit wonky and requires you to call to make a booking.

How do you maximize value with Amex FHR?

While the above are the basics of how the Amex FHR program works I figured I’d talk a bit about some of the other tricks that you can use to maximize value with the program since the above is only the beginning.

Earn 5x points on Amex FHR bookings

When you make your Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts booking you can earn 5x Membership Rewards points with the Amex Personal Platinum Card or Amex Business Platinum Card. There’s one major catch — you have to pay for your entire hotel stay upfront. Note that even though you’re pre-paying the stay still has the same cancelation policy it would usually have so that doesn’t mean you 100% have to make the stay or lose all your money.

For many people the full prepayment requirement could be a challenge or not be worth the trouble especially if you’re booking an expensive trip a year in advance. However it is an option to be aware of.

Note that if you’re not going to pre-pay for your hotel stay and earn 5x points I’d recommend using a different Amex card at the hotel to settle your bill. While you have to pay with an Amex when using Amex FHR you don’t have to pay with the Amex Platinum. For example you could instead pay with the Amex Green Card which offers 3x points on travel purchases (including hotels).

You can earn 5x points on Amex FHR stays

Use your $200 Amex Platinum hotel credit

New as of 2021 the Amex Personal Platinum Card offers a $200 hotel credit every calendar year. The way this works just book a prepaid hotel through Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts or The Hotel Collection (two-night minimum stay required) using American Express Travel and you’ll receive an annual credit of up to $200. There is no

You could use this perk in a single stay so this will essentially knock $200 off the cost of your first booking each year.

Earn hotel points for your Amex FHR bookings

If you’re staying at a luxury hotel that belongs to a major hotel loyalty program (like an InterContinental St. Regis etc.) note that Amex FHR bookings are eligible for earning points and elite nights in your preferred program. You can get even more value from these stays by racking up points and potentially stacking elite perks.

You can still receive elite perks on Amex FHR bookings

Take advantage of Amex FHR free night offers

In addition to all the perks offered through Amex FHR the program also sometimes has a free night offer at a hotel. This could come in the form of a third fourth or fifth night free offer. If this is available you’ll typically see it listed directly when doing a search.

Alternatively you can browse Amex FHR free night offers here.

Don’t pay for your Amex FHR booking with points

American Express has the Pay With Points feature whereby you can redeem points towards a variety of purchases. You can use Amex Membership Rewards points to pay for Fine Hotels & Resorts bookings at the rate of one cent per point (which is at least better than the redemption value for other hotels). That means you could book a $300 hotel for 30000 Membership Rewards points.

However personally this isn’t how I would choose to redeem Amex points. I value Membership Rewards points at 1.7 cents each and that’s thanks to the ability to transfer points to partners. If you have the right card you can even get more value by using the Pay With Points feature for flights which would be my preference.

There are better ways to redeem Amex points than FHR

Make short stays to get the most value

You can often get the most value through Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts by booking short stays. Why? One of the amenities is a roughly $100 credit that you get once per stay. If you’re staying for just one night the value of that is significant since it’s like a $100 credit for one day. Meanwhile if you’re staying for a week that credit is spread out over a lot more days.

So in the past I have been known to do some hotel hopping so that I had shorter stays giving me more credits.

Maximize $100 credits by hotel hopping

What is Amex’s The Hotel Collection?

Since this can cause confusion I think it’s briefly worth talking about The Hotel Collection which is another Amex program that offers perks at hotels. This is available at over 600 hotels and think of it as a slightly lower end version of Fine Hotels & Resorts.

The Hotel Collection is valid on stays of two or more nights and offers a $100 hotel credit plus a room upgrade subject to availability. As you can see it’s not quite as generous as Fine Hotels & Resorts but then again you’ll also find less expensive hotels belonging to this collection.

The program is worth being aware of but you’ll never have to decide between Fine Hotels & Resorts and The Hotel Collection for a given hotel stay since each hotel only participates in one or the other.

Why Amex FHR isn’t actually that valuable

The Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts program can offer a lot of value for your hotel stays. That being said there are lots of other programs available through travel advisors that offer similar (or sometimes even better) perks without the need to have a specific credit card. There’s a lot of overlap in terms of the hotels and benefits.

Just to give some examples:

How do you decide whether to book through Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts or one of these programs? The one material advantage of FHR is guaranteed 4PM check-out which none of the above programs offer (some programs offer late check-out subject to availability but not guaranteed).

That being said there are quite a few benefits to booking through these programs over Amex FHR:

Generally a hotel group wants you to book directly through its “own” program and incentivizes it accordingly

For example groups like Four Seasons and Hyatt will prioritize upgrades for those booking through their own program over those booking through a third party program like Amex FHR or Virtuoso

The individual hotel programs also sometimes have better promotions — sometimes they may offer bonus points for bookings sometimes they allow other non-flexible rates to be combined with these perks sometimes they have more participating hotels etc.

The execution of certain benefits may be better through a hotel group’s own program as well — for example when booking through Four Seasons Preferred Partner you also have the option of enjoying room service breakfast rather than just being able to dine in the restaurant

You don’t need a specific credit card to take advantage of any of these programs and for that matter you can pay for your stay with any credit card potentially allowing you to better maximize points

So I usually end up booking through the individual programs and don’t use Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts. That being said I certainly use it when I have a short stay and value 4PM late check-out and I’ll also use it going forward at least once per year to get value out of my $200 annual Amex Platinum hotel credit.

Upgrades may be better through a hotel’s own program

Bottom line

The Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts program is a great option for those with the Amex Platinum Card to enhance their stays at luxury hotels. FHR offers elite-like perks without any sort of loyalty and these benefits could include breakfast room upgrades hotel credits and more. Best of all with the new $200 hotel credit on the Amex Platinum Card you can stack these great perks with savings.

While the program can come in handy I wouldn’t really view this as a major reason to get an Amex card. That’s because very similar — and in some cases better — offers are available through other hotel programs available through travel advisors which don’t require having a certain credit card.

In addition ADQ has also purchased shares of other shareholders which include both pension funds and private investors but it was the holding company Mandólín hf. which owned about 70% of the shares in the hotel.

The following is reported on the website of Stefnir but mbl.is has previously reported about ADQ’s interest in the hotel. According to Morgunbladid discussions have been ongoing for the sale of the holding for about six months. The purchase price is not stated on the website.

Carpenter & Co. which has been a partner of Mandolin in the project will retain its stake in the company as stated on the company’s website Stefnir and there will be no changes to the operations of Reykjavík Edition which will continue to be operated by Marriott International.

Sixteen hotels under the name of Edition

The sale is also stated to be in accordance with the vision of SÍA III that the hotel would attract the interest of long-term foreign investors who see an opportunity to participate in further advancement of the local tourist industry.

The Marriott Edition opened in the fall of 2021 and is one of the most spectacular hotels in the country. Construction on the hotel took longer than originally planned and proved to be costly partly because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Reykjavík hotel is not the first hotel to be bought by the Abu Dhabi National Trust however as another fund Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has bought Marriott Edition Hotels in Florida New York and London. The Marriott Hotels chain operates several brands under its brand name while the Edition Hotels – along with the W-Hotels – are what can be called high-end hotels that focus on rare tourists. Only 16 hotels are operated under the Edition brand with the opening of three more planned in the coming years.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhhcnBlcnNiYXphYXIuaW4vdHJhdmVsLWZvb2Qvc3RvcnkvYS1zdHVubmluZy13YXktdG8tc2F5LWktZG8tNTY0OTY0LTIwMjMtMDEtMDHSAV9odHRwczovL3d3dy5oYXJwZXJzYmF6YWFyLmluL2FtcC90cmF2ZWwtZm9vZC9zdG9yeS9hLXN0dW5uaW5nLXdheS10by1zYXktaS1kby01NjQ5NjQtMjAyMy0wMS0wMQ?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,A stunning way to say ‘I do’,"When luxury fashion influencer Sonam Babani tied the knot with her beau Neil Sanghvi earlier this year it was against the majestic backdrop of the Matterhorn in Zermatt Switzerland surrounded only by a clutch of close family members. The two-day affair in the Swiss Alps was a magical winter wonderland experience with ski sessions on freshly-powdered slopes gourmet Swiss cuisine and staying at a luxury ski chalet. The elegant wedding mandap was set up at a height of 2222 metres framed by glistening white views and the Matterhorn.

“We were originally set to get married in Bodrum Turkey with a big fat celebration hosting 400-500 guests but that soon changed when the pandemic hit” says Babani. “When my wedding was postponed I was sure of one thing. It had to have the perfect backdrop.” The couple chose Switzerland for their love for skiing and its picturesque landscapes lending itself to a truly ‘gram-worthy’ wedding.

Like Babani’s nuptials a large number of weddings have undergone a paradigm shift. Venues are bespoke; the destinations are becoming more glamorous and it’s all about capturing perfect moments for the gram.

According to WedMeGood’s annual wedding industry report the average wedding guest size this year was reported to be 270 guests which is a 40% increase from the guest size last year of 180 guests. However a quarter of weddings this year were still intimate weddings—under 100 people the report points out. It’s telling that the choice of venues and destinations is in keeping with not just the aesthetic of the couple but also the need for intimate bespoke locations for one’s nuptials and giving guests a great experience.

According to Tina Tharwani co-founder Shaadi Squad a Mumbai-based luxury wedding planning company weddings are also no longer customary conventional events. “People want to provide an experiential celebration. They want to delve deeper into a location’s heritage history the food culture people and the hospitality.” For instance we executed a wedding at Wildflower Hall an Oberoi Resort Shimla for a guest list of about 150. We planned a bonfire night a picnic brunch the next day and organised a wedding movie screening on the last day. Given this guest size it was possible for us to incorporate such personal elements into the wedding and include every single person in the celebrations whether in a big way or small she notes.

Destination weddings are on the rise

As Indian wedding celebrations become more intimate destination weddings have seen quite the increase. According to WedMeGood’s report nearly 18% of weddings this year were destination weddings with places such as Jaipur Udaipur and Goa topping the list. Internationally Thailand Dubai and Bali were the top three choices with Turkey and Azerbaijan adding to the mix in 2022.

Devanshi Parekh founder Shreem Events a Mumbai-based bespoke wedding and event planning company points out that when it comes to scouting for venues hotel ballrooms and lawns are not the only locations couples want to utilise. “For instance at Westin Goa we saw the hotel lobby be used for the mandap for that particular wedding and at the Grand Hyatt Mumbai the fountain made for an ideal backdrop for the mandap” she says adding that they are always on a lookout for locations offering multiple uses. This could include a stunning terrace spa or even a sundowner location for the mehendi as it is no longer limited to being a traditional day function by the poolside.

She adds that for this wedding season all of the nuptials they planned were confined to properties with 110 to 150 rooms. “However families are still spending the same amount of money as they would have done pre-pandemic but with fewer guests as they want to give each one a very personalised experience rather than just inviting guests for the sake of formality.”

At the Leela Palace Udaipur an 80-key property located on the banks of Lake Pichola the number of weddings has increased compared to a few years ago. “Traditionally we would do about 10-12 weddings a year. This number has now gone up to 20-22 weddings a year” says Nishant Agarwal general manager The Leela Palace Udaipur. A smaller-sized wedding also makes it easier for the hotel to deliver luxurious personalised experiences for the family and their guests be it an intimate sit-down dinner butler service or curating wedding favours he offers. For the calendar year ending December 2022 the property expects 35% of its revenues to come from weddings and has about 8 weddings lined up over the next quarter.

In Kochi Kerala Chittoor Kottaram tucked away on the backwaters is a single-key mansion that used to be the abode of the erstwhile Rajah of Cochin. It has now been converted into a luxury heritage property managed by hotel chain CGH Earth. “Given its unique history and location the mansion has been a popular pick for intimate celebrations. Most of the weddings here are limited to a guest list of about 100” says Mridula Jose vice president Marketing CGH Earth. She adds that as a wedding destination it appeals to an interesting mix of people—primarily chosen by couples from mixed cultures both Indian and international. “Many of them live abroad and like to give their foreign guests a unique visual and gastronomical experience.”

Khushnooma Kapadia area director of marketing South Asia at Marriott International Inc points out that to a trend that’s taken shape over the last year or so. Families really want to invest in personal experiences for their guests rather than large ostentatious displays she says. “After a lull in travel couples and their families want to go all out with their wedding celebrations and exotic offbeat locations are topping the list.”

Kapadia says that some of the Marriott properties which have done well for them as wedding venues have been across destinations such as Mussoorie Goa Hyderabad and Kochi apart from major cities like Mumbai and Delhi. We’re exploring markets like Coorg Indore and Shillong as upcoming wedding destinations she offers. Their wedding-related IP Shaadi by Marriott Bonvoy also helps curate bespoke and innovative offerings for celebrations. This could range from arranging for a helipad to have guests flown in to ensuring plant-based wedding menus and even getting one’s own maharaj into the hotel’s kitchens to prepare certain dishes for an event.

Make it for the gram

Most importantly though social media is also dictating how weddings are being perceived. Wedding Social co-founded by duo Natasha Kothari and Anam Batliwalla is a social media strategy firm that helps create a digital time capsule for newlyweds be it creating trending reels wedding content strategy and real-time updates from the wedding. Here location and the venue play a crucial role.

“A set-up with the perfect golden hour lighting scenic views and luxe accents is essential for a wedding to stand out on Instagram” offers Batliwalla. We’ve noticed a trend where the teams managing digital and social content for the weddings have been involved in venue planning from the get-go. Couples are also opting for international and offbeat destinations so that their photos are not repetitive compared to other weddings. Not just destinations like Bali or Thailand but locations in Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam she says.

Batliwalla shares an example of a recent wedding they covered in Jaipur where the bride demanded a picture-perfect sunset-hued vermala moment in a garden. “This is the perfection the bride wanted on her wedding day and in creating these memories social media and the venue has quite the role to play.

When it comes to boutique weddings Tharwani says that some popular destination picks internationally are Istanbul Bahrain Italy Jordan and Bali while locally Shimla Dehradun Mashobra Mussoorie and Tirthan Valley are being explored for smaller intimate gatherings complementing the idea of the new-age Indian wedding."

With this development customers of the bank are required to obtain dollar cards for international transactions.

In a statement to its customers the bank said customers would not be able to make international transactions on Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) and Point of Sales (PoS) using their naira Mastercards.

“We write to inform you that you will no longer be able to use your naira Mastercards for international online and PoS transactions effective December 31 2022.

“Kindly note that you can use your GTBank dollar card for international spending requirements.”

According to the bank its dollar card allows a daily $1000 or an equivalent in the local currency transaction adding that there would be no withdrawal limit on “annual spend and PoS transactions” for the dollar cards.

Earlier in September First Bank announced the suspension of international transactions on its naira Mastercards and visa prepaid naira cards.

It stated: “Due to current market realities on foreign exchange you will no longer be able to use the Naira Mastercard Naira Credit Card our Virtual card and Visa Prepaid Naira card for international transactions.

This will take effect on September 2022.

In July Standard Chartered Bank also suspended international transactions on its naira visa debit card. Flutterwave Eversend and other fintech platforms had also stopped virtual card services for international transactions.

A SIMPLE IRA plan allows employees to make elective salary-deferral contributions to an individual retirement account (IRA) expressed as a percentage of compensation up to $15500 per year for 2023 (Secs. 408(p)(2)(A)(i) (ii) and (E); Notice 2022-55). Compensation includes amounts that must be reported by the employer on Form W-2 Wage and Tax Statement plus any elective contributions from the employee. SIMPLE IRA plans may allow individuals who have attained at least age 50 by the calendar year end to make additional catch-up contributions (Sec. 414(v)(5)(A)). For 2023 the maximum allowable catch-up contribution is $3500 (Sec. 414(v) (2)(B)(ii); Notice 2022-55).

Each employee who receives at least $5000 in compensation from the employer during any two prior years and who is reasonably expected to earn at least $5000 in the current year must be eligible to participate in the SIMPLE IRA plan (Sec. 408(p) (4)(A)). Self-employed individuals are treated as employees for this purpose. Also leased employees are required to be included if they meet the salary requirements (Sec. 414(n)). Each eligible employee may elect during the 60-day period before the beginning of any year to make elective salary-deferral contributions under the SIMPLE IRA plan for such year and to modify any previous elections (Sec. 408(p)(5)(C)). Employees must be allowed to stop making elective contributions at any time during the year. The plan may provide that employees who do so cannot resume them until the beginning of the next year.

Making mandatory employer contributions under a SIMPLE IRA

The employer is required to make payments to each employee’s SIMPLE IRA under one of the following formulas:

Matching contribution formula: The employer generally is required to match each employee’s elective contributions dollar for dollar up to 3% of the employee’s compensation (Sec. 408(p)(2)(A)(iii)). A special rule allows the employer in no more than two out of any five years to elect a lower rate (but not less than 1%) for all employees. The employer must notify employees of the intended match rate within a reasonable time before the 60-day election period for the year.

Nonelective contribution formula: The employer is required to make a contribution equal to 2% of compensation on behalf of each eligible employee (regardless of the employee’s salary-deferral contribution if any). For this purpose compensation of each eligible employee is limited to $330000 for 2023 (Sec. 401(a)(17); Notice 2022-55) thus limiting the contribution to $6600 per employee ($330000 × 2%). The employer must notify eligible employees of its intention to use this formula within a reasonable time before the 60-day election period for the year (Sec. 408(p)(2)(B)(i)).

Planning tip: In some cases a matching contribution can be less expensive for the employer than a nonelective contribution. For example an employer that has numerous employees who are eligible to participate in its SIMPLE IRA plan but has experienced a low participation rate in prior years will contribute less using the matching formula. If the employer’s principal goal is to maximize contributions to key employees a matching contribution is also a better choice regardless of participation rates by lower-paid employees because more can be contributed to the targeted participants.

No other contributions can be made to the SIMPLE IRA plan. Employers must make their matching contributions by the due date (including extensions) of the tax return for the year to which the contributions relate.

Contributions to a SIMPLE IRA plan are deductible by the employer and excluded from the employee’s income (Secs. 402(k) and 404(m)). An employee’s elective salary-deferral contributions are wages for Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) tax purposes but employer matching contributions are not. Both employee and employer contributions are fully vested when made.

Dealing with administrative requirements for SIMPLE IRAs

An employer maintaining a SIMPLE IRA plan is not required to file an annual Form 5500 Annual Return/Report of Employee Benefit Plan with the IRS or the U.S. Department of Labor. The employer must indicate on Forms W-2 that eligible employees are participants in the plan and indicate the amount of their elective salary-deferral contributions (Sec. 408(l)(2)(A)). The employer is permitted to designate a SIMPLE IRA plan trustee who is required to (1) provide the employer with a summary description of the plan; (2) provide an account statement to each employee who has a SIMPLE IRA; and (3) file Form 5498 IRA Contribution Information with the IRS (Secs. 408(i) and (l)(2)(B)).

An employer must notify each employee eligible to participate of the procedures for electing to participate in the plan. This notification must be made before the 60th day before the beginning of the year. An employee who first becomes eligible must be notified within a reasonable time before the 60th day before the first day the employee is eligible to participate (Sec. 401(k)(11) (B) (iii)(II)).

Employers may establish a SIMPLE IRA plan with various financial institutions mutual fund sponsors or insurance companies. SIMPLE IRA plans must operate on a calendar year with a 60-day enrollment period before the beginning of the year. An existing employer may set up a SIMPLE IRA plan between Jan. 1 and Oct. 1 if it did not previously have a SIMPLE IRA plan. If the employer previously maintained a SIMPLE IRA plan a new plan can only be effective on Jan. 1. A new employer that comes into existence after Oct. 1 of the year the SIMPLE IRA plan is established may establish a SIMPLE IRA plan as soon as administratively feasible after starting the business (Notice 98-4).

The IRS provides two model forms for employers to use to set up a SIMPLE IRA plan: Form 5304-SIMPLE Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees of Small Employers (SIMPLE) — Not for Use With a Designated Financial Institution and Form 5305-SIMPLE Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees of Small Employers (SIMPLE) — for Use With a Designated Financial Institution. An employer should use Form 5304-SIMPLE if it allows each plan participant to select the financial institution for receiving the participant’s SIMPLE IRA plan contributions. An employer should use Form 5305-SIMPLE if it will deposit all SIMPLE IRA plan contributions at an employer-designated financial institution. The IRS provides substantial guidance for establishing a SIMPLE IRA plan in Notice 98-4 (see also IRS.gov webpage SIMPLE IRA Plan).

Example. Using a SIMPLE IRA plan to maximize benefits for owners: F Inc. is a calendar-year C corporation owned equally by A and B. Besides the two shareholder-employees F has three other employees. F normally has low net earnings and is unable to pay a large amount into a retirement plan or be obligated to make a substantial contribution to the plan. The owners have considered adopting a simplified employee pension (SEP) plan but they want to contribute a higher percentage of their own salaries than that contributed for the other three employees.

F can adopt a SIMPLE IRA plan. Under the plan employees can elect to make salary-deferral contributions of up to $14000 for 2022 and $15500 for 2023 (before considering allowable catch-up contributions for employees aged 50 and over). F must either (1) match each employee’s contribution up to 3% of the employee’s compensation or (2) make a contribution equal to 2% of each eligible employee’s compensation (regardless of whether the employee made any salary-deferral contribution).

The table “SIMPLE IRA with 3% Matching Contributions” (below) shows the results if F adopts a SIMPLE IRA plan for 2022 (exclusive of catch-up contributions). It assumes the company chooses to make 3% matching contributions (which would maximize contributions for the two shareholder-employees) and that two of the three other employees contribute the amounts shown.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy51ZWZhLmNvbS91ZWZhY2hhbXBpb25zbGVhZ3VlL25ld3MvMDI0MC0wZTkzNWNkZmUwZTMtNzJiM2M1Y2RlMzgwLTEwMDAtLWJpZ2dlc3QtY2hhbXBpb25zLWxlYWd1ZS13aW5zLWxpdmVycG9vbC04LTAtYmVzaWt0YXMtcmVhbC1tL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Biggest Champions League wins: Liverpool 8-0 Beşiktaş Real Madrid 8-0 Malmö,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMijwFodHRwczovL3d3dy51ZWZhLmNvbS91ZWZhY2hhbXBpb25zbGVhZ3VlL25ld3MvMDI0MC0wZTkzNWNkZmUwZTMtNzJiM2M1Y2RlMzgwLTEwMDAtLWJpZ2dlc3QtY2hhbXBpb25zLWxlYWd1ZS13aW5zLWxpdmVycG9vbC04LTAtYmVzaWt0YXMtcmVhbC1tL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2EBDDE0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

BBL to be trimmed down to 43 games from 2024-25 season

by Cricbuzz Staff • Last updated on

The BBL last saw a 43-game season in 2017-18. © Getty

The Big Bash League will be trimmed down to 43 games 18 less than the current length from the 2024-25 season. The revamp is part of a new seven-year domestic broadcast deal struck by Cricket Australia with Foxtel Group and Seven West Media.

CA said BBL content was reduced in the new deal to allow for ""increased player availability greater proportion of prime-time matches and stronger alignment with school holidays.""

BBL was last played in the 43-game (incl three post-league matches) format in the 2017-18 season and has since expanded to 61 games including a finals series featuring five matches. The length of the tournament has come for criticism given that the best Australian players representing the national team seldom played in the home-grown T20 league.

The ongoing season of the league which will see the participation of both David Warner (Sydney Thunder) and Steve Smith (Sydney Sixers) post the completion of the New Year's Test will lose a lot of overseas talents to the SA20 and ILT20 leagues. It is something the league hopes to avoid with the change in the future seasons.

Seven-year broadcast deal worth AUD 1.5 billion

The new broadcast deal which will run from mid 2024 till the end of the 2030-31 season has been signed for a value of AUD 1.5 billion. Seven and Foxtel paid AUD 1.18 billion in 2018 for the current six-year deal wresting the rights from the Nine Network which held them for more than 40 years.

However Seven and CA had been at loggerheads over content since 2020 with the broadcaster threatening to pull out of the ongoing contract and filing proceedings at the Federal Court of Australia in June. As part of this contract extension now running until 2031 Seven has also agreed to end legal action against CA over a perceived lack of quality in the BBL the country's domestic T20 tournament.

Seven said on Tuesday it would pay AUD 65 million a year in the new deal a 13% reduction on the current one and would save more than AUD 50 million in cash over the term from reduced fees and production costs.

As he did for Troy Fautanu and several other Pittsburgh Steelers newcomers Wilson made a quick phone call to fourth-round pick Mason McCormick welcoming him to the team.

“Russell Wilson Facetimed me as soon as I got drafted” McCormick said via Erie’s JET24 News. “That was pretty cool. A lot of the vets have reached out.”

Wilson did the same or at least attempted to with Troy Fautanu who missed his initial call on his flight to Pittsburgh. The two eventually got in touch. Wilson was clearly plugged into the Steelers’ selections even on the third day of the draft rookies that aren’t always expected to make an immediate impact. McCormick was the team’s fourth-round selection and third offensive lineman selected. Primarily a guard throughout his college career he’s tabbed to begin the year as a backup behind starters Isaac Seumalo James Daniels and veteran swingman Nate Herbig.

Still offensive line depth can quickly be tested in the league. All it would take is an interior injury or two to press Mason McCormick into action to protect someone like Wilson. While he has the challenge of coming from the FCS level McCormick’s size and elite experience of nearly 60 starts will help him make the transition to the NFL level.

With one of the youngest offenses in football last year the Steelers are looking for leadership. It’s one reason why they pursued Wilson in the offseason and why he’s the front-runner to start the year ahead of Justin Fields. At 35 years old with a Super Bowl ring Wilson is regarded as a hard-worker who wants to lead and rally the group.

Beyond leadership the unit needs to be more productive an offense that’s flailed and sputtered three seasons running. Talent and skill will be the main reasons why Pittsburgh succeeds or fails but having a tight-knit team where everyone is included from starting quarterback to fourth-round guard is often a hidden factor in how to maximize a group.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtbmV3cy8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM5MzYvc3RlZWxlcnMtc2lnbi1yb29raWVzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtY29udHJhY3QtdGVybXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Steelers officially sign rookies Mason McCormick Logan Lee,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.behindthesteelcurtain.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /pittsburgh-steelers-news/2024/5/10/24153936/steelers-sign-rookies-mason-mccormick-logan-lee-contract-terms (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2881E10>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMikAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWhpbmR0aGVzdGVlbGN1cnRhaW4uY29tL3BpdHRzYnVyZ2gtc3RlZWxlcnMtbmV3cy8yMDI0LzUvMTAvMjQxNTM5MzYvc3RlZWxlcnMtc2lnbi1yb29raWVzLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1sb2dhbi1sZWUtY29udHJhY3QtdGVybXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiggFodHRwczovL3d3dy5ka3BpdHRzYnVyZ2hzcG9ydHMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDUvMTAvbG9nYW4tbGVlLW1hc29uLW1jY29ybWljay1zaWduLXRoZWlyLXJvb2tpZS1jb250cmFjdHMtd2l0aC10aGUtc3RlZWxlcnMtbmZsLW5ld3MtY2Rj0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Logan Lee Mason McCormick sign their rookie contracts with the Steelers,

Meaning: If you use these links to buy something we will not earn a commission.

When McDonald's quietly reintroduced its bagel sandwiches this year people were thrilled that the beloved breakfast items had returned.

Why? I noticed after looking around at fast-food chains' menus that the bagel sandwich is somewhat of a rare find. Burger King and Wendy's have croissant and biscuit sandwiches but of the big three only McDonald's has a bagel sandwich. Panera and Dunkin'—both spots that regularly carry bagels—naturally had them too. How would McDonald's stack up against these two bakery-coffee chains?

To test the quality of the McDonald's bagel sandwiches I pitted its Sausage Egg & Cheese Bagel against the same sandwiches from Dunkin' and Panera. Plus since people all over rave about McDonald's Steak Egg & Cheese–which seems to be a truly unique 'wich—I snuck that one in for comparison too. Here's which one is worth the stomach space next to your cup of coffee.

Dunkin's Sausage Egg & Cheese Bagel

1 sandwich : 680 calories 34 g fat (12 g saturated fat) 1500mg sodium 68 g carbs (5 g fiber 8 g sugar) 26 g protein

The look: Dunkin' does bagels so one could reasonably assume it could construct a sausage egg and cheese bagel sandwich well too. But of the three bagel sandwiches Dunkin's came in last. It looked inviting with egg and sausage about the same size and stretching throughout the bagel. But an early warning sign came from the size of the bagel: it just looked oddly compact next to the other ones. Also when cut the cheese was almost non-existent.

The taste: The bagel was very firm and slightly chewy but overall dry. The small amount of cheese didn't help and the sausage was the driest and least spicy of the three sandwiches. One taster did prefer the Dunkin' sandwich over the Panera sandwich calling it ""chewy and delicious"" and ""firm and sweet."" The sausage had a good texture but lacked the spices of the other two.

We Tasted 4 Hot Chocolates From Fast-Food Chains & the Winner Was a Major Upset

Panera's Sausage Egg & Cheese Bagel

1 sandwich : 790 calories 48 g fat (18 g saturated fat) 1230mg sodium 61 g carbs (2 g fiber 5 g sugar) 30 g protein

The look: Full disclosure the Asiago bagel had run out so the Panera sandwich had to be made with a sesame bagel. The egg on the sandwich was a little uneven and the sausage was far too small for the sandwich resulting in an uneven bite.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

The taste: The Panera bagel sandwich suffered from the same thing Panera's hot chocolate suffered from in the hot chocolate taste test: just too much of everything. Honestly we were lucky that the Asiago bagel was not available because with the garlic aioli that was spread on it the fat was already over the top. (The sandwich has 110 calories and about 10 grams of fat more than the others on the list.)

The sandwich tasted good without a doubt but it was good for a few bites and then became too greasy. One taster preferred the Panera sandwich over the Dunkin' sandwich because it had spicy sausage with a ""mouth-filling flavor"" and very creamy cheese. The sausage was spicier but all agreed that the aioli was just too much.

McDonald's Sauage Egg & Cheese Bagel

1 sandwich : 680 calories 39 g fat (16 g saturated fat) 1320mg sodium 53 g carbs (4 g fiber 7 g sugar) 27 g protein

The look: McDonald's sausage egg and cheese crossection provided a hint at what was to come. The chain sure can build a sandwich. The fluffy egg and sausage both stretched across the sandwich and the creamy cheese on both sides provided the tasty glue. Even when cut in half the sandwich held steady.

The taste: The bagel had a smooth soft texture that was easy to bite through next came the layers of creamy cheese that added moisture to the bagel on both sides. One taster even remarked that the cheese had a subtle sweetness to it. The sausage was spicy but mild—one called it ""memorable""—and the fluffy egg had a nice buttery flavor. Overall this is the one that all of the tasters would get again.

Bonus: McDonald's Steak Egg & Cheese Bagel

1 sandwich : 680 calories 35 g fat (15 g saturated fat) 1500mg sodium 57 g carbs (3 g fiber 7 g sugar) 34 g protein

The look: Fans were overjoyed when this beloved sandwich hit select McDonald's stores again. The bagel sandwich is made with a unique ""steak patty"" fluffy scrambled egg and American cheese and doesn't seem to be copied at any other fast food restaurant.

We wanted to try the sandwich to what all the fuss was about. The sandwich is identical to the sausage offering with a steak patty instead of a sausage patty. It has the same double layer of cheese and scrambled egg.

The taste: You might be wondering what separates a steak patty from a hamburger patty and the answer in the case of McDonald's steak is spices. The hamburger patty is pure beef the steak patty has spices and some flavorings. The texture is also different a bit looser and it does work for the bagel sandwich. The loosely packed steak patty made the bagel softer the cheese cheesier and the egg fluffier. The sandwich was filling with a delicious savory flavor. It technically won the taste test up against the other sandwiches.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RidXNpbmVzc25ld3MubmV0L2FydGljbGVzLzIzMTM0LW1jZG9uYWxkcy1kb3VibGVzLWRvd24tb24tcmVzdGF1cmFudC1kZXZlbG9wbWVudNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,McDonald's doubles down on restaurant development,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2RidXNpbmVzc25ld3MubmV0L2FydGljbGVzLzIzMTM0LW1jZG9uYWxkcy1kb3VibGVzLWRvd24tb24tcmVzdGF1cmFudC1kZXZlbG9wbWVudNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2E08F40>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

If you are looking for a tasty and quick egg sandwich for breakfast you can easily whip one up at home. Or you could run out to the nearest fast food place and pick up one. Of course not all restaurants use real eggs and you're even less likely to get real eggs at a fast food chain. There are chains like Panera Wendy's and McDonald's that claim to use only real eggs but do they really?

According to TODAY Burger King uses a ""liquid egg-pasteurized mixture"" for their ""eggs"" made up of whole eggs water xanthan gum and more ingredients that aren't eggs. Simple Most claims that Chick-fil-A also uses a similar mixture for their eggs as does Subway. The outlet notes that Jack-In-The-Box and Starbucks actually do use real eggs for most of their egg items. But yo might be wondering what about McDonald's?

The PASCAL Precision Transcatheter Valve Repair System is used to repair the mitral valve of the heart without the need for open-heart surgery. The device system includes a permanent implant and a delivery system. The primary components of the implant are constructed from nitinol (a nickel titanium alloy) and covered in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) cloth.

The PASCAL Precision Transcatheter Valve Repair System implant is inserted using a tube-like device called a delivery catheter through the largest vein (femoral vein) in the groin area and guided through the blood vessel to the left side of the heart. The permanent implant looks and functions like a clip. Once in the heart the clip is used to grasp the two tissue flaps (leaflets) of the mitral valve in the heart which is the valve that controls blood flow between the top and bottom chambers of the heart’s left side. The implant clips the two flaps together to reduce the backflow of blood through the valve (mitral regurgitation). After the clip is in place it is disconnected from the delivery catheter and then the delivery catheter is removed from the body.

The PASCAL Precision Transcatheter Valve Repair System is intended to be used to treat patients with significant (a grade greater than or equal to 3+) mitral regurgitation caused by abnormal mitral valve leaflets and/or the area around the leaflets when open-heart surgery is considered too risky.

The PASCAL Precision Transcatheter Valve Repair System is intended to reduce the amount of blood that moves in the wrong direction through the mitral valve. As a result the patient may have:

fewer hospitalizations

improved quality of life

relief of symptoms such as tiredness or fatigue

improved ability to exercise

A clinical study compared the results of 117 patients treated with the PASCAL Precision Transcatheter Valve Repair System with of 63 patients who were treated with a commercially available similar device. The study showed that the two devices had similar low risks for major complications at 30 days post-implant and reduction in the amount of blood flowing back through the valve (lowering mitral regurgitation grade to less than or equal to 2+) at 6 months post-implant.

The PASCAL Precision system should not be used in patients who:

Cannot tolerate certain blood thinners during or after the procedure

Have an untreatable allergy to nickel titanium or X-ray contrast media

Have an active infection of the mitral valve (endocarditis)

Have mitral regurgitation caused by rheumatic disease

Have evidence of blood clots in the heart or veins leading to the heart

Problem is there is an ongoing global shortage of BCG.

Now the California biotech has partnered with the Serum Institute of India in an exclusive deal to manufacture BCG globally.

The arrangement aims to create “a long-term solution to chronic BCG supply shortage issues” and produce BCG “at large scale” for use in combination with Anktiva in non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) ImmunityBio said Thursday.

BCG originally developed as a tuberculosis vaccine is also a standard treatment for NMIBC which accounts for about 80% of around 80000 new bladder cancer diagnoses each year in the U.S.

The FDA has cleared Anktiva and BCG to treat patients with BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with carcinoma in situ. And ImmunityBio is evaluating the combo in BCG-unresponsive NMIBC with papillary tumors and perhaps more importantly in BCG-naïve NMIBC.

In the current indication ImmunityBio will go toe to toe with Merck & Co.’s PD-1 megablockbuster Keytruda and Ferring Pharmaceuticals’ gene therapy Adstiladrin both of which are administered by themselves without BCG. Ironically Merck is currently the sole supplier of BCG in the U.S.

Merck’s TICE BCG has been the lone BCG product in the U.S. since 2012 coming after Sanofi and another drugmaker ran into manufacturing problems. Sanofi officially pulled out of the market in 2016. Merck which had before then not been the major supplier globally for BCG was forced to pick up the slack.

In October 2020 Merck announced a plan to construct a new TICE BCG manufacturing facility in North Carolina. But that project was anticipated to be completed by late 2025 to late 2026 according to a Merck update in January this year. Once operational Merck expects to triple its current BCG capacity and believes believes it will be able to meet demand “for the foreseeable future.”

Merck has been rationing BCG supply since 2019. The New Jersey Big Pharma allocates its limited supply to distributors and wholesalers based on historical purchasing and it doesn’t directly determine the supply to individual healthcare providers.

SII is the largest manufacturer of BCG vaccine globally according to ImmunityBio. The Indian company has two BCG products for oncology use one traditional BCG called Onco-BCG is already commercialized outside the U.S. The new deal will see SII immediately supply that standard BCG for ImmunityBio’s clinical trials once the FDA signs off on the trial protocols which ImmunityBio plans to submit to global regulatory authorities within 30 days.

The second product a recombinant BCG is undergoing midstage testing in Europe. This version includes two gene modifications to improve its profile and according to ImmunityBio it has shown “potent immunogenicity with CD8+ and CD4+ stimulation and improved safety compared to standard BCG.” The two partners are now working to speed up the phase 2 program.

However in both cases the timeline for commercial supplies remains unclear. ImmunityBio will have more clarity on the timeline once it submits the trial protocols to the FDA a media aide to the company told Fierce Pharma.

The good news for ImmunityBio? Anktiva’s current U.S. label doesn’t specify or limit the type of BCG the drug can be used with. This allows the company to explore other alternatives to Merck’s TICE BCG ImmunityBio’s executive chairman Patrick Soon-Shiong M.D. said during an investor call last week.

“We are pleased to partner with the Serum Institute of India so that the power of its large-scale world-class GMP manufacturing capacity can be used to address the issue of BCG shortage which affects thousands of bladder cancer patients annually” Soon-Shiong said in a statement Thursday.

Financial details and the exact terms of the deal were not disclosed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiP2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tLzIwMjQvMDQvMjUvbWVyY2stbXJrLWVhcm5pbmdzLXExLTIwMjQuaHRtbNIBQ2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNuYmMuY29tL2FtcC8yMDI0LzA0LzI1L21lcmNrLW1yay1lYXJuaW5ncy1xMS0yMDI0Lmh0bWw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Merck beats earnings expectations raises outlook on strong Keytruda and vaccine sales,"The exterior view of the entrance to Merck headquarters in Rahway New Jersey on Feb. 5 2024.

Merck on Thursday reported first-quarter revenue and adjusted earnings that topped expectations as it posted strong sales of its blockbuster cancer drug Keytruda and vaccine products.

The pharmaceutical giant also raised and narrowed its full-year revenue and adjusted earnings forecasts. Merck now expects 2024 sales to come in between $63.1 billion and $64.3 billion up from previous guidance of $62.7 to $64.2 billion.

The company expects full-year adjusted earnings of $8.53 to $8.65 per share up from its prior forecast of $8.44 to $8.59 per share.

That outlook includes a one-time charge of roughly 26 cents per share related to Merck's acquisition of Harpoon Therapeutics in January. The company develops immune-based cancer drugs. The guidance also includes a negative impact of 30 cents per share from foreign exchange changes.

Shares of Merck rose 4% on Thursday following the results.

Here is what Merck reported for the first quarter compared with what Wall Street was expecting based on a survey of analysts by LSEG:

Earnings per share: $2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected

$2.07 adjusted vs. $1.88 expected Revenue: $15.78 billion vs. $15.20 billion expected

The company posted a net income of $4.76 billion or $1.87 per share for the first quarter. That compares with a net income of $2.82 billion or $1.11 per share during the year-earlier period.

Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs Merck earned $2.07 per share for the first quarter. Both adjusted and nonadjusted profit for the period include the charge related to the Harpoon deal.

Merck raked in $15.78 billion in revenue for the quarter up 9% from the same period a year ago.

Those results come as Merck shows substantial progress in preparing for Keytruda's patent expiration in 2028. The loss of exclusive rights to the drug will likely cause sales to fall forcing the company to draw revenue from elsewhere.

But Merck has a handful of new deals under its belt and key drug launches that will help it offset those losses. That includes Winrevair a medication approved in the U.S. last month to treat a progressive and life-threatening lung condition. Some analysts expect that worldwide sales of Winrevair could reach $5 billion by 2030.

Merck is seeing ""high interest"" in Winrevair from patient groups and a range of prescribers and is making ""good progress"" in enabling access to the drug Chief Financial Officer Caroline Litchfield said during an earnings call Thursday. Several payers have already established coverage policies for the drug she noted.

World of Hyatt does a great job with its partnerships which potentially give members a lot more ways to both earn and redeem points. For example Hyatt has partnerships with Small Luxury Hotels of the World Lindblad Expeditions American Airlines and others.

I’d argue World of Hyatt’s most valuable partnership is with MGM Rewards in Las Vegas. This partnership dates back to 2013 — not only was this the first hotel loyalty collaboration of its kind in Las Vegas but to this day I still find it to be the best. MGM’s loyalty program has been rebranded as of February 2022 so I wanted to take an updated look at how the partnership works.

World of Hyatt members get perks at MGM hotels

World of Hyatt and MGM Rewards have a phenomenal collaboration that allows World of Hyatt members to earn and redeem points for over a dozen additional hotels in Las Vegas. Not only that but there are status matching opportunities so that you can get even more value for your hotel stays.

Let’s look at the details of how this works — what hotels participate how can you earn and redeem points and what are status benefits like?

Which MGM hotels participate in the Hyatt partnership?

The following MGM properties in Las Vegas participate in the Hyatt partnership allowing you to earn and redeem points:

ARIA

Bellagio

Delano

Excalibur

Luxor

Mandalay Bay

MGM Grand

Monte Carlo

New York New York

NoMad

Park MGM

The Mirage

The Signature at MGM Grand

Vdara

NoMad Las Vegas

Earn World of Hyatt points at MGM properties

The World of Hyatt points earning rates at MGM properties are excellent and match what you’d earn when staying at a Hyatt property:

There are a few other things to be aware of if trying to earn World of Hyatt points at MGM properties:

In order to earn points you need to book either directly through MGM or through Hyatt; third-party bookings (including through Amex Fine Hotels & Resorts) generally aren’t eligible to earn points

At check-in inform the front desk agent of your desire to earn World of Hyatt points and provide both your World of Hyatt and MGM Rewards numbers (yes you need to provide both though membership in both programs is free and easy)

While the World of Hyatt Credit Card (review) and World of Hyatt Business Credit Card (review) offer 4x World of Hyatt points for Hyatt stays this doesn’t extend to MGM properties so you’ll want to use another card for your hotel spending

You can also earn World of Hyatt points for spending on incidentals at MGM properties up to $5000 per stay; if you’re staying at an MGM property you can generally charge incidentals to your room from any participating MGM property which is a great way to rack up more World of Hyatt points

Luxor Las Vegas

Redeem World of Hyatt points at MGM properties

You can redeem World of Hyatt points and free night certificates for stays at MGM properties. Each hotel falls into one of Hyatt’s standard award tiers which are as follows (this includes peak and off-peak award pricing which kicks in for stays as of March 2022):

All MGM properties are somewhere between Category 3 (typically 12000 points per night) and Category 6 (typically 25000 points per night).

Personally I value World of Hyatt points at 1.5 cents each so I’d always recommend comparing cash costs and points costs when redeeming because it may not always represent a good deal. This is especially true for midweek stays when hotel rates in Las Vegas are often quite low.

There are a few more things to be aware of if redeeming World of Hyatt points for MGM stays:

While World of Hyatt waives resort fees for all members when redeeming points at Hyatt properties this doesn’t apply when redeeming points at MGM properties (as I’ll discuss below you can potentially get waived resort fees on paid stays though)

You can’t redeem points for suites or premium rooms at MGM properties and also can’t use confirmed suite upgrade awards to secure a suite upgrade

Some blackout dates do apply for award redemptions unlike for stays at Hyatt hotels

Mandalay Bay & Delano Las Vegas

Earn World of Hyatt elite nights at MGM properties

Regardless of whether you’re paying cash or redeeming points World of Hyatt members can earn elite nights for MGM stays where their World of Hyatt account is linked. Elite nights earned this way count toward status and also toward the Milestone Rewards program.

MGM Grand Las Vegas

Get a status match with MGM Rewards

World of Hyatt members can status match to MGM Rewards so that they can receive extra perks for stays at MGM properties. Here’s how status maps over between programs:

World of Hyatt members receive MGM Rewards Sapphire membership

World of Hyatt Discoverist members receive MGM Rewards Pearl status

World of Hyatt Explorist & Globalist members receive MGM Rewards Gold status

World of Hyatt members can match status as often as they’d like — you need to reapply at the end of the membership year but that’s an easy enough process.

You can request an MGM Rewards status match here and can read about MGM Rewards elite benefits here.

These elite perks are in lieu of the standard World of Hyatt elite perks you’d receive since MGM Rewards perks are what’s recognized at MGM properties. In terms of benefits don’t get too excited here. For example perks for MGM Rewards Gold members include the following:

Access to a priority check-in queue

Room upgrades subject to availability excluding suites

Priority reservations for restaurants and entertainment

Room discounts

Waived resort fees

Bellagio Las Vegas

Get waived resort fees at MGM properties

I wanted to specifically highlight what I consider to be the most exciting MGM Rewards Gold perk which is waived resort fees. Resort fees are one of the most annoying practices in the hotel industry as they’re essentially an add-on junk fee.

The great thing is that MGM Rewards Gold members and above including those who earned the status through a World of Hyatt status match (Explorist and Globalist members) receive waived resort fees. This is an awesome opportunity since some MGM properties in Las Vegas cost under $30 per night without the resort fee.

The resort fees do still show during the booking process though it’s my understanding that they should be removed once on property. Since the new program just went live I haven’t seen any data points yet on how exactly that works in practice.

Bottom line

The collaboration between Hyatt and MGM in Las Vegas remains the most comprehensive hotel partnership of its kind that we’ve seen on the Strip. World of Hyatt members can earn and redeem points at similar rates to Hyatt stays and there are also some reciprocal elite perks. Most exciting of all MGM Rewards Gold members and above no longer have to pay resort fees.

Historically when I’ve gone to Las Vegas this collaboration has made me choose to always stay at MGM properties. In fairness it has been a few years and Las Vegas is one place I particularly don’t have much interest in returning to in this era.

Have you ever leveraged the Hyatt & MGM partnership in Las Vegas? If so what was your experience like?",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8va3R1bC5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb24td29ybGQvcG9ydGlvbi1vZi1sYW5kLXNvbGQtd2hlcmUtbGFzLXZlZ2FzLTIwMTctbXVzaWMtZmVzdGl2YWwtbWFzcy1zaG9vdGluZy10b29rLXBsYWNl0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly9rdHVsLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9uYXRpb24td29ybGQvcG9ydGlvbi1vZi1sYW5kLXNvbGQtd2hlcmUtbGFzLXZlZ2FzLTIwMTctbXVzaWMtZmVzdGl2YWwtbWFzcy1zaG9vdGluZy10b29rLXBsYWNl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Portion of land sold where Las Vegas 2017 music festival mass shooting took place,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8va3R1bC5jb20vbmV3cy9uYXRpb24td29ybGQvcG9ydGlvbi1vZi1sYW5kLXNvbGQtd2hlcmUtbGFzLXZlZ2FzLTIwMTctbXVzaWMtZmVzdGl2YWwtbWFzcy1zaG9vdGluZy10b29rLXBsYWNl0gF4aHR0cHM6Ly9rdHVsLmNvbS9hbXAvbmV3cy9uYXRpb24td29ybGQvcG9ydGlvbi1vZi1sYW5kLXNvbGQtd2hlcmUtbGFzLXZlZ2FzLTIwMTctbXVzaWMtZmVzdGl2YWwtbWFzcy1zaG9vdGluZy10b29rLXBsYWNl?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3E7DBA0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The competition between the U.S and China becomes intense for the chip. Semiconductor is an integral part of the electronic and military industry. What are causes behind this war what is the current situation what will be the implications in the future and who will win this war is going to be discussed in this article.

Semiconductors also known as chips are the materials that have a conductivity between conductors and insulators. The semiconductors can be consisted of pure elements such as germanium or silicon. Semiconductors use in electronic equipments and devices including diodes transistors integrated circuits consumer products like mobile phones laptops game consoles microwaves cars. Now it is considered as “The new oil” and ” A 21st century horse shoe nail.” Moreover semiconductors is the core component in the manufacturing industries. The U.S.A Asian countries like Taiwan China South Korea and Japan are the largest semiconductor producers in the world. Taiwan China South Korea’s companies account for 87% of the global market. Supply chain uncertainty Covid-19 pandemic the increasing demand of consumers that lead to the world in semiconductor war. Especially the COVID-19 pandemic played a massive and dimension role in this crisis. Industries were failed to meet the supply and demand of the consumer in that climate semiconductors companies were lagged behind and unstable to cope with the severe demand pressure from various sectors. According to the semiconductor Industry Association the global semiconductor sales were hoped to be maximized by 20% in 2021. As demand for consumer electronics decreased the paucity of advanced elements waned rapidly. Hence the industry is now dealing with intense stock. The automotive chip insufficiency is now struggling to protect the unwavering supplies of chips. In 2022 they were predicted to rise 9%. The declining of semiconductors production will help to lead the production process of the electronic industries in 2023. By the end of the 2027 silicon market is expected to reach USD70 billion and annual growth rate of 5.1% over the next five years.

The United States of America is the semiconductors race leader in the worldwide market whose market share value was at over $200 billion in 2020. They are also a harbinger in the export of semiconductors 50% of the world market.Basically semiconductors are the top export goods of the United States of America and they invest more than one-fifth of the sales on research and advancement second only the pharmaceutical business. America still depends on Taiwan for exporting semiconductors. On the other hand China is now an emerging major participant in the semiconductor race. Its semiconductor industry has been expanding since 2015. The Semiconductor Industry Association hopes China to excel Taiwan by 2030 with a 24% market share and supported by its ” Made in China 2025″ initiative. China has already devoured Taiwan in the semiconductor business during the previous two years. America always wants to halt China but China’s semiconductor industry continuous to advance at the 9% its annual sales might reach $114 billion by 2024. In order to Taiwan’s geopolitical kismet precarious both America and China are racing to make their own malignance as well as self-contained in the semiconductor industry. China works for long to catch up America’s advanced technologies and competes in microchip. The rise of techno-nationalism in china will lead to both the competition and conflict with the U.S.

The U.S has recently passed the CHIPS Act that involve Impressive financial support for science and technology because their main goal is to maintain a magnificent competitive benefits over China. The most panorama controls on chip imitation the U.S Department of commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) implements. On October 2022 the Biden Administration amplified its controls on the exports of semiconductors associated inputs and equipments to China. On December 6 Biden visited the site of Taiwan semiconductor Manufacturing Co. new plant in Arizona and called a potential project for the U.S chip supply chain.In mid December The U.S administration included 36 additional Chinese chip makers from entrancing U.S chip technology including YMTC. Not only 40Billion investment delineates the U.S endeavors to attain hegemon over China in chip industry but also America has stepped to strength entrance to flourished semiconductors technology by Chinese companies. It is now crystalline that America has announced a semiconductor war on China.

Now it is a question of trillion dollars who will win the chip war? Chip war is now a war more than the geopolitical conflict. It is very difficult to determine the winner of the chip war. As the U.S is the global hegemon some countries will try to make a coalition with the U.S and its allies. The U.S will dominate the semiconductors technology for artificial intelligence and military installation. China takes the conduct in microelectronics like cloud computing and electronic devices. According to some Economists there will be no winner only losers will remain.

Investors at the stock market have not had the best of times in 2022. There is a strong possibility of a recession in the United States economy in early 2023 and the IMF predicts global growth will slow to 2.7% this year the weakest pace since 2001 as GDP growth is projected to be only 1%. A tight labor market and rising wages will likely remain a key concern for businesses in the coming months.

It is projected that the Fed will likely continue to raise interest rates in 2023. According to recent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) research it has been projected that core PCE inflation in 2023 will be 3.5%. The central bank will likely raise interest rates by at least another 0.5 percentage points by March 2023 to reach its goal. Various high-ranking Fed officials have recently signaled that they would like to maintain a restrictive monetary policy stance throughout 2023.

However the investor exodus from the stock market has also created buying opportunities. As one of the oldest and best-performing investment vehicles in the United States - the benchmark indexes have rarely delivered back-to-back negative returns in consecutive years - investors are excited about the possibility of earnings season offsetting some of the blowback from rising rates. The possibility of peak inflation and a continued downward trend in prices has also boosted investor interest in the market.

Some of the top stocks that could benefit from this recovery momentum include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) and The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Retail investors who have become an important market force in recent years are also likely to make a strong comeback at the market in light of easing concerns around inflation. Investments in high-growth stocks are thus projected to rise up exponentially in the coming months.

“Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a leader in the production of DRAM and NAND memory. We invested in the stock in the third quarter of 2019 during a cyclical downturn in the memory industry. Our rationale was that while the memory industry is cyclical we believed there are strong secular drivers in place that will lead to higher peaks and long-term growth. Our secular thesis is based on our conviction that the quest for ever-increasing compute speeds will increasingly rely on memory to solve bottlenecks and that increased memory content in nearly everything from mobile phones to automobiles will drive demand. Micron’s stock traded lower during the quarter due to macroeconomic concerns that led to lower earnings expectations. We increased our stake in the company as we believe our secular thesis remains intact. We wanted to take advantage of what we view as temporary cyclical concerns that caused the stock to trade at less than 10x reasonable trough earnings per share (EPS) estimates and less than 7x recent peak EPS.”

In its Q2 2022 investor letter Bireme Capital an asset management firm highlighted a few stocks and GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:

“Amazingly GameStop Corp. (NYSE:GME) is one of our only short positions to not fall in 2022. The stock trades at an $11.5b market cap exceeding its pre-pandemic peak by billions of dollars. This is even though revenue is down 30% from the peak gross margins are down 1500 bps and the company has generated a negative free cash outflow of $700m in the last four quarters (we had to double-check that number because it is so high). Wall Street has consistently revised downward their estimates of Gamestop’s profitability making its stock price stability in 2022 even more perplexing. Analysts currently estimate an EBITDA loss of around $400m markedly worse than their estimates as of 2/3/22 of a loss of $60m. Their recently launched NFT marketplace will do nothing to fix their core business and comes about a year too late to be relevant in the NFT space. Instead we see this as another example of a meme stock company hoping it can ape its way into a new business model utilizing the popularity of the stock to drive new lines of business. We are not optimistic and think the $11.5b market cap drastically overestimates the capability of Gamestop to pivot into something more profitable. We find it unlikely that Gamestop books a GAAP profit ever again.”

The CHIPS and Science Act signed into law in August represents a massive investment in U.S. domestic manufacturing. The act aims to drastically expand the U.S. semiconductor industry strengthen supply chains and invest in R&D for new technological breakthroughs. According to John Hart professor of mechanical engineering and director of the Laboratory for Manufacturing and Productivity at MIT the CHIPS Act is just the latest example of significantly increased interest in manufacturing in recent years.



“You have multiple forces working together: reflections from the pandemic’s impact on supply chains the geopolitical situation around the world and the urgency and importance of sustainability” says Hart. “This has now aligned incentives among government industry and the investment community to accelerate innovation in manufacturing and industrial technology.”



Hand-in-hand with this increased focus on manufacturing is a need to prioritize sustainability.



Roughly one-quarter of greenhouse gas emissions came from industry and manufacturing in 2020. Factories and plants can also deplete local water reserves and generate vast amounts of waste some of which can be toxic.



To address these issues and drive the transition to a low-carbon economy new products and industrial processes must be developed alongside sustainable manufacturing technologies. Hart sees mechanical engineers as playing a crucial role in this transition.



“Mechanical engineers can uniquely solve critical problems that require next-generation hardware technologies and know how to bring their solutions to scale” says Hart.



Several fast-growing companies founded by faculty and alumni from MIT’s Department of Mechanical Engineering offer solutions for manufacturing’s environmental problem paving the path for a more sustainable future.



Gradiant: Cleantech water solutions



Manufacturing requires water and lots of it. A medium-sized semiconductor fabrication plant uses upward of 10 million gallons of water a day. In a world increasingly plagued by droughts this dependence on water poses a major challenge.



Gradiant offers a solution to this water problem. Co-founded by Anurag Bajpayee SM ’08 PhD ’12 and Prakash Govindan PhD ’12 the company is a pioneer in sustainable — or “cleantech” — water projects.



As doctoral students in the Rohsenow Kendall Heat Transfer Laboratory Bajpayee and Govindan shared a pragmatism and penchant for action. They both worked on desalination research — Bajpayee with Professor Gang Chen and Govindan with Professor John Lienhard.



Inspired by a childhood spent during a severe drought in Chennai India Govindan developed for his PhD a humidification-dehumidification technology that mimicked natural rainfall cycles. It was with this piece of technology which they named Carrier Gas Extraction (CGE) that the duo founded Gradiant in 2013.



The key to CGE lies in a proprietary algorithm that accounts for variability in the quality and quantity in wastewater feed. At the heart of the algorithm is a nondimensional number which Govindan proposes one day be called the “Lienhard Number” after his doctoral advisor.



“When the water quality varies in the system our technology automatically sends a signal to motors within the plant to adjust the flow rates to bring back the nondimensional number to a value of one. Once it’s brought back to a value of one you’re running in optimal condition” explains Govindan who serves as chief operating officer of Gradiant.



This system can treat and clean the wastewater produced by a manufacturing plant for reuse ultimately conserving millions of gallons of water each year.



As the company has grown the Gradiant team has added new technologies to their arsenal including Selective Contaminant Extraction a cost-efficient method that removes only specific contaminants and a brine-concentration method called Counter-Flow Reverse Osmosis. They now offer a full technology stack of water and wastewater treatment solutions to clients in industries including pharmaceuticals energy mining food and beverage and the ever-growing semiconductor industry.



“We are an end-to-end water solutions provider. We have a portfolio of proprietary technologies and will pick and choose from our ‘quiver’ depending on a customer’s needs” says Bajpayee who serves as CEO of Gradiant. “Customers look at us as their water partner. We can take care of their water problem end-to-end so they can focus on their core business.”



Gradiant has seen explosive growth over the past decade. With 450 water and wastewater treatment plants built to date they treat the equivalent of 5 million households’ worth of water each day. Recent acquisitions saw their total employees rise to above 500.



The diversity of Gradiant’s solutions is reflected in their clients who include Pfizer AB InBev and Coca-Cola. They also count semiconductor giants like Micron Technology GlobalFoundries Intel and TSMC among their customers.



“Over the last few years we have really developed our capabilities and reputation serving semiconductor wastewater and semiconductor ultrapure water” says Bajpayee.



Semiconductor manufacturers require ultrapure water for fabrication. Unlike drinking water which has a total dissolved solids range in the parts per million water used to manufacture microchips has a range in the parts per billion or quadrillion.



Currently the average recycling rate at semiconductor fabrication plants — or fabs — in Singapore is only 43 percent. Using Gradiant’s technologies these fabs can recycle 98-99 percent of the 10 million gallons of water they require daily. This reused water is pure enough to be put back into the manufacturing process.



“What we’ve done is eliminated the discharge of this contaminated water and nearly eliminated the dependence of the semiconductor fab on the public water supply” adds Bajpayee.



With new regulations being introduced pressure is increasing for fabs to improve their water use making sustainability even more important to brand owners and their stakeholders.



As the domestic semiconductor industry expands in light of the CHIPS and Science Act Gradiant sees an opportunity to bring their semiconductor water treatment technologies to more factories in the United States.



Via Separations: Efficient chemical filtration



Like Bajpayee and Govindan Shreya Dave ’09 SM ’12 PhD ’16 focused on desalination for her doctoral thesis. Under the guidance of her advisor Jeffrey Grossman professor of materials science and engineering Dave built a membrane that could enable more efficient and cheaper desalination.



A thorough cost and market analysis brought Dave to the conclusion that the desalination membrane she developed would not make it to commercialization.



“The current technologies are just really good at what they do. They’re low-cost mass produced and they worked. There was no room in the market for our technology” says Dave.



Shortly after defending her thesis she read a commentary article in the journal Nature that changed everything. The article outlined a problem. Chemical separations that are central to many manufacturing processes require a huge amount of energy. Industry needed more efficient and cheaper membranes. Dave thought she might have a solution.



After determining there was an economic opportunity Dave Grossman and Brent Keller PhD ’16 founded Via Separations in 2017. Shortly thereafter they were chosen as one of the first companies to receive funding from MIT’s venture firm The Engine.



Currently industrial filtration is done by heating chemicals at very high temperatures to separate compounds. Dave likens it to making pasta by boiling all of the water off until it evaporates and all you are left with is the pasta noodles. In manufacturing this method of chemical separation is extremely energy-intensive and inefficient.



Via Separations has created the chemical equivalent of a “pasta strainer.” Rather than using heat to separate their membranes “strain” chemical compounds. This method of chemical filtration uses 90 percent less energy than standard methods.



While most membranes are made of polymers Via Separations’ membranes are made with graphene oxide which can withstand high temperatures and harsh conditions. The membrane is calibrated to the customer’s needs by altering the pore size and tuning the surface chemistry.



Currently Dave and her team are focusing on the pulp and paper industry as their beachhead market. They have developed a system that makes the recovery of a substance known as “black liquor” more energy efficient.



“When tree becomes paper only one-third of the biomass is used for the paper. Currently the most valuable use for the remaining two-thirds not needed for paper is to take it from a pretty dilute stream to a pretty concentrated stream using evaporators by boiling off the water” says Dave.



This black liquor is then burned. Most of the resulting energy is used to power the filtration process.



“This closed-loop system accounts for an enormous amount of energy consumption in the U.S. We can make that process 84 percent more efficient by putting the ‘pasta strainer’ in front of the boiler” adds Dave.



VulcanForms: Additive manufacturing at industrial scale



The first semester John Hart taught at MIT was a fruitful one. He taught a course on 3D printing broadly known as additive manufacturing (AM). While it wasn’t his main research focus at the time he found the topic fascinating. So did many of the students in the class including Martin Feldmann MEng ’14.



After graduating with his MEng in advanced manufacturing Feldmann joined Hart’s research group full time. There they bonded over their shared interest in AM. They saw an opportunity to innovate with an established metal AM technology known as laser powder bed fusion and came up with a concept to realize metal AM at an industrial scale.



The pair co-founded VulcanForms in 2015.



“We have developed a machine architecture for metal AM that can build parts with exceptional quality and productivity” says Hart. “And we have integrated our machines in a fully digital production system combining AM postprocessing and precision machining.”



Unlike other companies that sell 3D printers for others to produce parts VulcanForms makes and sells parts for their customers using their fleet of industrial machines. VulcanForms has grown to nearly 400 employees. Last year the team opened their first production factory known as “VulcanOne” in Devens Massachusetts.



The quality and precision with which VulcanForms produces parts is critical for products like medical implants heat exchangers and aircraft engines. Their machines can print layers of metal thinner than a human hair.



“We’re producing components that are difficult or in some cases impossible to manufacture otherwise” adds Hart who sits on the company’s board of directors.



The technologies developed at VulcanForms may help lead to a more sustainable way to manufacture parts and products both directly through the additive process and indirectly through more efficient agile supply chains.



One way that VulcanForms and AM in general promotes sustainability is through material savings.



Many of the materials VulcanForms uses such as titanium alloys require a great deal of energy to produce. When titanium parts are 3D-printed substantially less of the material is used than in a traditional machining process. This material efficiency is where Hart sees AM making a large impact in terms of energy savings.



Hart also points out that AM can accelerate innovation in clean energy technologies ranging from more efficient jet engines to future fusion reactors.



“Companies seeking to de-risk and scale clean energy technologies require know-how and access to advanced manufacturing capability and industrial additive manufacturing is transformative in this regard” Hart adds.



LiquiGlide: Reducing waste by removing friction



There is an unlikely culprit when it comes to waste in manufacturing and consumer products: friction. Kripa Varanasi professor of mechanical engineering and the team at LiquiGlide are on a mission to create a frictionless future and substantially reduce waste in the process.



Founded in 2012 by Varanasi and alum David Smith SM ’11 LiquiGlide designs custom coatings that enable liquids to “glide” on surfaces. Every last drop of a product can be used whether it’s being squeezed out of a tube of toothpaste or drained from a 500-liter tank at a manufacturing plant. Making containers frictionless substantially minimizes wasted product and eliminates the need to clean a container before recycling or reusing.



Since launching the company has found great success in consumer products. Customer Colgate utilized LiquiGlide’s technologies in the design of the Colgate Elixir toothpaste bottle which has been honored with several industry awards for design. In a collaboration with world- renowned designer Yves Béhar LiquiGlide is applying their technology to beauty and personal care product packaging. Meanwhile the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted them a Device Master Filing opening up opportunities for the technology to be used in medical devices drug delivery and biopharmaceuticals.



In 2016 the company developed a system to make manufacturing containers frictionless. Called CleanTanX the technology is used to treat the surfaces of tanks funnels and hoppers preventing materials from sticking to the side. The system can reduce material waste by up to 99 percent.



“This could really change the game. It saves wasted product reduces wastewater generated from cleaning tanks and can help make the manufacturing process zero-waste” says Varanasi who serves as chair at LiquiGlide.



LiquiGlide works by creating a coating made of a textured solid and liquid lubricant on the container surface. When applied to a container the lubricant remains infused within the texture. Capillary forces stabilize and allow the liquid to spread on the surface creating a continuously lubricated surface that any viscous material can slide right down. The company uses a thermodynamic algorithm to determine the combinations of safe solids and liquids depending on the product whether it’s toothpaste or paint.



The company has built a robotic spraying system that can treat large vats and tanks at manufacturing plants on site. In addition to saving companies millions of dollars in wasted product LiquiGlide drastically reduces the amount of water needed to regularly clean these containers which normally have product stuck to the sides.



“Normally when you empty everything out of a tank you still have residue that needs to be cleaned with a tremendous amount of water. In agrochemicals for example there are strict regulations about how to deal with the resulting wastewater which is toxic. All of that can be eliminated with LiquiGlide” says Varanasi.



While the closure of many manufacturing facilities early in the pandemic slowed down the rollout of CleanTanX pilots at plants things have picked up in recent months. As manufacturing ramps up both globally and domestically Varanasi sees a growing need for LiquiGlide’s technologies especially for liquids like semiconductor slurry.



Companies like Gradiant Via Separations VulcanForms and LiquiGlide demonstrate that an expansion in manufacturing industries does not need to come at a steep environmental cost. It is possible for manufacturing to be scaled up in a sustainable way.



“Manufacturing has always been the backbone of what we do as mechanical engineers. At MIT in particular there is always a drive to make manufacturing sustainable” says Evelyn Wang Ford Professor of Engineering and former head of the Department of Mechanical Engineering. “It’s amazing to see how startups that have an origin in our department are looking at every aspect of the manufacturing process and figuring out how to improve it for the health of our planet.”



As legislation like the CHIPS and Science Act fuels growth in manufacturing there will be an increased need for startups and companies that develop solutions to mitigate the environmental impact bringing us closer to a more sustainable future.

Operating Unit CTO Microsoft Federal

This year Kristen Summers is especially proud of how her team builds on Azure’s strong data and artificial intelligence capabilities to create solutions that enable customers to get more out of their data.

For example the company’s Federal Customer Success Unit has combined cognitive services into a capability that analyzes video in near real time providing an impressive range of information: recognizing faces identifying sentiment recognizing objects transcribing text from audio and automatically identifying and translating foreign language content as it occurs in the video. The result gives the viewer a comprehensive summary without having to wait.

“I love how our team collaborates with engineering for new capabilities that are focused on government needs and missions” Summers said. “For example we are collaborating on how to make sense of large unstructured collections of text and image material and through new approaches to combining and de-duplicating content across modalities we gain a fresh holistic understanding of the collection and its significance.”

Why Watch

As Summers’ team members look to the future they’re laser-focused on expanding how they help customers get the full value of all data. They’re excited about combining AI and analytics with collaboration tools for a seamless experience as customer teams work together to understand complex situations. The team is also focused on next-generation AI capabilities and using deep neural networks for large foundational models as well as trustworthy and responsible AI.

For example through its strong relationship with OpenAI the team is looking at how to apply OpenAI’s large language models to some of the biggest challenges government personnel are working to address. The Azure Responsible AI dashboard illustrates how the team is helping customers ensure the trustworthiness of their models built by data scientists as well as the ones the team provides them.

“Kristen’s government industry understanding and forward-thinking approach to bringing cloud and AI capabilities to bear on behalf of our customers’ toughest challenges is really unmatched” said John McNiff operating unit leader at Microsoft Federal. “Her thoughtful approach deep expertise and trust built over time are foundational to the success and collaboration she continues to drive – both with our extended team at Microsoft and among government and industry partners.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vaXRzZm9zcy5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0LXBsYW5uZXItYWx0ZXJuYXRpdmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Free and Open-Source Alternatives to Microsoft Planner,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiM2h0dHBzOi8vaXRzZm9zcy5jb20vbWljcm9zb2Z0LXBsYW5uZXItYWx0ZXJuYXRpdmVzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E4FEC700>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Instead all such plaintiffs seek monetary damages based on the sales of those products.”

Substantial patent litigation activity occurred in the mRNA space in 2022 involving nearly all of the major mRNA and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) pioneers. Since this is the most significant happening in this space with respect to IP in 2022 this post will provide an overview of that activity as well as a summary exposure analysis.

Summary of 2022 Litigation Activity

On February 28 lipid pioneer Arbutus and its exclusive licensee Genevant sued mRNA pioneer Moderna in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint contains allegations that Moderna infringed U.S. Patent Nos. 8058069 8492359 8822668 9364435 9504651 and 11141378 through inter alia Moderna’s sales of its Spikevax® vaccine product. The key patents-in-suit relate to four-lipid delivery systems designed to protect fragile mRNA “payloads” post-injection and release them once inside a recipient’s cells. Moderna moved to dismiss certain claims relating to Spikevax® made and sold to the U.S. government (the motion was based on 28 U.S.C. § 1498 which requires patent-holders to seek redress from the U.S. government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims whenever an invention covered its patent “is used or manufactured by or for the United States without a license”). The court denied the motion Moderna answered the complaint on November 30 and discovery has not yet commenced.

On March 17 lipid and SiRNA pioneer Alnylam sued Moderna and Pfizer separately in the District of Delaware. The respective complaints contain allegations that of Moderna and Pfizer each infringed U.S. Patent No. 11246933 by using Alnylam’s claimed cationic lipids in their vaccine products. On July 12 2022 Alnylam filed new separate suits against Moderna and Pfizer (and this time including Pfizer’s collaborator and mRNA pioneer BioNTech) also in the District of Delaware for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 11382979 which issued the same day the suit was filed and has claims directed to lipid nanoparticles and related methods of preparation. The March and July Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech cases were each separately consolidated and discovery has commenced in each case. Similar to the Arbutus case in the Alnylam v. Moderna case Moderna moved to dismiss certain claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1498 but the court has not ruled on that motion to date.

On March 18 a day after the initial Alnylam lawsuits were filed lipid pioneer Acuitas sued Arbutus and Genevant in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking a declaratory judgment that the BioNTech and Pfizer vaccine product Comirnaty® does not infringe the six Arbutus patents asserted in the Moderna case plus three other Arbutus-owned patents directed to LNPs (U.S. Patent Nos. 9006417 9404127 and 9518272) and that the subject Arbutus patents are invalid. Acuitas alleged that Comirnaty® contains “the lipids and lipid nanoparticles innovated by Acuitas” that are grounded in certain LNP-based collaborations between Acuitas and BioNTech and Pfizer. Since Acuitas has itself apparently not been accused of infringement and does not sell the Comirnaty® product one of the key early issues in this case is whether Acuitas has standing to sue. Arbutus and Genevant have moved to dismiss on these grounds; that motion is pending and discovery has not yet commenced.

Several months later on July 7 mRNA pioneer CureVac sued BioNTech (but not Pfizer) in the Regional Court of Düsseldorf Germany for infringement of one European Patent (EP1857122B1) and three German patents (DE202015009961U1 DE202021003575U1 and DE202015009974U1). CureVac has alleged that its patent portfolio “protects multiple inventions that are considered essential to the design and development of” Comirnaty® “including sequence modifications to increase stability and enhance protein expression as well as mRNA vaccine formulations specific to SARS CoV-2 vaccines.”

Within weeks of CureVac’s suit in Germany on July 25 BioNTech and Pfizer sued CureVac in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts for a declaratory judgment that the companies do not infringe CureVac’s U.S. Patent Nos. 11241493 (mRNA composition with certain lipid structures) 11135312 (method for producing a stabilized mRNA molecule) and 11149278 (method for treating/preventing infectious disease by administering a specific RNA molecule). Later around September Pfizer and BioNTech reportedly filed proceedings in the High Court of England and Wales seeking judgment that their COVID-19 vaccine does not infringe certain of CureVac’s European patents. In the U.S. case discovery has not yet commenced and CureVac has moved to dismiss or transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia which Pfizer and BioNTech oppose. That motion is pending.

Finally on August 26 Moderna sued Pfizer and BioNTech in the District of Massachusetts for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 10898574 (lipid nanoparticle and related method of producing a polypeptide) 10702600 (mRNA encoding a betacoronavirus S protein formulated in a lipid nanoparticle) and 10933127 (method of administering mRNA formulated in a lipid nanoparticle). Moderna indicated it also filed infringement lawsuits against Pfizer and BioNTech that same day in the Regional Court of Düsseldorf Germany. Moderna’s CEO Stéphane Bancel stated “[w]e are filing these lawsuits to protect the innovative mRNA technology platform that we pioneered invested billions of dollars in creating and patented during the decade preceding the COVID-19 pandemic.” In the U.S. case Pfizer and BioNTech answered the complaint on December 5 and discovery has not yet commenced.

Summary Exposure Analysis

Importantly none of the parties that have alleged infringement are seeking an injunction to stop the sales of Spikevax® or Comirnaty®. Instead all such plaintiffs seek monetary damages based on the sales of those products which will reportedly total over a combined $100 billion globally by the end of 2022.

Under 35 U.S.C. §284 a patent-holder may obtain damages “in no event less than a reasonable royalty” for the subject infringement. A patent-holder may also obtain compensatory damages in the form of “lost profits” in situations where it can prove (1) there is a demand for the patented product (2) the absence of acceptable non-infringing alternatives (3) it had the manufacturing and marketing capacity to exploit demand for the product and (4) the amount of profit it should have made but-for the accused product. Mentor Graphics Corp. v. EVE-USA Inc. 851 F.3d 1275 1284-85 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (reciting the Panduit factors).

With respect to the suits against Moderna none of Arbutus Genevant or Alnylam have alleged lost profit damages. That makes sense because it would be difficult for them do so (e.g. none sells products that compete with Spikevax®). Accordingly the potential exposure Moderna faces in the present cases is primarily at least a “reasonable royalty” applied against Spikevax® sales which may be enhanced if Arbutus and Genevant are successful in their willful infringement claims. See e.g. SRI Int’l. v. Cisco Sys. Inc. 14 F.4th 1323 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (stating that the showing of “deliberate or intentional infringement” could establish willful infringement and form the basis of enhanced damages).

Significantly not all Spikevax® sales may be implicated in the damages calculation since for example (1) the law surrounding the availability of reasonable royalty damages awards for infringement under 35 U.S.C. §271 based on extraterritorial sales is unclear and it is possible that some foreign sales may not apply to the subject damage calculation; and (2) Spikevax® sales made to the U.S. government may not be included in the damages calculation on the basis of 28 U.S.C. § 1498 (referenced above).

For similar reasons Pfizer and BioNTech are also subject to potential exposure from the Alnylam and CureVac suits in the form of reasonable royalties on sales of Comirnaty®. With respect to lost profits (1) Alnylam is similarly situated in the Pfizer/BioNTech case as in the Moderna case in that it does not sell competing products; and (2) while CureVac is an mRNA pioneer that has a deep pipeline it does not have a competing COVID-19 vaccine on the market to date and it would therefore not have a strong lost profits case in the U.S. courts. At this time Alnylam has not alleged willful infringement against Pfizer or BioNTech or for that matter Moderna. CureVac has not yet answered the Pfizer or BioNTech complaint in the District of Massachusetts and may have opportunity to claim willfulness in such a pleading if it has a basis to do so.

It is possible that Pfizer and BioNTech will also be sued by Arbutus and Genevant which according to the Acuitas complaint have already sent “demand” letters to Pfizer in 2020 and 2021. The declaratory judgment lawsuit filed by Acuitas may therefore have been a preemptive attack by the Pfizer partner and alleged developer of Comirnaty® LNPs. Perhaps if the Acuitas suit survives the pending motion to dismiss for lack of standing Arbutus and Genevant will add infringement counterclaims against Pfizer and BioNTech bringing them into that suit. Or if Arbutus and Genevant are successful with their motion to dismiss they may file a separate patent infringement lawsuit against Pfizer and BioNTech. It is also possible of course that no suit is filed against Pfizer or BioNTech and that the parties resolve any disputes without the need for litigation.

Returning to Moderna its suit against Pfizer and BioNTech is interesting for a number of reasons. First Moderna is seeking “compensatory damages including reasonable royalties and/or lost profit damages.” See e.g. Complaint ¶119 (emphasis added). Moderna is also seeking damages for willful infringement which could form the basis for enhanced damages. Id. at ¶118. Moderna has also stated that it “is not seeking damages related to Pfizer’s sales to AMC 92 [low- and middle-income countries] countries and is not seeking damages for Pfizer’s sales where the U.S. Government would be responsible for any damages. Consistent with Moderna’s patent pledge the Company is also not seeking damages for activities occurring before March 8 2022.” See also Complaint at Page 38 (Prayer for Relief).

Even with these potential limitations the fact that Moderna is seeking lost profits increases its leverage since a damages case based on lost profits could possibly amount to a significantly higher damages total than a total based solely on reasonable royalties (e.g. if Moderna can show large totals of sales of Spikevax® it should have made but for Pfizer’s sales of Comirnaty®). Accordingly filing this lawsuit and seeking significant damages accomplishes at least two major things for Moderna. First from an exposure management perspective it may serve to mitigate the damages exposure caused by the Alnylam and Arbutus cases. Second it applies even more pressure on Pfizer and BioNTech Moderna’s direct competitors in at least the COVID-19 vaccine space adding to the potential exposure those parties face under three major patent infringement lawsuits and potentially four should Arbutus and Genevant assert infringement claims also. Sometimes a competitor that is sued for patent infringement by another competitor will assert applicable patent infringement counterclaims from its own portfolio to increase exposure to the party that filed the lawsuit but that did not happen here. Neither BioNTech nor Pfizer have asserted any patent infringement counterclaims against Moderna to date.

By asserting their patents lipid pioneers Alnylam Arbutus and Genevant could gain (1) substantial damages awards based on royalties applied to massive vaccine sales should infringement be found; or (2) significant settlement revenues. These parties also run the risk of having their patents invalidated through the subject lawsuits or cancelled through IPR proceedings. This may not be as much of an issue for Alnylam which is asserting patent claims that it applied for and was granted after it was able to learn about the configuration of the Spikevax® and Comirnaty® vaccines (and therefore the subject patents may not be directly applicable to Alnylam’s commercial operation). However with respect to Arbutus and Genevant should one or more of the key Arbutus patents become invalidated in connection with the Moderna or Acuitas cases (or other cases Arbutus and Genevant may file) this would eliminate the ability for those entities to leverage licensing revenues under those patents going forward. Of course in their cases Moderna and CureVac also run the risk of having their asserted patents invalidated and the upside of those cases is the potential to obtain a favorable damages awards or settlements as well.

Expect More Litigation Activity

In 2022 nearly every major mRNA and lipid nanoparticle pioneer clashed in significant patent litigation activity. All of those cases related in some way to the sales of Spikevax® or Comirnaty® and related boosters—the only mRNA-based products generating revenue at this time. Moderna has potential exposure (in the form of reasonable royalty damages) from the lawsuits filed against it by Alnylam and Arbutus and Genevant while Pfizer and BioNTech have potential exposure from lawsuits filed by Alnylam CureVac and Moderna in the form of reasonable royalty damages (in the Moderna case lost profit damages also). These cases will likely persist through 2023 absent any settlements and other suits may be filed in the coming year as innovators assess their patent portfolios and assert patent rights against existing and future mRNA-based products approved for commercialization.

Technology used to produce the Covid vaccine has been shown to cut the risk of cancer tumours returning new research has shown.

Pharmaceutical firms Moderna and MSD are working on a personalised cancer vaccine designed to prime the immune system so the body can generate a response based on a person’s specific type of cancer tumour.

Experts from the Institute of Cancer Research in London (ICR) described the results as “exciting” and said such vaccines showed great potential in improving cancer treatment.

Moderna and MSD said the jab - mRNA-4157/V940 - when combined with the drug Keytruda led to a 44% reduction in the risk of cancer coming back or death compared to Keytruda alone in patients with stage three and four melanoma.

They said the results are the first demonstration of effectiveness of mRNA cancer treatment in a randomised clinical trial.

The firms will now approach regulators with the results and will launch a third-stage trial as well as rapidly expanding the drug to other types of cancer.

Stephane Bancel Moderna’s chief executive said: “Today’s results are highly encouraging for the field of cancer treatment.

“mRNA has been transformative for Covid-19 and now for the first time ever we have demonstrated the potential for it to have an impact on outcomes in a randomised clinical trial in melanoma.

“We will begin additional studies in melanoma and other forms of cancer with the goal of bringing truly individualised cancer treatments to patients.

“We look forward to publishing the full data set and sharing the results at an upcoming oncology medical conference as well as with health authorities.”

mRNA-4157/V940 is designed to stimulate an immune response using T cells based on the unique mutational make-up of a patient’s tumour.

Keytruda is an immunotherapy that works by increasing the ability of the body’s immune system to help detect and fight cancer cells.

Alan Melcher professor of translational immunotherapy at the Institute of Cancer Research London and honorary consultant oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust said: “There’s no question this is very exciting.

“These results show the feasibility of making and delivering personalised vaccines to treat cancer and that the vaccine can add benefit to current treatments.

“These results establish the principle that this complex technology is doable.

“However these are still early results and we have not seen the full data yet.

“The trial is relatively small and the benefits of vaccines against melanoma and potentially other cancers need to be further tested in larger trials and other cancer types.

“It will also be important to see if the vaccine did indeed generate an immune response against the tumour which I anticipate will be tested using tissue and blood samples collected from patients in this study.”

Dr Juanita Lopez clinical researcher at the ICR and consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden said: “This is the first time we’ve seen a personalised cancer vaccine together with standard of care immunotherapy reduce the chances of cancer coming back in patients with early stages of skin cancer.

“The findings are exciting and open the door for further trials in melanoma as well as other types of cancer.

“By leveraging the power of the immune system to specifically spot recognise and destroy cancer cells these personalised cancer vaccines hold great potential for improving cancer treatment outcomes.”",,,,,,,,,

Notching is the practice by credit rating agencies to give different credit ratings to the particular obligations or debts of a single issuing entity or closely related entities.

Rating distinctions among obligations are made based on differences in their security or priority of claim. With varying degrees of losses in the event of default obligations are subject to being notched higher or lower. Thus while company A may have an overall credit rating of ""AA"" its rating on its junior debt may be ""A.""

Key Takeaways Notching is when a credit rating agency bumps up or down the credit rating on an issuer's specific debts or obligations.

This is different than a credit agency upgrading or downgrading the company or issuer as a whole.

Because certain types of debt—for instance subordinated debts—are inherently riskier than senior debts the rating on junior debts can be notched lower.

Similarly those debts from the issuer that are senior and secured by collateral may be notched higher.

Debt notches are evaluated by comparing the individual credit ratings of two or more bonds.

How Notching Works

Companies are given credit scores by specialist credit rating agencies which evaluate a firm's creditworthiness and its ability to meet its debt payments and other obligations. However a company may also issue several types of debts (e.g. secured vs. unsecured) or related types of obligations (such as preferred shares or convertible bonds). As a result the credit rating on those particular debts or obligations may differ somewhat from the issuing company's overall credit rating due to unique risks or restrictions on those obligations.

Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's) and Standard & Poor's Financial Services (""S&P"") are two major credit rating agencies that notch up or notch down instruments within the same corporate family depending on placement in an obligor's capital structure and their level of collateral.

The base from which an instrument is notched in either direction is an obligor's senior unsecured debt (base = 0) or the corporate family rating (CFR). Notching also applies to the structural subordination of debt issued by operating subsidiaries or holding companies according to S&P. As an example the debt of a holding company of an enterprise could be rated lower than the debt of the subsidiaries the entities that directly own the enterprise's assets and cash flows.

Notching is not a precise science and credit rating agencies may use different approaches to determine the credit risk of bond and debt issuers. As a result it is not uncommon for different credit rating agencies to assign different credit ratings to the same issuer.

Moody's Updated Notching Guidance

In 2017 Moody's published an update to its 2007 notching methodology. This most recent guidance indicated as ""applicable in most cases"" was as follows:

Senior secured debt: +1 or +2 notches above the base (0)

Senior unsecured debt: 0

Subordinated debt: -1 or -2

Junior subordinated debt: -1 or -2

Preferred stock: -2

In a small number of cases Moody's will notch beyond the -2 to +2 range under one or more of the following circumstances:

An unbalanced capital structure results in a particular obligation comprising a very small or large proportion of total debt.

A legal regime is less predictable.

There is extra complexity in the legal structure of a corporation.

Tranche Notching Notching is not just used to evaluate the credit risk of bond and debt issuers. It is also used to evaluate the credit risk of other types of financial instruments such as structured finance products such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). CDOs are complex securities that are backed by a pool of assets such as mortgages or corporate bonds. The credit risk of a CDO is determined by evaluating the credit risk of the assets that make up the pool. This process is known as ""tranche notching"" and it involves assigning different credit ratings to different tranches (or slices) of the CDO based on the level of subordination of the tranches. Tranches that are more highly subordinated (i.e. ranked lower in the repayment hierarchy) are considered to be more risky and are assigned lower credit ratings. Tranches that are more senior (i.e. ranked higher in the repayment hierarchy) are considered to be less risky and are assigned higher credit ratings.

Example of Notching

Imagine that ABC Company has issued two corporate bonds: Bond A and Bond B. Bond A is a senior bond which means that it has a higher priority for repayment in the event of default compared to Bond B. Bond B is a junior bond which means that it has a lower priority for repayment.

ABC Company's creditworthiness is evaluated by a credit rating agency which determines that the company has a strong financial profile and is likely to be able to make timely interest and principal payments on both Bond A and Bond B. As a result the credit rating agency assigns ABC Company an A credit rating and assigns both Bond A and Bond B an A credit rating as well.

However over time ABC Company's financial performance begins to deteriorate. It takes on more debt and its profits decline which raises concerns about its ability to meet its financial obligations. As a result the credit rating agency conducts a review of ABC Company's creditworthiness and decides to downgrade the company's overall credit rating from A to BBB.

In this case the credit rating agency would use notching to express the difference in credit risk between Bond A and Bond B. Since Bond A is a senior bond it is considered to be less risky than Bond B and is assigned a BBB+ credit rating. Bond B on the other hand is considered to be more risky and is assigned a BBB- credit rating. The difference in credit risk between Bond A and Bond B is expressed as two notches with Bond A having a higher credit rating (and a lower notch) than Bond B.

What Is a Notch in Bond Rating? In bond trading a notch is a measure of the difference in credit risk between two bonds usually issued by the same issuer. It is calculated by taking the difference in the credit ratings of the two bonds and expressing it in terms of notches. For example if one bond has a credit rating of A- and another bond has a credit rating of BBB+ the difference in credit risk between the two bonds would be expressed as one notch.

Why Is Notching Important? Notching is important because it helps investors to make informed decisions about the creditworthiness of the various bonds and debt instruments issued by the same issuers by using easy to understand ratings grades or scores. By understanding the likelihood of default investors can determine the level of risk they are willing to take on when investing in a particular bond or debt issuer. This is especially important for investors who are considering purchasing high-yield bonds as these bonds are generally considered to be more risky than investment-grade bonds. Notching can also be used by bond and debt issuers to determine their own creditworthiness as it can help them to identify any areas where they may need to improve their financial health in order to attract investors.

What Is a Notch Downgrade? A notch downgrade is a decrease in the credit rating of a particular bond from a debt issuer. It is expressed in terms of notches with each notch representing a difference in credit risk. For example if a bond issuer's credit rating is downgraded from A- to BBB+ the downgrade would be expressed as one notch. A notch downgrade can occur when the creditworthiness of the bond or debt issuer deteriorates. This can be due to a variety of factors including declining financial performance increased debt levels or changes in market conditions that affect the issuer's ability to meet its financial obligations. A notch downgrade can have significant implications for the issuer as it may make it more difficult for the issuer to access funding in the future and may also lead to an increase in the issuer's borrowing costs. It can also have negative consequences for investors in the issuer's bonds as a downgrade may indicate an increased risk of default and may lead to a decrease in the value of the bonds.

What Is Subordination-Based Notching? Subordination-based notching is a method of rating the credit risk of bond or debt issuers based on the level of subordination of the issuer's debts. Subordination refers to the ranking of debts in terms of priority for repayment in the event that the issuer becomes bankrupt or is unable to meet its financial obligations. Debts that are ranked higher in the subordination hierarchy are considered to be more senior and are more likely to be repaid in the event of default. Subordination-based notching is used to determine the credit rating of an issuer by taking into account the level of subordination of the issuer's debts. For example an issuer with highly subordinated debts (i.e. debts that are ranked lower in the subordination hierarchy) may be assigned a lower credit rating than an issuer with more senior debts. This is because the issuer with highly subordinated debts is considered to be at a higher risk of default as it is less likely to have the financial resources available to meet its obligations. Subordination-based notching is often used in the evaluation of structured finance instruments such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).

The Bottom Line

Notching is the process of rating the credit risk of the various bonds from the same debt issuer such as a company or a government using discrete rating levels or notches. So if a company issues several bonds not every one may receive the same credit rating based on its relative riskiness terms features subordination and clauses. It is used to determine the likelihood that the issuer will default on its debt obligations. Notching can be used to determine the credit rating of an issuer which is a measure of the issuer's ability to make timely interest and principal payments. Notching can also be used to determine the risk premium that investors should demand for taking on the risk of investing in the bond or debt issuer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmludmVudGl2YS5jby5pbi90cmVuZHMvdG9wLTEwLWJlc3QtZGF0YS1hbmFseXRpY3MtaW5zdGl0dXRlcy1pbi1pbmRpYS1pbi0yMDIzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Top 10 Best Data Analytics Institutes In India In 2023,"Introduction of Data Analytics

MS,Morgan Stanley,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRlc2xhcmF0aS5jb20vdGVzbGEtc3RvY2stcmVib3VuZC1tb3JnYW4tc3RhbmxleS_SAUFodHRwczovL3d3dy50ZXNsYXJhdGkuY29tL3Rlc2xhLXN0b2NrLXJlYm91bmQtbW9yZ2FuLXN0YW5sZXkvYW1wLw?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Tesla stock rebound by over 100% still possible says Morgan Stanley,"By

Long-time Tesla bull Adam Jonas of Morgan Stanley remains bullish on Tesla stock despite its disastrous end of the year.

Tesla stock concluded the year down by more than 65% from its peak. And while some have heralded this as the company’s fall Mr. Jonas of Morgan Stanley believes jumping ship may be premature. Furthermore according to a client note published by MarketInsider Mr. Jonas thinks the stock may still rebound by up to 122%.

There are a couple of key points from Mr. Jonas’ client note. Foremost while Morgan Stanley’s price target for Tesla has been adjusted downwards from $330 to $250 this would still be a 122% jump from its current share price of just under $125. Two main factors Mr. Jonas cites as positive signs for the stock include the adoption of the Inflation Reduction Act EV incentives and its position in the market that remains poised for overall growth.

This isn’t to say that Tesla doesn’t face challenges in the near future. Mr. Jonas states “Between a worsening macro backdrop record-high unfavorability and increasing competition there are hurdles to overcome. Yet we do believe that in the face of all these pressures Tesla will widen its lead in the EV race as it leverages its cost and scale advantages to further itself from the competition.”

Mr. Jonas did not address Twitter or allegations of faltering Tesla demand but there is good reason to be optimistic. While it remains unclear if Tesla CEO Elon Musk will be leaving his position at Twitter anytime soon (which many alleged would quell concerns) he has at least announced that he intends to find a replacement. As for claims that Tesla’s demand is faltering a common argument from Tesla bears Tesla inventories seem to indicate otherwise.

Morgan Stanley is not the only group that remains bullish on Tesla’s position. Even as Tesla’s stock slid to its low point earlier in 2022 Goldman Sachs maintained its buy rating and reiterated a price target of $333. Furthermore market analysts from Forbes and the Motley Fool have continually reiterated that the Tesla stock’s strong fundamentals will likely propel it upwards in the new year.

Going into the new year many will hope for a stock recovery from the EV leader. While that likely won’t happen overnight many analysts remain hopeful for the company. If anything a successful Q4 report and investor meeting later this month or next could be the inflection point that Tesla needs.

The Gettel Automotive Group donated a car to a veteran Dec. 9 a most welcome gift after his SUV was totaled while he was in South Sarasota County helping victims of Hurricane Ian.

Kirk Wildasin served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1992 to 2001. The honor graduate from the Military Police School was selected for assignment to HMX-1 Security Detail the presidential helicopter squadron charged with protecting Marine One and the president of the United States.

The Venice resident currently works for Taylor Morrison Homes. Previously he helped veterans while employed by the Veterans Services Office in Venice.

Wildasin 48 has been an active board member for SRQ Vets since its founding in 2015. The volunteer-run nonprofit works with local and national organizations to solve local veteran problems.

During Hurricane Ian Wildasin was in contact with family members and friends. Some had trees that fell into their driveways trapping them in their homes.

He was able to coordinate where to go and who to help first. He also helped to clear roads using his 1999 Chevy Tahoe 4x4 to drag trees to the side so cars could make their way through.

The work was so intensive that his chainsaw chain became dull. Wildasin drove to an equipment store to buy a new chain. On his way home he was T-boned by another vehicle.

He suffered only minor injuries but his SUV was totaled. The amount from his insurance company simply wasn’t enough to purchase another vehicle.

Gettel Automotive Group gave Wildasin a 2019 Toyota Corolla Hatchback XSE. He was recommended for the gift by SRQ Vets and Goodwill Manasota.

Reuters had reported in November that SpaceX was in talks about an offering of mostly secondary shares that could value the company at up to $150 billion representing a 20% increase in valuation.

SpaceX which counts Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O and Fidelity Investments among its investors had raised about $1.68 billion through equity financing in June.

Spokespersons for SpaceX and Horowitz did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. Horowitz was also a co-investor in Musk's Twitter buyout deal worth $44 billion.

SpaceX has launched numerous cargo payloads and astronauts to the International Space Station for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

Starlink SpaceX's growing network of thousands of internet satellites is looking at generating major revenue with commercialized applications such as the rollout of high-speed internet on commercial airlines.

SpaceX competes with Amazon.com AMZN.O founder Jeff Bezos's space venture Blue Origin and billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic SPCE.N.

The news was confirmed by series co-creator Baran bo Odar through a statement shared to his official Instagram. The letter to fans was also signed by Odar’s partner and series co-creator Jantje Freise.

“With a heavy heart we have to tell you that ‘1899’ will not be renewed” Odar wrote. “We would have loved to finish this incredible journey with a second and third season as we did with ‘Dark.’ But sometimes things don’t turn out the way you planned. That’s life.”

“We know this will disappoint millions of fans out there. But we want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts that you were a part of this wonderful adventure” the statement continues. “We love you. Never forget.”

Netflix was not immediately available for comment.

“1899” which followed a group of immigrants aboard a ship faced with a series of mysterious events debuted on the streamer on Nov. 17 2022. In its first week of availability the international production cracked Netflix’s top 10 chart at the No. 2 slot behind only “The Crown” Season 5. Within four days “1899” garnered about 79.27 million hours of viewership.

The series served as a follow-up to Adar and Friese’s previous series “Dark” a landmark international breakout for Netflix that debuted its first episodes in 2017. With a beloved run across three seasons Friese and Odar set an overall deal with Netflix — the first of its kind for the streamer’s European presence. “1899” was the first project to emerge from that agreement.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiXmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWRhaWx5YmVhc3QuY29tL29ic2Vzc2VkL2thbGVpZG9zY29wZS1vbi1uZXRmbGl4LXJldmlldy0yMDIzcy1maXJzdC1ncmVhdC1zZXJpZXPSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,'Kaleidoscope' on Netflix Review: 2023's First Great Series,"Kaleidoscope like its namesake explosion of fractals has plenty of beautiful things to look at—and I don’t just mean Jai Courtney one of the members of an elite heist team put together to break into a bank vault for the $7 billion score of a lifetime.

Netflix’s latest limited series which launched Jan. 1 is intentionally designed with shiny distractions that keep your eyes darting about. There are vivid colors and hidden secrets everywhere you look making each episode its own hypnotic guessing game. It’s a clever tactic one that effectively builds on the show’s unique watch experience.

See Kaleidoscope is created so that its first seven episodes can be watched in any order. Not only that but each Netflix subscriber will have their episode order presented to them in a different sequence. There are no episode numbers with each installment instead paired with a color code: “Yellow” “Pink” “Orange” “Blue” “Green” “Violet” and “Red.” “White” the series finale is placed at the bottom of the order for every user

Some might think of this nonlinear structure as a gimmick superficial trickery used to hook viewers and convince them to watch all the way to the end without suffering binge burnout. Is Netflix really shuffling the episodes and will things really play out all that differently if you watch them out of order? The short answer is “Yes.” And to prove it I intentionally jumped around from the episode order I was presented so I could test Netflix’s proposition.

As it turns out Kaleidoscope is even more fun if you play around with it. Upon closer examination Netflix mixes up the episodes for each user in three different sets: The first two installments (“Yellow” and “Green”) followed by the middle three (“Orange” “Blue” and “Violet”) concluding with the final two prior to the finale (“Red” and “Pink”). But undoubtedly some users will break the rules and hop around looking for clues that help make sense of the series and testing whether the disorganized nature actually works.

The series itself is a delightful mind-bender one that’s even more satisfying to connect the dots to when you think about how the episodes will play in different orders. But Kaleidoscope doesn’t only rely on the unusual narrative device it uses to snare its viewers. Beneath those shuffled colors is a slick and stylish heist series that keeps the tension building as it skips through timelines.

Viewers will find that their allegiances change depending on the episode order making the greed and betrayal even more intriguing. Pair all of that with a cast of stellar performers whose characters are as cunning as they are conniving and Netflix had just dropped the first great series of 2023.

To pull off an effective heist—and an effective heist series—the first thing you need is a charismatic ringleader. Kaleidoscope’s would be Leo Pap played by one of Hollywood’s greatest secret weapons Giancarlo Esposito. Leo a career criminal has emerged from hiding to assemble a new team for his final job: Robbing SLS Security Systems the most secure bank vault in the entire world and home to billions of dollars in dirty bonds.

Leo taps his old prison cellmate Stan (Peter Mark Kendall) to dig into a network of petty thieves for their crew. For a successful job they’ll need a crooked lawyer Ava (Paz Vega); a safe-cracker Bob (Jai Courtney); a driver RJ (Jordan Mendoza); and a chemist Judy (Rosaline Elbay).

With Leo’s crew compiled they’ve got to find a way to drum up the seed cash that will allow them to pull off their grand scheme. To make money they’ll have to steal money. Most episodes depict these mini-heists: a jailbreak a jewelry store robbery a charity gala swindling. Each one takes place sometime over the course of 25 years some before the $7 billion SLS vault heist and some after. Each smaller score has its own consequences that affect the larger story at play making both the characters and the audience ponder who can be trusted.

It all leads up to “White” the episode in which the grand heist takes place. The novelty of placing the fallout from this main event well before the heist episode itself might piss off those who are desperate to watch the robbery go down. But ultimately this structuring works wonders for Kaleidoscope. By the time audiences get to the day-after-the-heist episode “Red” they’ll be so intrigued by seeing the robbery’s aftermath that it will make watching the finale all the more exciting.

The series’ nonlinear structure allows Kaleidoscope to be free from genre conventions. There is no third-act reveal to tell us how the robbery went down which so many crime stories rely on. Streaming television has been home to plenty of nonlinear storytelling but reformatting that style for a heist is an inspired twist. This isn’t an Ocean’s film; Brad Pitt is (thankfully) nowhere to be found and we’re not forced to wait until the final 20 minutes to watch how the crew pulled it all off.

“ I giggled with pure delight more than a few times just watching things fall into place. ”

In Kaleidoscope we’re provided with just enough of the post-heist repercussions and pre-crime tensions that when we see the job happen in real time the payoffs are delicious—so much so that I giggled with pure delight more than a few times just watching things fall into place.

But the most glinting and gorgeous parts of Kaleidoscope’s ever-changing colorful mystery are the ones that most heist stories forget to include: real human dynamics. These characters may be criminals but they’re not beyond feeling. There are proper emotional stakes at hand especially when Leo’s estranged daughter Hannah (Gabrielle Kim) comes back into his life. Each actor is pulling their weight—Paz Vega is particularly amusing stomping around in trench coats and berets toting guns while walking her dogs—but the real standouts are Esposito and Kim.

Leo and Hannah’s father-daughter relationship is the consistent throughline of a nonlinear portrait the North Sstar that guides the series toward its epic conclusion. What happened between them to cause the fissure and how will her presence affect Leo’s plans? Those two questions are ultimately answered but the build-up to their resolution over eight satisfying episodes is what makes the series’ conclusion so damn potent.

Everything isn’t quite wrapped up so neatly though. There are undoubtedly plenty of Easter eggs planted throughout the series that will keep internet sleuths and obsessive Redditors busy theorizing about until the winter snow thaws. This is a series for the adventuresome viewer and the casual watcher alike.

Early in “Yellow” Esposito’s voiceover tells us that trust is the most paramount part of a heist. Figuring out who to believe is the game we’re playing each time we hit play grabbing another piece of the puzzle. We could be duped at any moment as the colors shuffle. But that’s what’s so fun about finishing these brain-teasing jigsaws: Looking at the big picture from above finally put together all of your hard work paid off.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS90di90di1uZXdzLzE4OTktY2FuY2VsZWQtbmV0ZmxpeC0xMjM1Mjg5OTEzL9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhvbGx5d29vZHJlcG9ydGVyLmNvbS90di90di1uZXdzLzE4OTktY2FuY2VsZWQtbmV0ZmxpeC0xMjM1Mjg5OTEzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,‘1899’ Netflix Series Canceled After One Season,"Netflix‘s 1899 has been canceled after one season.

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter Adar and Friese teased that they had already had ideas for a second and third season for 1899.

1899 was a follow-up to Adar and Friese’s previous series Dark which lasted for three seasons. In 2018 Friese and Odar signed an exclusive multiple-year overall deal with the streamer.

As part of the reported deal the home Test summer and selected Big Bash League matches will remain on Seven while subscription broadcaster Fox is set to continue showing Tests and the BBL as well as white-ball internationals and other domestic competitions.

News Corp reports the new contract spans five years and will begin when the current deal expires in 2024.

American media giant Paramount which owns Network 10 had been the primary suitor hoping to plunder the cricket and made a reported $1.5 billion offer to Cricket Australia (CA) that was more lucrative than those tabled by the Australian networks.

Paramount's streaming service Paramount Plus rolled out to Australia in August 2021 and is already in the local sporting market as broadcaster of the A-Leagues and Australian soccer internationals.

But it is understood CA felt neither Paramount Plus nor its struggling free-to-air affiliate Network 10 could match the reach of the current broadcast hosts.

Fox has a base of 4.4 million subscribers nearly 1.3 million of whom are signed up to streaming platform Kayo while Seven's Test coverage has continued to rate among the highest programs on free-to-air television this summer.

Paramount Plus has yet to disclose its own figures but August estimates from market research specialist Roy Morgan placed the platform's local subscriber base at around 400000.

CA's decision to overlook Paramount comes after the AFL opted to reject the American company's advances last year despite it being the highest bidder on that occasion as well.

The new deal signals a burying of the hatchet for Cricket Australia and Seven after the network took CA to the Federal Court seeking to terminate the last two years of its current six-year contract over alleged breaches.

Seven had been seeking documents to determine whether CA had exercised 'reasonable endeavours' to ensure the BBL matched the quality of rival leagues including the Indian Premier League but were understood to have been willing to drop the case if the current deals were extended.

The Corps announced in August 2022 that it would make the change to be more accurate and conscious of gender-specific differences following the conclusion of a yearlong study.

Marines previously were subject solely to the tape test method which measures a service member’s neck waist and other body parts against their height.

Under the new guidelines however troops will not be subsequently assigned to the service’s body composition program ― which helps to manage weight or separates them for not meeting standards ― until their body composition also is calculated using the new X-ray scanners and other tech employed in the study.

The Marine Corps’ Training and Education Command already began fielding 257 of the machines to prepare for the upcoming requirement according to a release from the command.

Col. Eric R. Quehl director of policy and standards for the Marine Corps’ TECOM told Marine Corps Times during an interview in September what drove the service to explore this switch: “The whole purpose of us looking at this issue taking a really hard look at it is ensuring that we do have a good proper balance between performance health and well-being of the force” he said. “And of course readiness.”

Maj. Tamara Velding volunteered for the body composition study at The Basic School in Quantico Virginia becoming one of more than 2000 Marines who signed up to participate.

“All of the equipment and technology was really simple” she told Marine Corps Times in September 2022 saying the whole data collection took about 30 minutes in total. “It didn’t feel invasive or anything like that.”

Under the new guidelines however troops will not be subsequently assigned to the service’s body composition program which helps to manage their weight or separates them for not meeting standards until their body composition a calculated using the new X-ray scanners and other tech employed in the study.

Also making its way back to retail in 2023 is the Air Footscape Woven per a Nike document that was viewed by Complex. News of its return was initially reported by Sole Retriever last week.

The document reveals that this year’s Air Footscape Woven retro will be available in a black/smoke grey colorway for $150 and a brown cow-print version for $160. The two styles are women’s releases that will only be available at Nike’s “neighborhood” retail partners according to the document.

Designed by Tory Orzeck the original Nike Air Footscape made its debut in 1996. The Footscape Woven which is a hybrid of the Air Footscape and Air Woven silhouettes first released in the mid-2000s. The shoe is best known for its asymmetrical lacing system and woven stripe across the suede-based upper.

Nike has released several permutation of the Air Footscape since its introduction in the ‘90s including the Flyknit soccer-inspired Air Footscape Magista from 2015.

Owen a Republican Member of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and its successor Surface Transportation Board (STB) from Oct. 4 1994 to Dec. 31 1998 died Dec. 17 2022 at age 89.

Controversy escorted Owen into office and accompanied his departure with celebrity and politics attending much of his life. In his four years as a rail regulator he voted to approve three Class I railroad mergers: Burlington Northern with Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe; Union Pacific’s (UP) acquisition of Southern Pacific (SP); and Conrail’s joint acquisition by CSX and Norfolk Southern. He advocated liberalizing unionized-worker post-merger income protection implementing agreements and expressed skepticism during his term over the agency’s findings that railroads were not revenue adequate.

A three-member agency during Owen’s tenure his relationship with Democrat Chairperson Linda J. Morgan was cordial at best while Owen closely bonded with Democratic member Jacob J. Simmons III owing largely to their Oklahoma roots—Simmons in the family’s oil business Owen having been raised there. After Morgan ceased hosting in her office a weekly informal—no agency cases discussed—coffee and doughnuts meeting Owen and Simmons met regularly numerous times weekly in each other’s open-door offices to chat informally on politics and other subjects unrelated to agency cases.

Despite not completing high school—on his LinkedIn page he emphasized having left Central High School in Muskogee Okla. in the ninth grade earning a general education degree (GED) in the Marine Corps—Owen became immensely successful in California real estate which included purchasing distressed multi-resident properties rehabilitating them and flipping them for profit.

Owen’s business success channeled him into California Republican politics. He worked on the presidential campaigns of Republicans Barry Goldwater Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan. Future Republican President Gerald R. Ford when a House member from Michigan recruited Owen as a congressional campaign manager for 15 Western states.

Owen also was a founder of the Republican Orange County Lincoln Club that funneled campaign contributions from a wealthy business elite to state and federal Republican candidates. But it was his wife Kathryn Thompson’s controversial political activity that secured his nomination to the ICC by Bill Clinton.

Kathryn Thompson

Thompson—also immensely successful in California real estate an inductee into the California Building Industry Hall of Fame and also a Lincoln Club Member who reportedly backed the 1988 successful presidential run of Republican George H. W. Bush with a $100000 contribution—turned on Bush in 1992 to back his Democratic opponent Clinton.

Her opposition to a second Bush term was owed to Bush’s backtracking on his “read my lips: no new taxes” pledge during the 1988 Republican National Convention—new taxes and other economic policies that cost real estate entrepreneurs significant sums. It was reported that Thompson Orange County’s third largest home builder in 1991 quickly tumbled to “no ranking” as the economy under Bush’s presidency ebbed.

In her role as a founder of California Republicans for Clinton—a group credited for turning Bush’s 1988 California electoral victory into a 13-percentage point win for Clinton in 1992—she elicited public outrage from California Republicans including arch conservative congressmen Robert K. Dornan and Dana Rohrabacher. Thompson’s subsequent appearance on Larry King’s network television talk show earned additional displeasure from Republicans nationwide including Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. A month into Clinton’s White House stay he praised Thompson in a Feb. 23 1993 speech.

Owen not only survived the embarrassment of the Clinton-Thompson political alliance but a year following Clinton’s inauguration Clinton nominated Owen in May 1994 to a vacant Republican slot on the ICC with Dole overlooking bygones to back Owen’s September 1994 Senate confirmation. Clinton later named Thompson to the Federal National Mortgage Association’s (Fannie Mae) Board of Directors.

Owen enjoyed celebrity frequently recounting a personal friendship with singing-cowboy movie star Gene Autry private conversations with fellow Californians Nixon and Reagan and oft stopping by the congressional office of singer-turned-California-politician Sonny Bono for a chat. In winter Owen walked about outside in a full-length mink coat he proudly said was a gift from his wife and formerly belonging to movie star Rock Hudson who had worn it in the movie “Lover Come Back.”

During the pendency of the UP-SP transaction Owen met privately with SP’s majority owner Phillip Anschutz who was escorted to Owen’s STB office by UP lobbyist Mary McAuliffe. Owen later said that he and Anschutz spoke alone only of their mutual interest in soccer. Owen had coached youth soccer including teams he took to England and Germany and was instrumental in bringing a FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) soccer tournament to Los Angeles in 1994. Anschutz was a co-founder of multiple professional soccer teams including the Los Angeles Galaxy.

In 1995 when the STB found eight of then-11 Class I railroads not to be revenue adequate Owen wrote “Class I freight railroads exceeded earnings per share estimates of independent financial analysts in 1995 they have posted sustained ton-mile growth over the past decade and they have made remarkable and sustained productivity gains through rationalization of the workforce fixed-plant and equipment. Such an incongruity begs for further study of the methods we utilize to determine revenue adequacy.”

In 1998 Owen withdrew his name from consideration for renomination to a second term following commencement of an investigation into him by U.S. Department of Transportation Inspector General (DOT IG) Kenneth Mead—a probe requested by Senate Commerce Committee Chairperson John McCain (R-Ariz.) following a complaint by the Ralph Nader-aligned Congressional Accountability Project. Questioned was whether Owen’s outside business activities “are compatible” with his STB responsibilities; whether he violated ethics rules by receiving outside income; and whether his financial disclosure reports “have significant gaps omissions or false statements.”

Owen departed the agency upon the Dec. 31 1998 expiration of his first term with the investigation not concluded.

A subsequent 22-page IG “Summary of Findings” concluded Owen had failed to disclose his leadership role in a Southern California Edison-backed group advocating deregulation of California electric utilities discussed deregulation of electric utilities with a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Member without disclosing his membership in a group backed by utilities omitted on his financial disclosure forms information as to real estate holdings and spent some one-third of average work weeks away from his office. Mead said there were “no clear findings of wrongdoing” but “questionable judgment in certain instances.”

Only two other of 117 ICC/STB members have come under ethics probes since the regulatory agency was created in 1887.

In 1955 ICC Member Hugh W. Cross resigned following a Senate probe into influence peddling—Cross alleged to have assisted a motor carrier in obtaining a contract to shuttle passengers and baggage between Chicago’s then-numerous rail-passenger stations. The ICC had no regulatory authority over the transportation at issue. In resigning Cross admitted to “indiscreet” conversations with three railroad CEOs but denied he acted improperly. The Senate Government Operations Committee agreed calling his resignation “quite proper” and concluding there was “no useful purpose” in further inquiry.

In 1990 ICC Chairperson Heather J. Gradison came under investigation by the DOT IG following her term-expiration departure. An IG report outlined improper contacts and communications between ICC officials and members of the Maine congressional delegation and their staffs including Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-Maine). At issue according to news reports were “agency practices while handling various cases involving Guilford Transportation Industries.” No further action was taken and Gradison said she felt “totally redeemed” by the findings. “There was no indication anywhere in the report of criminal intent or illegal activity” she said. “No Canons of Conduct were broken by members of my staff and certainly I didn’t break any.”

After Owen departed the STB in December 1998 he left California for Dallas with intermediate residential stops in Kanas City and Muskogee. He continued to operate Owen Properties a commercial and residential property firm until his death. His wife of 33 years Kathryn Thompson survives him and operates in Dallas as a mortgage banker.

Railway Age Capitol Hill Contributing Editor Frank N. Wilner was—prior to being recruited by Owen as his Chief of Staff and appointed to the post by President Clinton—Assistant Vice President for Policy at the Association of American Railroads. Wilner also served a term as President of the ICC/STB bar association and is author of seven books on railroad economics and regulation.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiUGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhdzM2MC5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTU1NjA3OC9wcm9kdWN0LWxpYWJpbGl0eS1jYXNlcy10by13YXRjaC1pbi0yMDIz0gEraHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubGF3MzYwLmNvbS9hbXAvYXJ0aWNsZXMvMTU1NjA3OA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Product Liability Cases To Watch In 2023,"PLEASE NOTE: A verification email will be sent to your address before you can access your trial.

Several Web3 use cases including DeFi GameFi SocialFi and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) emerged through the last bullish cycle. DeFi has been the largest market cap activity within Web3 with a peak total value locked (TVL) of over $175 billion at the peak of the 2021 bull market.

DeFi: The primary use case for blockchain?

Things have not been the same since the Bitcoin genesis block was created. Thanks to the rise of Ethereum that followed DeFi has seen product market fit. Through the previous Bitcoin (BTC) bull market DeFi TVL rose from $600 million in January 2020 to $180 billion in December 2021.

The TVL within DeFi has held on to over $39 billion despite the market crisis in 2022. DeFi has democratized access to financial services as it doesn’t need a centralized organization to onboard users. Apart from the democratization DeFi has also opened up new models like automated market making.

All these innovative elements have catalyzed the growth of DeFi protocols and applications. This has also helped other adjacent use cases such as NFTs and GameFi to grow. For instance lending models with “NFTs as collateral” have seen good uptake. Additionally DeFi-based models and marketplaces for gaming NFTs have emerged allowing gaming guilds to tap into them.

Despite these interesting developments DeFi shrank to a mere $39 billion in 2022. Let us see what transpired in 2022 and what we can expect in 2023 for DeFi.

Fall from grace

The year 2022 started with a broader market fall. Within the Web3 ecosystem Solana’s Wormhole bridge was hacked leading to $310 million worth of crypto assets being stolen. Thanks to a few projects on the Solana ecosystem they managed to emerge out of this abyss.

However in March rumors about the credibility of the Terra ecosystem and its algorithmic stablecoin started to emerge. As the market took a further fall through April and May the network collapsed leading to a broader market sell-off.

1/ I’ve spent the last few days on the phone calling Terra community members – builders community members employees friends and family that have been devastated by UST depegging.



I am heartbroken about the pain my invention has brought on all of you. — Do Kwon (@stablekwon) May 13 2022

Following the Terra episode the markets recovered through the summer only to be dragged back down by the FTX debacle. While the FTX situation cannot be categorized entirely as a DeFi issue as it was the result of alleged misconduct at a centralized exchange some have noted the effect FTX and its associated firm Alameda had on the ecosystem.

This is fairly public knowledge at this point but the large currency contraction that UST went through in Feb 2021 was started by Alameda when they sold 500mm UST in minutes to drain its curve pools during the MIM crisis — Do Kwon (@stablekwon) December 8 2022

Despite the bloodshed the DeFi industry has quietly kept building and innovating. 2022 was also marked by several institutional DeFi headlines that could yield benefits over the coming years.

The Bitcoin network is starting to see utility as the Lightning Network allows projects to build on top of it. Cash App integrated the Lightning Network for faster Bitcoin transactions. There are several other payment applications that could potentially change the “store of value” narrative for the apex asset.

The DeFi TVL on the Ethereum network before the previous bull run started was a few hundred million dollars. The DeFi TVLs on several layer-1 and layer-2 networks namely Avalanche Solana Polygon and Arbitrum are at a few hundred million dollars each. As the next Bitcoin halving comes around all these ecosystems should see DeFi growth.

While market sentiment has not been positive there have been a huge number of positive developments within DeFi so what does 2023 hold for DeFi?

Security and DeFi

Hackers ran rampant in 2022 causing DeFi crypto investors to lose considerable amounts of money. As regulations ramp up and institutional adoption shows promise there would have to be a few key developments in this space.

Click “Collect” below the illustration at the top of the page or follow this link.

The crypto industry has lost close to $3 billion across 125 hacks as of October 2022. This hurts the reputation of the space and is a huge hurdle in attracting institutional capital. In response the DeFi ecosystem has already started creating applications that inform wallet holders of what a smart contract intends to do before the user signs it.

However more needs to be done to address security vulnerabilities around oracles and cross-chain bridges. More decentralization of cross-chain bridges is a good step forward. Also DeFi platforms will start considering insurance products more seriously to protect user funds. Firms like CertiK and Hacken offer specialized cybersecurity solutions to Web3 platforms.

DeFi and self-custody

The failure of several prominent centralized exchanges and platforms in 2022 has already helped shift volumes to DeFi platforms. However DeFi is still largely reliant on centralized platforms to onboard new users and convert fiat to cryptocurrencies and vice versa. This trend is being challenged and could change in 2023.

As more users choose DeFi over centralized financial solutions on-ramping infrastructure into the crypto world should improve. Wallets will have on-ramp plugins like MoonPay and Ramp that will connect to users’ credit cards Apple Pay or bank accounts to convert fiat to cryptocurrencies and vice versa.

Another key on-ramp feature that has emerged is wallets that do not need users to manage private keys. As user experience starts taking center stage DeFi solutions could see more first-time users.

Web3 gaming

2022 saw a number of gaming projects with DeFi integrations trying to find market share. In 2023 these projects will continue maturing and growing with DeFi as a strong pull factor.

Web3 gaming has found itself in a unique position in the entire ecosystem and could be the growth hack that Web3 has been looking for. While the games still struggle with playability ecosystem-specific earning models staking and farming will provide unique offerings and value propositions that traditional games lack.

Can regulators be far behind?

With catastrophic failures from marquee companies and loss of user funds central banks and regulators will start having a greater say in DeFi.

While counter-intuitive to the ethos of what Web3 stands for central banks will start creating regulations and legislation for consumer protection. If United States regulators crack the 90-year-old Howie Test whip and deem most cryptocurrencies as securities that will most certainly affect this space in the short-to-medium term.

Until crypto platforms comply with time-tested securities laws risks to investors will persist. It remains a priority of the SEC to use all of our available tools to bring the industry into compliance. https://t.co/m8oh0gTvc3 — Gary Gensler (@GaryGensler) December 22 2022

However some regulation has helped the space gain more credibility. Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) controls as well as conduct rules for labeling DeFi-related financial products could bring certainty to the space and encourage investors.

Institutional DeFi on the rise

Institutional interest in DeFi has picked up over the last year. Payments custody and AML solutions have particularly seen interest from large banks and financial institutions.

Barclays bought a stake in Copper an institutional crypto custody firm while Standard Chartered’s innovation arm partnered with investment management firm Northern Trust to launch Zodia a cryptocurrency custodian for institutional investors.

Bank of New York Mellon the world’s largest custodian bank partnered with Chainalysis to help track and analyze cryptocurrency products.

Financial services firms such as BlackRock and Citigroup invested over $1 billion each in DeFi platforms through 2022. As these firms see more institutional clients interested in the crypto asset class they will be compelled to create offerings to support their clients.

With more central banks rolling out plans for their own digital currencies banks will need to prepare themselves for the on-chain world.

On-chain banking would be the next phase of digital banking where transaction finality and reconciliation would be instantaneous giving rise to new business models and financial products. 2023 would see key steps in this direction.

In summary DeFi is poised to mature and stabilize through 2023. Any new technology has its ups and downs. Having seen a strong bullish phase and a grueling bearish slump the time is ripe for stable growth based on wisdom gained through the experiences of 2022.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiN2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jby51ay9uZXdzL3VrLW5vcnRoZXJuLWlyZWxhbmQtNjQwNTI3OTfSATtodHRwczovL3d3dy5iYmMuY28udWsvbmV3cy91ay1ub3J0aGVybi1pcmVsYW5kLTY0MDUyNzk3LmFtcA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,One Million Trees Project aims to double Belfast's tree cover,"""While you're a student living up in Queen's you don't get to know the other people around Belfast but through Handy Helpers and initiatives like helping out at the tree nursery you really do get to meet new people and it's fantastic.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMitwFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iZWxmYXN0dGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvLnVrL25ld3Mvbm9ydGhlcm4taXJlbGFuZC9ub3J0aGVybi1pcmVsYW5kLWhvc3BpdGFscy1hcmUtbGlrZS1hLXdhcnpvbmUtYW5kLXNpdHVhdGlvbi1pcy11bnN1c3RhaW5hYmxlLWFsbGlhbmNlLW1sYS13b3JraW5nLWFzLW51cnNlLXdhcm5zLzQyMjU3OTg1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Northern Ireland hospitals are like a warzone and situation is unsustainable: Alliance MLA working as nurse warns,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk', port=443): Read timed out.

Groden said that number should be reduced when his El Segundo-based aerospace company begins delivery of its FlightOS software.

“Our goal is to make it easier and safer for pilots to fly general aviation aircraft” Groden said.

The aerospace industry is still a major one in the Los Angeles basin. It encompasses the big players like Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc. Northrop Grumman Corp. and The Boeing Co. down to the small machine shops that do work for the big boys. It also includes startups and newer companies such as Skyryse Long Beach-based Rocket Lab USA Inc. and Space Exploration Technologies Corp. better known as SpaceX which is based in Hawthorne.

Last month L3Harris Technologies Inc. which is based in Melbourne Florida announced it was acquiring Aerojet Rocketdyne in an all-cash deal valued at $4.7 billion. The deal is expected to close this year subject to regulatory approvals and clearances and other customary closing conditions.

According to a 2016 study by the Los Angeles County Economic Development Corp. the Southern California aerospace industry brought in about $40 billion in revenue in 2014. Southern California is made up of eight counties stretching from Kern down to San Diego.

“Of this aircraft accounted for the most sales reaching $12.9 billion or almost one third of all output. Instrumentation accounted for $11 billion or 27.5% of the total while aircraft parts accounted for $8.5 billion.

The value of production of guided missile and space vehicles and their related parts reached $6.5 billion in 2014” according to the study done in conjunction with the San Diego Regional EDC.

About 246000 direct indirect and induced jobs were created by the aerospace market in Southern California in 2014 a number that includes commercial military and civilian employees the LAEDC report found.

“Most people don’t realize this but aerospace is larger than agriculture and entertainment combined in its annual economic impact” said Mark Taylor director of state government operations for Chicago-based Boeing.

In his role Taylor who is based in California helps manage the state and local government relations work and corporate giving in the state.

At the El Segundo facility of the Chicago-based aerospace and defense contractor one will find the largest satellite factory in the world.

In November it delivered two communications satellites to a European customer SES S.A. to provide internet connectivity. Those satellites were launched last month.

“That same team supports all of our space missions including the SLS (rocket) that just powered the Orion capsule on its first journey around the moon and splashed down in the ocean outside of San Diego” Taylor said.

The space team beginning this year will also support the Starliner capsule which will take astronauts to and from the International Space Station.

“We have about 13000 employees in the state and in addition to the work they do supporting our space business we have a large contingent of employees that work to support our commercial airplane business” Taylor added.

With some 14000 commercial jets operated around the world by 900 customers all of the support work is done in California from the global operations center Taylor continued.

“So our engineers and customer-service folks help our customers when issues arise with the planes and keep them operating safely and effectively” he said.

Boeing also has three subsidiaries in the region – Millennium Space Systems in El Segundo CDG in Long Beach and Spectrolab in Sylmar.

The San Fernando Valley company is one of the leaders in the manufacturing of solar arrays for space products – satellites and the like.

Solar panels made at Spectrolab were installed recently on the International Space Station.

“They just helped repower the space station with new much more efficient modern solar cells” Taylor said. “They roll out (the solar cells) on top of the existing structure which is pretty amazing.”

And finally there is the activity in Huntington Beach on the XL uncrewed undersea vehicle that is being developed for the U.S. Navy.

“From deep sea to deep space there’s a lot of exciting stuff happening here” Taylor said.

At Skyryse the company is still months away from getting its software in the hands of aircraft manufacturers and owners.

Still the company is growing so rapidly that it will relocate to a new headquarters this month also in El Segundo.

“We wanted to keep our headquarters in El Segundo because we are in the aerospace industry and there is a lot of good aerospace talent in the El Segundo area” Groden said.

The company is also expanding in Ventura County where it uses a regional airport to do flight tests with R66 helicopters made by Robinson Helicopter Co. Inc. which is based in Torrance.

Groden did not disclose the name of the airport an effort to prevent individuals from attempting to look at the contents of the hangars and filming the flight tests Groden said.

“It’s not comfortable for the team which is focused on safety” he added.

The company is also focused on empowering pilots and making it easier and safer for them to fly with the firm’s FlightOS software.

Skyryse is doing that with technology familiar to the Federal Aviation Administration Groden said.

“That is different from what other folks are doing” he added. “All of the pieces that we have built into our product FlightOS have been certified by the FAA.”

The software replaces the complex controls in a typical cockpit with touchscreen tablets and a joystick and its fly-by-wire hardware and software handles everything else. The technology protects the pilot from exiting the flight envelope removes nearly all of the complexities of flying and safely manages the aircraft through emergencies according to a release from the company.

Staying focused

Tim Frei vice president of research and advanced design in the aeronautics systems division of Northrop Grumman said that people often lose focus on what the company is doing up in Palmdale.

The Antelope Valley factory located on Air Force Plant 42 is where the Falls Church Virginia-based aerospace and defense contractor produces the center fuselage for the F-35 Lightning II a single-seat single-engine stealth fighter built by Lockheed Martin.

“Just a few weeks ago we celebrated the delivery of the 1000th center section” Frei said.

Palmdale is also where the Global Hawk unmanned aircraft and its variant the Triton are built along with the two X-47 prototype aircraft that were the first to autonomously take off and land on an aircraft carrier. It is also where maintenance and upgrades are made to the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber.

And the new program for Northrop in Palmdale is the B-21 Raider the Air Force’s latest stealth bomber. The aircraft was unveiled to the public on Dec. 2.

“The B-21 Raider defines a new era in technology and strengthens America’s role in delivering peace through deterrence” Kathy Warden the chief executive of Northrop said in a statement.

Frei said that Los Angeles-area operations are forecast to continue to grow in coming years thanks to programs like the B-21 and other developmental aircraft.

“The work on the B-21 as that program transitions from development into a low-rate and eventually full-rate production we see increases there” he added. “We see the F-35 continuing as a program of record. Those are the two major activities in Palmdale.”

The company also has significant operations in the Los Angeles basin.

At Space Park in Redondo Beach one will find the headquarters of its strategic space systems division and its research and advanced design teams. Space Park is also home to a number of functions for aeronautic systems as well as divisions of the company’s mission systems and defense systems programs.

“All four sectors of Northrop are represented here in Redondo Beach” Frei said.

Additionally a space systems division is housed at a facility in Azusa. In El Segundo Northrop has a significant aerospace presence completing the buildout of the F-18 aircraft in partnership with Boeing; its advanced composite center and other functions for the company are also at that facility Frei said.

Rocket Lab’s “Virginia is for Launch Lovers” mission will send one of its Electron rockets into orbit from the Launch Complex 2 at Virginia Space’s Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport within the NASA Wallops Flight Facility.

It is more importantly for the company the first launch from the U.S. as all of its previous 32 launches of Electron rockets have been from New Zealand.

“This extensive launch heritage already makes Electron the most frequently launched small orbital rocket globally” the company said in a release. “Now with two launch complexes combined Rocket Lab can support more than 130 launch opportunities every year delivering flexibility for rapid responsive launch for government and commercial satellite operators.”

Back to the Moon

SpaceX is also interested in launching satellites as well as taking humans to the moon.

The company founded by Elon Musk in 2002 received an updated contract in November from NASA to develop a lunar lander capable of carrying astronauts between lunar orbit and the surface of the moon as part of NASA’s Artemis III mission according to a posting at the SpaceX website. The company will now support a second human landing demonstration as part of the Artemis IV mission.

“Additionally SpaceX will demonstrate Starship’s capability to dock with Gateway a small space station that will orbit the moon in efforts to support both lunar and deep-space exploration accommodate four crew members and deliver more supplies equipment and science payloads that are needed for extensive surface explorations.” the website’s posting added.

According to the aerospace report from the LAEDC California has many attributes that the industry continues to draw on.

These include ideal climate conditions for flight-testing large restricted airspace a deep labor pool fed by numerous colleges and universities and an emerging startup scene.

Still aerospace employment in the state is less than half of what it was in 1990 due to the end of the Cold War. But a loss of employment does not imply a dying industry the report said.

While experiencing significant declines in employment the aerospace industry has maintained its sales and revenue the report found. This comes from innovation and advancements in technology and increases in productivity efficiency and automation the report added.

“Once home to numerous facilities manufacturing conventional airplanes today the majority of growth in the industry lies in drone development and space-related technologies” the report said.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vc2Z2YmouY29tL3NwZWNpYWwtcmVwb3J0L2Flcm9zcGFjZS1yb2NrZXQtZW5naW5lcy1maWdodGVyLWpldHMtYW5kLWRyb25lcy1hcmUtdml0YWwtdG8tdGhlLXZhbGxleS1lY29ub215L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Aerospace: Rocket Engines Fighter Jets and Drones are Vital to the Valley Economy,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vc2Z2YmouY29tL3NwZWNpYWwtcmVwb3J0L2Flcm9zcGFjZS1yb2NrZXQtZW5naW5lcy1maWdodGVyLWpldHMtYW5kLWRyb25lcy1hcmUtdml0YWwtdG8tdGhlLXZhbGxleS1lY29ub215L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E5D9A830>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The Obama administration approved U.S. educational and people-to-people travel to Cuba in 2015 but a U.S. federal judge in Florida last week ordered four major cruise lines to pay more than $400 million in damages plus legal fees to a U.S. company that ran the port in Havana until it was confiscated after the Cuban revolution of 1959.

U.S. District Judge Beth Bloom in the Southern District of Florida ordered Carnival MSC Royal Caribbean and Norwegian to pay representatives of the American company Havana Docks more than $400 million in damages plus legal fees according to a Miami Herald story

For example the judge awarded Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings nearly $110 million in damages including $27 million in interest plus $2.8 million in attorneys fees.

U.S. cruise ships in 2016 began traveling to Cuba for the first time in decades following a new cooperative agreement negotiated by Obama lifting some restrictions of a U.S. embargo in place since the Cold War.

In 2019 the Trump administration ordered such cruises to cease as part of efforts to pressure Cuba which at the time was supporting a D.C. nemesis Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Trump also permitted U.S. citizens to sue third parties for using property seized by Cuban authorities part of the Helms-Burton Act that had been waived by every previous president since the law’s 1996 passage.

Havana Docks said Cuba never compensated it for the takeover of the property.

The Miami Herald said the cruise lines took in at least $1.1 billion in revenue and paid entities affiliated with the Cuban government after paying the Cuban government $138 million to offer not-so-educational-sounding experiences such as lessons in making cocktails and tours of the famed Tropicana cabaret.

The decision which will likely be appealed by one or more of the defendants could have significant implications for the bevy of airlines and cruise lines that did business in Cuba when the Obama administration opened tourism on a limited basis after decades of a shutdown from 2015 to 2019.

“Carnival Corporation engaged in lawful travel explicitly licensed authorized and encouraged by the U.S. government” the Miami Herald quoted a Carnival spokesperson as saying. “We strongly disagree with both the ruling and judgment and plan to appeal these decisions.”

The federal judge held that the cruise lines engaged in illegal trafficking activities by conducting commerce through properties that were wrongly confiscated and without compensation. Cuban Americans and others have long sought compensation for seized properties and businesses.

A provision in a U.S. law enacted in 1996 allowed lawsuits against companies that benefitted from commerce involving confiscated properties in Cuba but U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton George W. Bush and Obama suspended it — a string that President Trump broke in 2019 when it was enacted again.

That led to numerous lawsuits including the one against the cruise lines involving Havana Docks seeking compensation for confiscated property in Cuba.

Last week was a fresh look at the AMD Radeon graphics/gaming performance between Windows and Linux using the very latest drivers. Today the testing wrapped up from some holiday benchmarking looking at the NVIDIA GeForce performance under Windows 11 and Ubuntu 22.10 Linux for how the drivers on both operating systems are currently competing.

This round of testing was using the latest NVIDIA drivers on each platform: NVIDIA 527.56 on Windows 11 Pro and the NVIDIA 525.60.11 Linux driver running on Ubuntu 22.10. The same system was used throughout testing with the Intel Core i9 13900K ""Raptor Lake"" processor ASUS PRIME Z790-P WIFI 2 x 16GB DDR5-6000 Corsair memory 2TB Solidigm P44 Pro NVMe SSD and the graphics cards under test.

For this testing the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 and RTX 3090 Founder's Edition cards were tested on each OS. Unfortunately NVIDIA has yet to supply any GeForce RTX 40 series hardware for Linux testing so those newest Ada Lovelace graphics cards have yet to be tested by me for Linux compatibility/performance.



There were less game compatibility headaches this round with the NVIDIA driver testing but not quite perfect.

In addition to a variety of games and graphics benchmarks under both Windows 11 and Ubuntu Linux a number of GPGPU/compute benchmarks follow in this article like the Blender 3.4 rendering performance under each OS and some OpenCL benchmarks. Thanks to no headaches over game compatibility problems or driver issues this comparison also features a larger assortment of Steam Play titles than in last week's Radeon comparison.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9ob3ctdG8tcm9sbC1iYWNrLW52aWRpYS1kcml2ZXJzL9IBTGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmRpZ2l0YWx0cmVuZHMuY29tL2NvbXB1dGluZy9ob3ctdG8tcm9sbC1iYWNrLW52aWRpYS1kcml2ZXJzLz9hbXA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,How to roll back Nvidia drivers,"New graphics drivers usually mean better performance and improved stability but not always. If you've hit an issue following a recent update you'll want to roll back your drivers to ensure your PC is back in working condition again.

You don't even need to download any kind of applications although if you really want to clear out the old/new drivers and replace them with another there are third-party driver cleaners that do an excellent job.

How to rollback Nvidia drivers with Device Manager

Nvidia's GeForce Experience might make it easy to update your GPU drivers and to reinstall them but it doesn't have any kind of way to roll them back to a previous version. For that we can use Windows 10 and 11's Device Manager.

Step 1: Use Windows search to look for Device Manager and select the corresponding result.

Step 2: Look for the icon called Display Adapters in the list of components and select the arrow next to it or double-click it. It should then show your graphics card or chip in the drop-down.

Step 3: Right-click or tap and hold on the GPU and select Properties.

Step 4: Select the Driver tab at the top of the new Window that opens.

Step 5: Select Roll Back Driver.

Step 6: Choose a reason why you are rolling back and select Yes. Then wait for the rollback to complete.

Note: Your screen may turn black once or twice during the process. Just wait a minute or so and you should see your driver date and driver version change to the previous driver you installed.

How to roll back your Nvidia drivers with DDU

If you're upgrading your graphics cards — especially if you're switching to a different brand of GPU — or if you just want to really make sure there is nothing of the old driver remaining you need to use an application called Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU).

Step 1: Download DDU from the official website and extract the archive download to a new folder.

Step 2: Optional: The official instructions for DDU suggest you reboot into Safe Mode before continuing. You don't technically have to but you probably should. Here's how to boot in safe mode in Windows 11 and how to boot to safe mode in Windows 10.

Step 3: Run the DDU application. If Windows tries to tell you it's unsafe proceed to run it anyway. If you're concerned run an antivirus scan on the .exe file beforehand.

Step 4: Close the options menu when it appears. The default settings are fine.

Step 5: Select the drop-down menu on the right that reads ""-Select device type-"" and choose Nvidia.

Step 6: From the options in the top-left select Clean and restart.

Step 7: Let DDU run to complete the uninstall (you can follow along with its log) and when given the chance allow or encourage the system to reboot by making any relevant on-screen selections.

Step 8: When Windows starts back up again open your favorite web browser and download the Nvidia drivers you want to roll back to from the official website. Then install them like you would any other driver.

Now that you have your drivers updated how you want them why don't you check out our guide to the best Nvidia Control Panel settings to maximize your GPU performance.

Editors' Recommendations",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvb2wuY29tL2ludmVzdGluZy8yMDIzLzAxLzAyLzMtcmVhc29ucy1udmlkaWEtc3RvY2stY291bGQtc3VyZ2UtaW4tMjAyMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,3 Reasons Nvidia Stock Could Surge in 2023,"Macro concerns should abate while positive long-term trends should persist.

Nvidia's (NVDA 1.27%) shares were cut in half in 2022. Like many tech stocks the semiconductor titan saw its growth slowed by inflation concerns and fears of a potential recession which drove consumers and businesses to pare back their spending on technology.

But while the economic environment is likely to remain challenging in the coming months Nvidia's long-term prospects are tantalizing. Here's why the chipmaker's stock price appears set to rebound in the years ahead.

1. A massive market opportunity

Nvidia is a leader in accelerated computing. Its graphics processing units (GPUs) excel at rapidly processing large amounts of data. It combines these high-performance chips with specialized software to further speed up applications. Nvidia's accelerated computing systems in turn are powering some of the biggest trends in tech such as cloud computing artificial intelligence (AI) and the metaverse.

Nvidia's technology helps its customers better process and filter their data. It improves their image rendering and speech recognition capabilities as well as their product recommendation engines. It can also be used to create virtual replicas of real-world items thereby allowing customers to run simulations quickly and cost-effectively.

With so many use cases Nvidia's leadership pegs its total addressable market at a staggering $1 trillion dollars. With $28.6 billion in revenue over the trailing 12 months the tech giant still has tremendous room for long-term growth.

2. Cloud-fueled gains

Nvidia's data center business represents one of its largest expansion opportunities. All the largest cloud infrastructure providers deploy Nvidia's chips in their data centers. With more businesses shifting their processes to the cloud every day due in part to cloud computing's cost security and reliability benefits demand for Nvidia's chips should rise steadily over time.

Nvidia's data center operations are already huge by most standards with more than $10 billion in revenue in fiscal 2022 which ended on Jan. 30. They're also growing rapidly. Nvidia's data center sales surged 31% year over year to $3.8 billion in its fiscal third quarter ended Oct. 30.

With the global cloud computing market set to surpass $1.2 trillion by 2027 up from $545.8 billion in 2022 according to research firm MarketsandMarkets Nvidia's booming data center business is poised to become even larger in the coming years.

3. The gaming market should rebound

Nvidia's gaming business has stalled in recent quarters coinciding with a downturn in the personal computer (PC) market. Yet these issues are likely to prove temporary.

The gaming market has grown to become an enormous global industry. There are now more than 3 billion gamers across the world up from 2.3 billion in 2017 according to Nvidia. This figure is likely to continue to rise in the coming decade as internet penetration rates increase and poverty rates decline.

Moreover each successive generation tends to have a greater percentage of gamers who also spend more time playing games. The gap has widened significantly over time with members of Gen Z playing for over seven hours per week on average compared to two hours and 30 minutes for Baby Boomers.

Partnerships with leading game console makers such as the one Nvidia struck with Nintendo to supply chips for its popular Switch gaming system have positioned the chipmaker to profit handsomely from the gaming industry's growth. And with Nintendo rumored to be gearing up to launch a new Switch device as early as the first half of 2023 Nvidia's gaming-related sales could be about to receive a boost.

Nvidia is also the dominant provider of high-end graphics cards for the PC gaming market with an 88% share according to Jon Peddie Research. Its ray tracing technology which can be used to produce incredible visual effects in games is the most advanced on the market making Nvidia's chips popular among developers and gamers alike. Thus any upturn in the PC gaming market -- which based on long-term trends is likely to occur in the near future -- should also bolster Nvidia's sales and profits.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXIuY29tL252aWRpYXMtbmV3LXJ0eC0zMDUwcy1jb21lLXdpdGgtYW4tZXZlbi1sb3dlci10ZHAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Nvidia's new RTX 3050s come with an even lower TDP,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.pcgamer.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /nvidias-new-rtx-3050s-come-with-an-even-lower-tdp/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E430FDC0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBjZ2FtZXIuY29tL252aWRpYXMtbmV3LXJ0eC0zMDUwcy1jb21lLXdpdGgtYW4tZXZlbi1sb3dlci10ZHAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiYGh0dHBzOi8vdmlkZW9jYXJkei5jb20vbmV3ei9udmlkaWEtZ2Vmb3JjZS1ydHgtNDA3MC10aS1vZmZpY2lhbGx5LWNvc3RzLTc5OS1sYXVuY2hlcy1qYW51YXJ5LTV0aNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 Ti officially costs $799 launches January 5th,"NVIDIA lowers the price of AD104-400 desktop GPU

The RTX 4070 Ti a rebranded RTX 4080 12GB will launch at $799.

We now have a confirmation on GeForce RTX 4070 Ti price the card will be $400 cheaper than RTX 4080.

According to the official slide from tomorrow’s presentation the RTX 4070 Ti is to offer 40 TFLOPs of single precision compute performance at $799. This is the MSRP for the card that will launch only as a partner card with no Founders Edition planned.

NVIDIA confirms that RTX 4070 Ti is ‘faster than RTX 3090 Ti’ but the slide does not really explain how. The leaked 3DMark performance figures may give us a hint though. The card is based on Ada Lovelace architecture and it is a third GPU to support DLSS3 upscaling tech.

The RTX 4070 Ti features full AD104 GPU with 7680 CUDA cores. This card is equipped with 12GB of GDDR6X memory and it is rated for 285W TDP as per official specs. These are indeed the same specifications as the GeForce RTX 4080 12GB GPU before it was cancelled by NVIDIA.

NVIDIA confirms that RTX 4070 Ti will be available starting from January 5th. The company is to announce the card at CES 2023 presentation which starts in less than 24 hours."

This past year will likely go down as a turning point in the energy sector. After years of underperformance energy stocks soared in 2022. While higher energy prices played a key role an even more significant catalyst was energy security becoming a top priority for most countries following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The fallout of that ongoing conflict will likely have a major impact on the sector this year.

No one knows exactly how 2023 will play out. However I will try my luck by making a few bold predictions about what I believe we'll see in the oil patch in the coming year.

Oil prices top triple digits again

Last year I boldly predicted that oil prices would remain high and could top $100 a barrel again. With supplies still tight coming out of the pandemic and demand recovering the stage appeared set for a potential major spike in crude prices if there was a supply disruption. That's exactly what happened following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Another bull market is coming for oil in 2023. Supplies remain constrained because oil companies continue to be cautious about investing in expanding their output. In addition there's a lot of uncertainty about Russia's supply. It recently banned oil exports to countries that implemented a price cap on its oil in response to its ongoing war with Ukraine. Finally the U.S. has stopped drawing down its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR).

Meanwhile on the demand side China appears poised to reopen its economy fully. There could be enormous pent-up demand from that country. While a global economic slowdown could affect demand the continuing return to normal following the pandemic could keep consumption elevated.

All these signs point to higher oil prices in 2023 with many Wall Street analysts expecting crude to top $100 by midyear. I agree.

Carbon capture will become one of the hottest investment trends in 2023

While climate change remains a top concern for global governments energy security has become an equally important priority. That's leading countries to seek out solutions to both problems. One that's emerging as a potential game changer is carbon capture and sequestration (CCS). The technology captures carbon dioxide and sequesters it underground. As a result it reduces the emissions profile of fossil fuels.

Oil companies believe CCS represents a multitrillion-dollar commercial opportunity. Because of that oil giants like Chevron (CVX 0.22%) Exxon (XOM -0.41%) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY -1.04%) are investing heavily in CCS technology and projects.

I believe 2023 will mark an inflection point for CCS. We'll see more countries and companies get on board with the idea that CCS can become a significant part of the solution to climate change. That should drive considerable investment in the sector. It should also buoy the stock prices of energy companies that are first movers in the space like Occidental Petroleum which has plans to develop 100 direct air capture facilities for CCS around the world in the coming years.

The next wave of LNG projects starts construction

Another fuel that can be a solution to the world's energy security and emissions problems is liquefied natural gas (LNG). Natural gas is abundant in certain parts of the world and has a lower emissions profile than oil and coal (it can even become net zero through CCS). Because of that it could become the key to solving Europe's energy crisis now that Russia has reduced its gas supplies to the continent.

According to ExxonMobil the fuel is in short supply. That's why we'll see several LNG export facilities reach positive final investment decisions in the coming year. There are many in the pipeline including projects supported by Energy Transfer (ET 0.17%) Devon Energy (DVN -1.44%) and ConocoPhillips (COP -0.57%). Energy Transfer has been working on its Lake Charles LNG project for years. The midstream company should finally approve that project in 2023 which could significantly boost its valuation and long-term growth outlook.

The oil industry's future will become clearer in 2023

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has dramatically altered the oil market's long-term outlook. Along with other catalysts that war will likely keep oil prices elevated in 2023. As a result energy security will remain a priority driving a new wave of LNG investments. CCS will also emerge as a viable long-term solution to extend the life of the fossil fuels sector. Given this outlook I expect oil stocks to do well again in 2023 especially those with CCS and LNG projects in the pipeline.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8va2V5dC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlLzIwMjMvMDEvMDEvc2FudGEtYmFyYmFyYS1jb3VudHktZmlyZWZpZ2h0ZXJzLXJlc3BvbmQtdG8tb2lsLWxlYWstbm9ydGgtb2YtY2FycGludGVyaWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Santa Barbara County firefighters respond to oil leak north of Carpinteria,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8va2V5dC5jb20vbGlmZXN0eWxlLzIwMjMvMDEvMDEvc2FudGEtYmFyYmFyYS1jb3VudHktZmlyZWZpZ2h0ZXJzLXJlc3BvbmQtdG8tb2lsLWxlYWstbm9ydGgtb2YtY2FycGludGVyaWEv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3681750>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

So when he offered up a tour name idea to Old Dominion they jumped on it.

""The name of our tour is No Bad Vibes Tour and it got named by Kenny"" the band told Taste of Country ahead of the 2022 CMA Awards in November.

The moment came when Old Dominion was opening for Chesney on his Here and Now Tour earlier this year. The band was planning a tour for 2023 but hadn't settled on a name. One day in a hallway backstage Chesney asked if they had named their tour. After telling him that they hadn't he offered up ""No Bad Vibes.""

The band is familiar with the phrase after using it in the lyrics for their song ""No Hard Feelings."" Old Dominion also sell flags that read ""No Bad Vibes.""

They all agreed that the name was perfect for their upcoming trek.

The No Bad Vibes Tour kicks off Jan. 19 in Evansville Ind. and will continue through June 30 when it wraps in Lake Tahoe Nev. The tour includes dates in Canada.

Kassi Ashton Frank Ray and Greylan James will open the U.S. dates with Ray and Shawn Austin covering the Canada shows.

""At an Old Dominion show I think we just want people to feel happy"" frontman Matthew Ramsey explains in a press release. ""They should feel like they got to forget about whatever is bothering them or whatever's weighing them down at that point in time. Just come and hang out with us and escape for a couple hours.

On the contrary: for states like Virginia it’s always election season.

In 2023 Virginia will hold state Senate and House of Delegates elections to elect lawmakers to all 140 General Assembly seats; the upper chamber has 40 seats the lower has 100. The primary is scheduled for June 20 2023 and the general election will occur on Nov. 7 2023.

The Old Dominion is one of the few states that hold these “off-year” elections. But why?

As WAMU’s Martin Austermuhle writes is Virginia specifically purposely trying to cut against the grain? Or did legislators pick this election schedule because it’s objectively better than aligning with presidential or congressional contests?

To learn why one has to go all the way back to the 19th century when Virginians first gained the right to directly elect a governor through the 1851 constitution. And they continued to do just that in 1855 1859 and 1863. After that the Civil War interrupted the normal course of many things including elections and in late 1867 and early 1868 a constitutional convention gathered to write a new state constitution as part of Reconstruction. That constitution was scheduled to be ratified in 1868 but for a variety of reasons as Brent Tarter a retired senior editor and historian at the Library of Virginia says the ratification referendum and the associated general election got put off until the summer of 1869.

“At that time voters ratified the constitution and elected a governor and that set in train the four-year cycle for Virginia governors” Tarter tells WAMU. “And ever since then we’ve elected the governor in the year after a presidential election.” This off-year cycle applied to elections for Virginia’s Senate and House of Delegates as well.

Austermuhle goes on to say that while Virginia’s election schedule may have been a simple accident of history but keeping it that way certainly hasn’t been. Many historians and political analysts believe Virginia’s election schedule has worked to benefit incumbent politicians and “political machines” that have traditionally been resistant to change in the state. The most notorious of these machines in the Old Dominion was that of Harry F. Byrd.

The longtime leader of Virginia’s Democratic Party and the commonwealth’s governor from 1926 to 1930 Byrd worked with Democrats of the time to write a new constitution in 1902 that severely limited voting in Virginia — and virtually eliminated Black voters from the franchise. Consequently throughout the first half of the 20th century Virginia had some of the lowest voter turnout rates in the country.

It wasn’t until 1971 that Virginia adopted a new constitution and eliminated many of these voting restrictions. One thing that stuck though was the off-year elections. Old habits die hard as they say. And there are some who think this schedule works to benefit Virginia’s voters: as Tarter notes “it keeps controversial presidential candidates or controversial national issues from influencing elections that ought to be on state candidates and state issues.” But as Geoffrey Skelley a senior elections analyst at FiveThirtyEight points out this schedule can also work against local politics since the commonwealth’s gubernatorial election is now regularly seen as a test for how well–or not–a president and their party are doing. The same goes for state Senate and House of Delegates elections.

There’s another big issue with Virginia’s election schedule: turnout. While various voting reforms have boosted electoral participation in recent years turnout rates still remain comparatively low for these off-year elections.

“Virginia Louisiana and New Jersey changed their state elections to off years at times when their state leadership whether Democrat- or Republican-controlled was concerned that a changing national political climate would throw them out of power” voting advocacy group Democracy Docket notes. “No matter the popularity of the current president state leaders wanted to avoid running their local elections on the presidential or congressional midterm tickets so they moved their election years.”

Off-year elections impact turnout in a number of ways. First even though Virginia’s elections have been on this schedule for decades it’s still harder to raise voter awareness in a year without presidential or congressional races on the ballot. This often means that certain voters make up a disproportionate amount of the electorate: older whiter wealthier and more conservative.

And the numbers back this up: in the last Virginia off-year election in 2021 54.9% of the electorate came out to vote. During the 2020 presidential election 75.08% of the electorate voted. As Democracy Docket stresses high voter turnout is vital to a healthy democracy especially if low turnout means that the electorate is not representative of the population as a whole.

Voter turnout especially matters when issues such as the reproductive rights of Virginians are on the line. What the historically lower numbers mean for 2023’s election remains to be seen."

While not naming any specific semiconductor firms he provided two hints about future acquisition targets. First the companies that operate in electromobility autonomous driving renewable energy data centers and the Internet of Things (IoT). Second startups that need to be sufficiently well financed and want to join a corporation.

Infineon has recently completed two successful acquisitions. First it snapped International Rectifier for $3 billion in 2014 to complement its automotive semiconductor offerings. Next in 2019 Infineon acquired Cypress Semiconductor for $10 billion to bolster its presence in IoT silicon.

The news about Infineon being ready to spend billions on semiconductor acquisitions comes at a time when some industry analysts forecaste a decline in chip market growth in 2023. On the other hand Infineon is tying its acquisition plans to boost growth in power sensors and artificial intelligence (AI). It’s important to note that this corporate move syncs with its earlier announcement to build a fab in Dresden to expand 300-mm capacity.

German chipmaker’s ambitions for semiconductor industry acquisitions is also an important development in the backdrop of two critical issues that seem to cloud semiconductor industry prospects in 2023. First and foremost there is a forecast for a decline in capital spending on semiconductor production equipment. Second the U.S. semiconductor export sanctions on electronics companies in China could significantly impact chip sales.

The semiconductor industry is starting 2023 with conflicting signals. There is good news and not-so-good news. But the fact that the U.S. Chips Act will start to take shape this year and there is talk about the European Chips Act amounting to 15 billion euros tilt the balance toward a vibrant year for the chips industry.

The competition between the U.S and China becomes intense for the chip. Semiconductor is an integral part of the electronic and military industry. What are causes behind this war what is the current situation what will be the implications in the future and who will win this war is going to be discussed in this article.

Semiconductors also known as chips are the materials that have a conductivity between conductors and insulators. The semiconductors can be consisted of pure elements such as germanium or silicon. Semiconductors use in electronic equipments and devices including diodes transistors integrated circuits consumer products like mobile phones laptops game consoles microwaves cars. Now it is considered as “The new oil” and ” A 21st century horse shoe nail.” Moreover semiconductors is the core component in the manufacturing industries. The U.S.A Asian countries like Taiwan China South Korea and Japan are the largest semiconductor producers in the world. Taiwan China South Korea’s companies account for 87% of the global market. Supply chain uncertainty Covid-19 pandemic the increasing demand of consumers that lead to the world in semiconductor war. Especially the COVID-19 pandemic played a massive and dimension role in this crisis. Industries were failed to meet the supply and demand of the consumer in that climate semiconductors companies were lagged behind and unstable to cope with the severe demand pressure from various sectors. According to the semiconductor Industry Association the global semiconductor sales were hoped to be maximized by 20% in 2021. As demand for consumer electronics decreased the paucity of advanced elements waned rapidly. Hence the industry is now dealing with intense stock. The automotive chip insufficiency is now struggling to protect the unwavering supplies of chips. In 2022 they were predicted to rise 9%. The declining of semiconductors production will help to lead the production process of the electronic industries in 2023. By the end of the 2027 silicon market is expected to reach USD70 billion and annual growth rate of 5.1% over the next five years.

The United States of America is the semiconductors race leader in the worldwide market whose market share value was at over $200 billion in 2020. They are also a harbinger in the export of semiconductors 50% of the world market.Basically semiconductors are the top export goods of the United States of America and they invest more than one-fifth of the sales on research and advancement second only the pharmaceutical business. America still depends on Taiwan for exporting semiconductors. On the other hand China is now an emerging major participant in the semiconductor race. Its semiconductor industry has been expanding since 2015. The Semiconductor Industry Association hopes China to excel Taiwan by 2030 with a 24% market share and supported by its ” Made in China 2025″ initiative. China has already devoured Taiwan in the semiconductor business during the previous two years. America always wants to halt China but China’s semiconductor industry continuous to advance at the 9% its annual sales might reach $114 billion by 2024. In order to Taiwan’s geopolitical kismet precarious both America and China are racing to make their own malignance as well as self-contained in the semiconductor industry. China works for long to catch up America’s advanced technologies and competes in microchip. The rise of techno-nationalism in china will lead to both the competition and conflict with the U.S.

The U.S has recently passed the CHIPS Act that involve Impressive financial support for science and technology because their main goal is to maintain a magnificent competitive benefits over China. The most panorama controls on chip imitation the U.S Department of commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) implements. On October 2022 the Biden Administration amplified its controls on the exports of semiconductors associated inputs and equipments to China. On December 6 Biden visited the site of Taiwan semiconductor Manufacturing Co. new plant in Arizona and called a potential project for the U.S chip supply chain.In mid December The U.S administration included 36 additional Chinese chip makers from entrancing U.S chip technology including YMTC. Not only 40Billion investment delineates the U.S endeavors to attain hegemon over China in chip industry but also America has stepped to strength entrance to flourished semiconductors technology by Chinese companies. It is now crystalline that America has announced a semiconductor war on China.

Now it is a question of trillion dollars who will win the chip war? Chip war is now a war more than the geopolitical conflict. It is very difficult to determine the winner of the chip war. As the U.S is the global hegemon some countries will try to make a coalition with the U.S and its allies. The U.S will dominate the semiconductors technology for artificial intelligence and military installation. China takes the conduct in microelectronics like cloud computing and electronic devices. According to some Economists there will be no winner only losers will remain. And the ultimate losers are the consumers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiSWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbW1vYmlsZS5jb20vbmV3cy9zYW1zdW5nLXNlbWljb25kdWN0b3ItcHJvZml0cy0yMDIzLWhhbHZlZC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung expects profits from semiconductor business to be halved in 2023,"Samsung's Device Solutions (DS) division which operates Samsung Foundry System LSI and Memory Division is expecting its operating profit in 2023 to be around KRW 13.1 trillion reports South Korean publication The Elec. Reportedly the figure was shared by the company in a note sent to its employees on Wednesday.

While 2023 is looking bad for Samsung 2024 could turn things around

If the prediction turns out to be true Samsung's annual operating profit from the semiconductor business in 2023 will be half of what analysts predict it to be in this year which is around KRW 26 trillion. The significant drop in the operating profit will be a direct result of the ongoing down cycle in the chip industry.

Reportedly Samsung's MX division will not use Exynos SoCs in the company's flagship phones anymore which could also be why 2023's predictions for the DS division look bad. While 2023 is looking bad for Samsung analysts predict the chip market to improve in 2024 and that’s when things could start looking better as the company is expected to get the contract to manufacture Google's Tensor G3 processor and Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset on its 3nm GAA node.

Samsung employees will get lower bonuses in 2024

Samsung pays performance incentives to its employees at the beginning of a year based on the employee's performance last year. This bonus is paid from the profits exceeding the company's target for the prior year. Up to 20% of surplus profits are used to pay bonuses and employees can get up to 50% of their annual salary as a performance incentive.

Since performance incentives are based on the company's operating profit Samsung has to share those figures with its employees along with predictions for the next year so that they know what to expect in the future. The note regarding bonuses that the company shared this year mentions the operating profit to be around KRW 13.1 trillion in 2023.

If Samsung's DS division meets its expected operating profit in 2023 employees will get a bonus between 5% and 11% in January 2024. For employees to get the maximum bonus which is 50% Samsung needs to achieve an operating profit of KRW 28 trillion which is impossible given the current crisis in the semiconductor market.

Profits from the smartphone division are also expected to drop in 2023

Samsung has also recorded lower operating profits from the DX and MX divisions in Q3 2022 due to increasing component prices. The Galaxy S23 will use even costlier components but Samsung will reportedly offer it for the same price as the Galaxy S22 and that means the mobile division will also see lower profits in 2023.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicmh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL0J1c2luZXNzL1RlY2hub2xvZ3kvSmFwYW4tcy1Ub2hva3UtVW5pdmVyc2l0eS1ncm93cy1hcy1kcmVhbS1sb2NhdGlvbi1mb3ItY2hpcC1yZXNlYXJjaGVyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Japan's Tohoku University grows as dream location for chip researchers,"TOKYO -- Located in northeastern Japan Tohoku University is one of the oldest national universities in the country and with its well-known mottos of ""research first"" and ""open-door policy"" -- it was the first national university in Japan to accept female students -- it has long stood in high regard.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by March of this year it plans to issue proposed rules and final regulations by the end of 2023 covering heavy-duty trucks through at least the 2030 model year.

With the new rules expected to significantly reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from heavy-duty diesel engines and put in place more stringent GHG standards for certain commercial vehicles manufacturers are already looking ahead.

“There is no one solution or silver bullet when meeting GHG requirements” said Duane Tegels​ product marketing manager–powertrain / VHD VNX VAH at Volvo. “As we transition into new more stringent emissions standards the focus pivots from the engine to the entire powertrain using both torque and horsepower in the right way and time. While reducing unnecessary parasitic losses that also includes aligning shift strategies and selecting proper gearing to meet efficiency goals.”

Chet Ciesielski vice president On-Highway Heavy Duty Truck Business at Navistar said to meet increasingly stringent GHG emissions requirements it is critical to think outside of just the engine itself. That focus for the OEM has been on a modular powertrain solution for the North American market that includes the engine transmission and the aftertreatment system.

“Each component of this powertrain was developed concurrently from the ground up to ensure maximized efficiency between all systems” Ciesielski stated. “The integrated design approach allows each component to do what it does best and deliver achievements in fuel efficiency and a reduction in emissions.”

Puneet Jhawar general manager–Global Spark Ignited Business at Cummins noted that while minimized product changes are needed to be compliant with 2024 GHG regulations with each change engines are cleaner. “By working on technologies and architectures to meet the stringent regulations we can continue delivering the most reliable and efficient products” he said.

“Each of our product development programs spends years testing and validating these designs to deliver on long-term GHG standards” Jhawar added. “Technology has increased our capability for modelling simulating data that helps us be more resourceful in our testing.”

New products and solutions

The International S13 Integrated Powertrain from Navistar is designed with dual-stage SCR as its primary NOx emissions reduction technology. With no EGR cooler on the engine 100 percent of the exhaust flows to the turbocharger during normal operating conditions. That leads to less soot and particulate matter (PM) generation which also supports extending DPF service intervals.

In addition to hardware improvements software in the S13 Integrated Powertrain is designed to optimize operation. For example the engine and transmission communicate on a proprietary CAN network separate from the J1939 public data link. That set up eliminates the possibility of other components on the data link interrupting communications including those that optimize shift strategies.

Volvo’s solution to this challenge is I-Torque a blend of powertrain components including the OEM’s D13 turbo compounding engine 13-speed transmission and ratios ranging from 2.15 to 2.17. To assist the transmission electronic control module with when to shift Volvo uses I-SEE which defines topography before a truck ascends or descends over terrain.

I-See allows the drivetrain to disengage from the engine during descent (when in cruise) increasing the truck’s roll window and therefore its efficiency. It also proactively downshifts before climbing a hill managing the truck’s momentum for a faster and more efficient ascent.

At Cummins the focus on GHG reduction has been on the development of fuel agnostic platforms. The common base architecture incorporates different heads to accommodate multiple fuel types including diesel natural gas and hydrogen.

The first Cummins product in the planned series will be a 15-liter heavy-duty natural gas engine for 2024. The big-bore model which uses low carbon fuel resulting in fuel economy and greenhouse gas improvements will be capable of similar ratings and performance as its diesel counterpart.

“The path to a sustainable future requires continued improvements in existing technology at the same time as we develop new technologies” said Chet Ciesielski at Navistar. “We understand that the transition to zero emissions will not happen overnight and that we must provide customers with increasingly more efficient solutions.”",,,,,,,,,

This democratization of ransomware is bad news for organizations because it also brought in a diversification of tactics techniques and procedures (TTPs) more indicators of compromise (IOCs) to track and potentially more hurdles to jump through when trying to negotiate or pay ransoms.

“We can likely date the accelerated landscape changes back to at least mid-2021 when the Colonial Pipeline DarkSide ransomware attack and subsequent law enforcement takedown of REvil led to the dispersal of several ransomware partnerships” researchers from Cisco’s Talos group said in their annual report. “Fast forward to this year when the ransomware scene seems as dynamic as ever with various groups adapting to increased disruptive efforts by law enforcement and private industry infighting and insider threats and a competitive market that has developers and operators shifting their affiliation continuously in search of the most lucrative ransomware operation.”

Large ransomware groups attract too much attention

Since 2019 the ransomware landscape has been dominated by big and professionalized ransomware operations that constantly made the news headlines and even looked for media attention to gain legitimacy with potential victims.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The sci-fi film generated $63.4 million in domestic ticket sales over the first three days of New Year’s weekend according to an estimate from Disney on Sunday. It has made $1.38 billion worldwide since its release on Dec. 16.

That puts Disney’s film on track to surpass the $1.49 billion in sales for Paramount Global’s Top Gun: Maverick the current highest-grossing film released in 2022. Both studios have some bragging rights. The Tom Cruise fighter-jet movie made the most money at domestic theaters within the year while The Way of Water tops it internationally.

The weekend performance demonstrates the unusual staying power of the Avatar franchise. The Way of Water didn’t even have one of the top three domestic openings of 2022. Its 2009 predecessor Avatar also started out slowly but ultimately sold a record $2.92 billion worth of tickets.

Visual effects and the use of novel 3D-viewing technologies have been a selling point for both movies. Avatar films incorporate the real-life movements of actors playing members of an indigenous Na’vi humanoid race into on-screen animation. The use of the tech helped make the movies some of the most expensive ever produced.

The Way of Water is probably on course to at least break even financially an accomplishment given its high production costs. That bodes well for a series of sequels Disney has planned for the franchise through 2028. The Burbank California entertainment giant acquired the rights to the James Cameron films as part of a $71 billion acquisition of 20th Century Fox in 2019.

Despite several strong performances theaters still had a bad year compared to pre-pandemic times. North American box office sales reached about $7.46 billion in 2022 far less than the $11.4 billion sales figure from 2019 Comscore estimated.

Part of the decline is because Covid-19 left movie-release schedules in such disarray they could take years to untangle. Audiences have also been conditioned to watch new films at home. The business may recover further in 2023 with installments of major franchises including Indiana Jones and Transformers planned.

THE REPORTERS' NOTEBOOK

By Nick Gallo and Paris Lawson | okcthunder.com

The Big Picture

The Thunder came into Saturday night’s New Year’s Eve contest against the Philadelphia 76ers with 26-straight games scoring at least 100 or more points the NBA's longest active streak. As the team turned the calendar to 2023 and rang in the New Year with its faithful Thunder family at Paycom Center like it does each year it was a chance to reflect on the growth the team has made and the ability to put together a streak like that which would have been unlikely the last two seasons.

After a stretch of extremely close games and clutch-time battles shootouts and scoring barrages the Thunder’s offense just didn’t have it on the final night of 2022 ending that streak. Low-scoring nights have been very rare for the Thunder this season as OKC has shown a remarkable level of consistency as the NBA's youngest team.

After a 16-4 start Philadelphia led by as many as 33 in the first half and despite a few charges by the Thunder in the second third and fourth quarters OKC couldn’t slice the lead to a smaller margin than 17. The result was a 115-96 76ers victory.

Observations

First Quarter

Paris: Josh Giddey was responsible for the Thunder’s first six points of the ball game and all of his looks came in the paint. The attacks to the basket were a continuation of the focus for Giddey to hunt more opportunities around the rim that could lead to more trips to the free throw line. In his last game against Charlotte Giddey set a new career-high with seven-made free throws.

Nick: As he’s done all season long Shai Gilgeous-Alexander turned a corner and drove downhill through the middle of the lane but instead of going to a Eurostep or a floater Shai went straight into the chest of Danuel House bullying his way to the rim for an exhilarating two-handed dunk. That was Shai’s 21st dunk of the season the second-most of his career and two shy of tying his career-high. Shai scored eight of his 14 total points in the first quarter in this one.

Second Quarter

Paris: Jalen Willians attacked the left side of the floor but instead of finishing on the left side of the rim the rookie kept his foot on the gas and finished a reverse on the opposite side. Williams was responsible for five-straight Thunder points out of a timeout and both of his baskets came off of quick-strike offensive actions. Williams went into halftime with nine points and finished the night with 17 on six of 10 shooting.

Nick: The Thunder had a nice sequence coming right out of a timeout with Kenrich Williams finishing off a second chance with a layup down low one of six rebounds Kenny Hustle racked up in the first half alone. After a turnover by Philadelphia’s Shake Milton Tre Mann stayed alert and tracked down a loose ball in the left corner and immediately hoisted it up. The makeshift catch-and-shoot 3-point look dropped and gave the Thunder a quick 5-0 burst to provide a boost as OKC tried to claw back from a big deficit.

Third Quarter

Paris: Joel Embiid sent a bad pass back out to the perimeter and the ball went flying into the backcourt. Lu Dort scorched out in a full sprint up the sideline to chase down the ball. Dort picked up the loose change and finished a layup in transition. It was the second loose ball that Dort recovered in the matchup and brought his total up to 32 loose balls recovered this season – a top-five mark in the NBA.

Nick: The Thunder doesn’t play the scoreboard it plays the next possession and one third quarter defensive sequence exemplified the type of focus and cohesion the team is looking for. After a kick-out pass by Philadelphia the Thunder executed a weakside x-out as Isaiah Joe rushed from the wing to the right corner to deny a shot attempt then Jalen Williams dashed to the right wing to close out against Georges Niang who caught the extra pass up the sideline. The result was a late shot clock contested 3-pointer that went long. Rookie Jaylin Williams making his second career NBA start and ninth overall appearance this season snapped up the rebound with authority.

Fourth Quarter

Nick: Kenrich Williams blocked Tobias Harris not once but twice on the same post up attempt at the left elbow. The Thunder made six blocks and seven steals in the contest right at its season average for steals-and-blocks combined per game. Even though the 76ers were productive on offense the Thunder dug in defensively and tried to scrap even when its offense wasn’t quite humming the way it normally does.

Paris: Coming out of a timeout with five minutes left in the fourth Mark Daingeault implemented a lineup featuring total sharpshooters with Isaiah Joe Lindy Waters III and Tre Mann. On his very first possession Waters cashed in a 3-pointer at the top of the key on a hand-off from Jaylin Williams. But 3-point shooting wasn’t the only contribution from Waters in the minutes he played on the floor – he also blocked Paul Reed on the defensive end and earned a pair of free throws after getting fouled in transition.

Quotables

“You never want to be down 30 but if you are you want to keep playing and I thought we did that tonight. Every guy the effort in the second half was there. Nobody was letting go of the rope. It just obviously was was too much to overcome because of the start. The lesson is that we don't want to give that energy in a 30 point game. We want to give that energy at the beginning of the game and give ourselves a chance. We've done that for much of the year. Tonight was a little bit of an outlier in that sense.” —Coach Daigneault

“We weren't good to start the game on both ends of the floor. I think they got a lot of open looks and boards. They made shots but our offense was too stagnant. We didn't get enough looks. We spoke pregame about getting out and making them run. We didn't do it early and we didn't do it a lot of the game. So a slow start and you can't afford that against an experienced team like Philly.” —Josh Giddey

What's Next

After ringing in the New Year at Paycom Center against the 76ers the Thunder will stay in Oklahoma City for one more game on Tuesday against the Boston Celtics at 7 p.m. That game is the front end of a home-road back-to-back with the Thunder heading east to Orlando for a game on Wednesday night.

Instead all such plaintiffs seek monetary damages based on the sales of those products.”

Substantial patent litigation activity occurred in the mRNA space in 2022 involving nearly all of the major mRNA and lipid nanoparticle (LNP) pioneers. Since this is the most significant happening in this space with respect to IP in 2022 this post will provide an overview of that activity as well as a summary exposure analysis.

Summary of 2022 Litigation Activity

On February 28 lipid pioneer Arbutus and its exclusive licensee Genevant sued mRNA pioneer Moderna in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. The complaint contains allegations that Moderna infringed U.S. Patent Nos. 8058069 8492359 8822668 9364435 9504651 and 11141378 through inter alia Moderna’s sales of its Spikevax® vaccine product. The key patents-in-suit relate to four-lipid delivery systems designed to protect fragile mRNA “payloads” post-injection and release them once inside a recipient’s cells. Moderna moved to dismiss certain claims relating to Spikevax® made and sold to the U.S. government (the motion was based on 28 U.S.C. § 1498 which requires patent-holders to seek redress from the U.S. government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims whenever an invention covered its patent “is used or manufactured by or for the United States without a license”). The court denied the motion Moderna answered the complaint on November 30 and discovery has not yet commenced.

On March 17 lipid and SiRNA pioneer Alnylam sued Moderna and Pfizer separately in the District of Delaware. The respective complaints contain allegations that of Moderna and Pfizer each infringed U.S. Patent No. 11246933 by using Alnylam’s claimed cationic lipids in their vaccine products. On July 12 2022 Alnylam filed new separate suits against Moderna and Pfizer (and this time including Pfizer’s collaborator and mRNA pioneer BioNTech) also in the District of Delaware for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 11382979 which issued the same day the suit was filed and has claims directed to lipid nanoparticles and related methods of preparation. The March and July Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech cases were each separately consolidated and discovery has commenced in each case. Similar to the Arbutus case in the Alnylam v. Moderna case Moderna moved to dismiss certain claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1498 but the court has not ruled on that motion to date.

On March 18 a day after the initial Alnylam lawsuits were filed lipid pioneer Acuitas sued Arbutus and Genevant in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York seeking a declaratory judgment that the BioNTech and Pfizer vaccine product Comirnaty® does not infringe the six Arbutus patents asserted in the Moderna case plus three other Arbutus-owned patents directed to LNPs (U.S. Patent Nos. 9006417 9404127 and 9518272) and that the subject Arbutus patents are invalid. Acuitas alleged that Comirnaty® contains “the lipids and lipid nanoparticles innovated by Acuitas” that are grounded in certain LNP-based collaborations between Acuitas and BioNTech and Pfizer. Since Acuitas has itself apparently not been accused of infringement and does not sell the Comirnaty® product one of the key early issues in this case is whether Acuitas has standing to sue. Arbutus and Genevant have moved to dismiss on these grounds; that motion is pending and discovery has not yet commenced.

Several months later on July 7 mRNA pioneer CureVac sued BioNTech (but not Pfizer) in the Regional Court of Düsseldorf Germany for infringement of one European Patent (EP1857122B1) and three German patents (DE202015009961U1 DE202021003575U1 and DE202015009974U1). CureVac has alleged that its patent portfolio “protects multiple inventions that are considered essential to the design and development of” Comirnaty® “including sequence modifications to increase stability and enhance protein expression as well as mRNA vaccine formulations specific to SARS CoV-2 vaccines.”

Within weeks of CureVac’s suit in Germany on July 25 BioNTech and Pfizer sued CureVac in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts for a declaratory judgment that the companies do not infringe CureVac’s U.S. Patent Nos. 11241493 (mRNA composition with certain lipid structures) 11135312 (method for producing a stabilized mRNA molecule) and 11149278 (method for treating/preventing infectious disease by administering a specific RNA molecule). Later around September Pfizer and BioNTech reportedly filed proceedings in the High Court of England and Wales seeking judgment that their COVID-19 vaccine does not infringe certain of CureVac’s European patents. In the U.S. case discovery has not yet commenced and CureVac has moved to dismiss or transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia which Pfizer and BioNTech oppose. That motion is pending.

Finally on August 26 Moderna sued Pfizer and BioNTech in the District of Massachusetts for infringement of U.S. Patent Nos. 10898574 (lipid nanoparticle and related method of producing a polypeptide) 10702600 (mRNA encoding a betacoronavirus S protein formulated in a lipid nanoparticle) and 10933127 (method of administering mRNA formulated in a lipid nanoparticle). Moderna indicated it also filed infringement lawsuits against Pfizer and BioNTech that same day in the Regional Court of Düsseldorf Germany. Moderna’s CEO Stéphane Bancel stated “[w]e are filing these lawsuits to protect the innovative mRNA technology platform that we pioneered invested billions of dollars in creating and patented during the decade preceding the COVID-19 pandemic.” In the U.S. case Pfizer and BioNTech answered the complaint on December 5 and discovery has not yet commenced.

Summary Exposure Analysis

Importantly none of the parties that have alleged infringement are seeking an injunction to stop the sales of Spikevax® or Comirnaty®. Instead all such plaintiffs seek monetary damages based on the sales of those products which will reportedly total over a combined $100 billion globally by the end of 2022.

Under 35 U.S.C. §284 a patent-holder may obtain damages “in no event less than a reasonable royalty” for the subject infringement. A patent-holder may also obtain compensatory damages in the form of “lost profits” in situations where it can prove (1) there is a demand for the patented product (2) the absence of acceptable non-infringing alternatives (3) it had the manufacturing and marketing capacity to exploit demand for the product and (4) the amount of profit it should have made but-for the accused product. Mentor Graphics Corp. v. EVE-USA Inc. 851 F.3d 1275 1284-85 (Fed. Cir. 2017) (reciting the Panduit factors).

With respect to the suits against Moderna none of Arbutus Genevant or Alnylam have alleged lost profit damages. That makes sense because it would be difficult for them do so (e.g. none sells products that compete with Spikevax®). Accordingly the potential exposure Moderna faces in the present cases is primarily at least a “reasonable royalty” applied against Spikevax® sales which may be enhanced if Arbutus and Genevant are successful in their willful infringement claims. See e.g. SRI Int’l. v. Cisco Sys. Inc. 14 F.4th 1323 1330 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (stating that the showing of “deliberate or intentional infringement” could establish willful infringement and form the basis of enhanced damages).

Significantly not all Spikevax® sales may be implicated in the damages calculation since for example (1) the law surrounding the availability of reasonable royalty damages awards for infringement under 35 U.S.C. §271 based on extraterritorial sales is unclear and it is possible that some foreign sales may not apply to the subject damage calculation; and (2) Spikevax® sales made to the U.S. government may not be included in the damages calculation on the basis of 28 U.S.C. § 1498 (referenced above).

For similar reasons Pfizer and BioNTech are also subject to potential exposure from the Alnylam and CureVac suits in the form of reasonable royalties on sales of Comirnaty®. With respect to lost profits (1) Alnylam is similarly situated in the Pfizer/BioNTech case as in the Moderna case in that it does not sell competing products; and (2) while CureVac is an mRNA pioneer that has a deep pipeline it does not have a competing COVID-19 vaccine on the market to date and it would therefore not have a strong lost profits case in the U.S. courts. At this time Alnylam has not alleged willful infringement against Pfizer or BioNTech or for that matter Moderna. CureVac has not yet answered the Pfizer or BioNTech complaint in the District of Massachusetts and may have opportunity to claim willfulness in such a pleading if it has a basis to do so.

It is possible that Pfizer and BioNTech will also be sued by Arbutus and Genevant which according to the Acuitas complaint have already sent “demand” letters to Pfizer in 2020 and 2021. The declaratory judgment lawsuit filed by Acuitas may therefore have been a preemptive attack by the Pfizer partner and alleged developer of Comirnaty® LNPs. Perhaps if the Acuitas suit survives the pending motion to dismiss for lack of standing Arbutus and Genevant will add infringement counterclaims against Pfizer and BioNTech bringing them into that suit. Or if Arbutus and Genevant are successful with their motion to dismiss they may file a separate patent infringement lawsuit against Pfizer and BioNTech. It is also possible of course that no suit is filed against Pfizer or BioNTech and that the parties resolve any disputes without the need for litigation.

Returning to Moderna its suit against Pfizer and BioNTech is interesting for a number of reasons. First Moderna is seeking “compensatory damages including reasonable royalties and/or lost profit damages.” See e.g. Complaint ¶119 (emphasis added). Moderna is also seeking damages for willful infringement which could form the basis for enhanced damages. Id. at ¶118. Moderna has also stated that it “is not seeking damages related to Pfizer’s sales to AMC 92 [low- and middle-income countries] countries and is not seeking damages for Pfizer’s sales where the U.S. Government would be responsible for any damages. Consistent with Moderna’s patent pledge the Company is also not seeking damages for activities occurring before March 8 2022.” See also Complaint at Page 38 (Prayer for Relief).

Even with these potential limitations the fact that Moderna is seeking lost profits increases its leverage since a damages case based on lost profits could possibly amount to a significantly higher damages total than a total based solely on reasonable royalties (e.g. if Moderna can show large totals of sales of Spikevax® it should have made but for Pfizer’s sales of Comirnaty®). Accordingly filing this lawsuit and seeking significant damages accomplishes at least two major things for Moderna. First from an exposure management perspective it may serve to mitigate the damages exposure caused by the Alnylam and Arbutus cases. Second it applies even more pressure on Pfizer and BioNTech Moderna’s direct competitors in at least the COVID-19 vaccine space adding to the potential exposure those parties face under three major patent infringement lawsuits and potentially four should Arbutus and Genevant assert infringement claims also. Sometimes a competitor that is sued for patent infringement by another competitor will assert applicable patent infringement counterclaims from its own portfolio to increase exposure to the party that filed the lawsuit but that did not happen here. Neither BioNTech nor Pfizer have asserted any patent infringement counterclaims against Moderna to date.

By asserting their patents lipid pioneers Alnylam Arbutus and Genevant could gain (1) substantial damages awards based on royalties applied to massive vaccine sales should infringement be found; or (2) significant settlement revenues. These parties also run the risk of having their patents invalidated through the subject lawsuits or cancelled through IPR proceedings. This may not be as much of an issue for Alnylam which is asserting patent claims that it applied for and was granted after it was able to learn about the configuration of the Spikevax® and Comirnaty® vaccines (and therefore the subject patents may not be directly applicable to Alnylam’s commercial operation). However with respect to Arbutus and Genevant should one or more of the key Arbutus patents become invalidated in connection with the Moderna or Acuitas cases (or other cases Arbutus and Genevant may file) this would eliminate the ability for those entities to leverage licensing revenues under those patents going forward. Of course in their cases Moderna and CureVac also run the risk of having their asserted patents invalidated and the upside of those cases is the potential to obtain a favorable damages awards or settlements as well.

Expect More Litigation Activity

In 2022 nearly every major mRNA and lipid nanoparticle pioneer clashed in significant patent litigation activity. All of those cases related in some way to the sales of Spikevax® or Comirnaty® and related boosters—the only mRNA-based products generating revenue at this time. Moderna has potential exposure (in the form of reasonable royalty damages) from the lawsuits filed against it by Alnylam and Arbutus and Genevant while Pfizer and BioNTech have potential exposure from lawsuits filed by Alnylam CureVac and Moderna in the form of reasonable royalty damages (in the Moderna case lost profit damages also). These cases will likely persist through 2023 absent any settlements and other suits may be filed in the coming year as innovators assess their patent portfolios and assert patent rights against existing and future mRNA-based products approved for commercialization.

Faced with the possibility of going into the luxury tax next season the New Orleans Pelicans could going into the offseason trying to cut payroll with several trade candidates on their roster.

Michael Scotto said on the latest episode of the HoopsHype podcast that CJ McCollum is ""not untouchable"" in trade talks but he's considered a ""grown-up in the room for a young Pelicans squad providing stability on the court and a good locker room presence for the team.""

The Pelicans currently have $167.4 million in salary on their books for next season. That total doesn't include cap holds that bring their total up to $199.7 million which is nearly $10 million over the projected second tax apron.

Jonas Valančiūnas who has a $23.2 million cap hold is the biggest question mark for the Pelicans among their potential free agents.

ESPN's Bobby Marks noted the Pelicans have never paid the luxury tax in franchise history and the front office's decision regarding Valančiūnas and Naji Marshall who is also a free agent will determine if the club has the full nontaxpayer mid-level exception of $12.9 million or the taxpayer mid-level of $5.1 million available.

Of the potential trade candidates for the Pelicans Brandon Ingram has been the most-talked about thus far. The 26-year-old will be playing on a $36 million expiring contract next season but his deal includes a 15 percent trade kicker that could complicate any potential deal.

ESPN's Brian Windhorst has cited the Philadelphia 76ers as a potential landing spot for Ingram this summer. Scotto noted rival executives consider him to be the ""most likely"" Pelicans player to be moved because the fit on the court ""isn't ideal"" with Zion Williamson.

Next season will mark the first year of McCollum's two-year $64 million deal he signed in September 2022. The contract has descending salaries of $33.3 million in 2024-25 and $30.7 million in 2025-26 that could make it easier to trade.

The Pelicans have invested a lot of money in this core that hasn't produced great results. They have made the playoffs in two of the past three years but lost in the first round both times. They were swept by the Oklahoma City Thunder this year with Williamson unavailable due to a hamstring injury he suffered in the play-in tournament loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMi2AFodHRwczovL25ld3MucGcuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvbmV3cy1kZXRhaWxzLzIwMjQvUHJvY3Rlci0tR2FtYmxlLVJlY2FsbHMtOC4yLU1pbGxpb24tRGVmZWN0aXZlLUJhZ3Mtb2YtVGlkZS1HYWluLUFjZS1hbmQtQXJpZWwtTGF1bmRyeS1EZXRlcmdlbnQtUGFja2V0cy1EaXN0cmlidXRlZC1pbi1VUy1EdWUtdG8tUmlzay1vZi1TZXJpb3VzLUluanVyeS9kZWZhdWx0LmFzcHjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Procter & Gamble Recalls 8.2 Million Defective Bags of Tide Gain Ace and Ariel Laundry Detergent Packets ...,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMi2AFodHRwczovL25ld3MucGcuY29tL25ld3MtcmVsZWFzZXMvbmV3cy1kZXRhaWxzLzIwMjQvUHJvY3Rlci0tR2FtYmxlLVJlY2FsbHMtOC4yLU1pbGxpb24tRGVmZWN0aXZlLUJhZ3Mtb2YtVGlkZS1HYWluLUFjZS1hbmQtQXJpZWwtTGF1bmRyeS1EZXRlcmdlbnQtUGFja2V0cy1EaXN0cmlidXRlZC1pbi1VUy1EdWUtdG8tUmlzay1vZi1TZXJpb3VzLUluanVyeS9kZWZhdWx0LmFzcHjSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E37B3DC0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

By Stefanie Rossel

At first glance the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region holds massive potential for the sale of reduced-risk products (RRPs). Of the 547 million inhabitants 140 million—mostly men—smoke. Smoking prevalence is generally high with Jordan leading the area with a record smoking rate of 65.3 percent among males and it is still increasing. But the promise comes with many hurdles. Of the 22 markets in the region 14 have banned electronic nicotine-delivery systems (ENDS) and of those markets where ENDS are legal several have implemented prohibitively high taxes on these products.

Despite the often adverse business environment in the region Fadi Maayta has ventured into the ENDS market. In 2020 he co-founded Alternative Nicotine Delivery Solutions (ANDS) which he heads as president. Headquartered in Dubai the company sells and distributes vaping products and heated-tobacco products (HTPs) across the Middle East and Africa including in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Saudi Arabia Kuwait Jordan Egypt and Bahrain.

Maayta who at the recent Global Tobacco and Nicotine Forum described MENA as a forgotten region in terms of tobacco harm reduction (THR) says his company’s mission is to provide adult smokers with high-end verified and tested alternative nicotine-delivery solutions promoting a cigarette-free region. He believes there are two main reasons why THR in the MENA region is making only slow process: misinformation and isolated policymaking which stands in stark contrast to the approach taken in the United Kingdom the United States and several European countries. “These countries have made huge steps toward reducing smoking incidences through switching smokers and encouraging nicotine alternative solutions while the Middle Eastern countries are still treating e-cigarettes as combustible cigarettes” says Maayta.

According to him disproportionate taxation of ENDS is a symptom of this wrongheaded approach. In January 2022 Bahrain Saudi Arabia and the UAE implemented 100 percent custom duties on e-cigarettes from 5 percent before 2022 making e-cigarettes far more expensive than the illicit products that evade all taxes Maayta points out.

“In Jordan the government applies 200 percent excise tax on e-cigarettes which makes their prices relatively higher than combustible cigarettes” says Maayta. “The price of a disposable device of 500 puffs is five times higher than the price of a pack of cigarettes. This kind of fiscal treatment will cause two effects: unprecedented numbers of illicit trade in e-cigarettes and a relapse of [former] smokers to smoking combustible cigarettes.” Meanwhile state budgets and legitimate companies are deprived of revenues.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiY2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnB3bWFuaWEuY29tL2xhdGVzdC1uZXdzLW9uLXRoZS1uZXctd3dlLWhxLWxvY2F0aW9uLXVwZGF0ZS1vbi10aGUtZnV0dXJlLW9mLXRpdGFuLXRvd2Vyc9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Latest News on the New WWE HQ Location Update on the Future of Titan Towers,"WWE’s new headquarters are set to open soon.

WWE announced a few months ago that they were relocating their corporate headquarters to 707 Washington Boulevard in Stamford CT from 1241 East Main Street where they had been for decades. The WWE production studios will also relocate from 88 Hamilton Avenue to Washington Boulevard.

In an update a WWE spokesperson told CT Insider that in the first phase of operations at the new location WWE intends to open offices within the 13-story Washington Boulevard tower “towards the end of” the first quarter of 2023.

The remaining office and production space in the new location which will span approximately 400000 square feet is set to open in mid-2023.

WWE intends to relocate all of their Stamford-based employees to the new headquarters this year with more than 800 people working there once all of the space is available. WWE has no plans to keep any employees at its current headquarters on the east side of Stamford or at its current production facility on Hamilton Avenue which is just a few blocks away from the current headquarters on Main Street.

The current WWE headquarters building known as Titan Towers for many years is not for sale but WWE would “entertain discussions with interested parties” according to a WWE spokesman. WWE had previously stated that Titan Towers would be for sale.

The new WWE HQ is the centerpiece of the revitalization of the complex at 677-707 Washington Boulevard which has been vacant for several years due to the relocation of banking giant UBS’s offices across the street in 2016. The new WWE production center will be housed in a seven-story pavilion that used to house one of the world’s largest trading floors when UBS was headquartered there.

We noted a while back how WWE was moving their company headquarters to 707 Washington Boulevard in Stamford CT from 1241 East Main Street where they have been for decades. The WWE production studios are also moving from 88 Hamilton Avenue to the Washington Boulevard location.

In an update a WWE spokesperson told CT Insider that in the first phase of operations at the new location WWE plans to open offices within the 13-story tower on Washington Boulevard “towards the end of” the first quarter of 2023.

The remainder of the office and production space in the new location which will cover around 400000 square feet is scheduled to open in mid-2023.

WWE is planning to move all of their Stamford-based employees to the new HQ this year with more than 800 people working there once all of the space has opened. WWE is not planning to keep any employees at its current HQ on the east side of Stamford or at the current production center on Hamilton Avenue which is just a few blocks away from the current HQ on Main Street.

The current building used for WWE HQ called Titan Towers for years is not for sale but WWE would “entertain discussions with interested parties” according to the WWE spokesman. WWE previously indicated that Titan Towers would be put up for sale.

The new WWE HQ is the centerpiece of the revival of the complex at 677-707 Washington Boulevard which has been empty for a few years due to banking giant UBS relocating its offices across the street in 2016. The new WWE production center will be located in a seven-story pavilion which once hosted one of the world’s largest trading floors when UBS was based there.

The property’s second-largest tenant is tobacco giant Philip Morris International. They opened their new offices this past November relocating from New York City and those cover around 71000 square feet.

The location includes a number of other tenants including architecture firm Perkins Eastman and professional services firm KPMG. With their arrivals in the spring of 2019 and the fall of 2019 KPMG and PE became the first companies to take space at 677 Washington following the departure of UBS.

WWE has been working on the new location for some time now and the WWE logos were added to the building a few months back as seen in the photo above.

Texas’ Marcus Carr and Baylor’s Keyonte George earned the first weekly honors of 2023 as Carr was named Big 12 Men’s Basketball Player of the Week and George was awarded Newcomer of the Week. Each picked up their second honor of the season.



In UT's two victories last week Carr averaged 27.0 points 3.0 assists and 3.0 steals in 32.5 minutes per game. He converted 54.8 percent (17-31) from the floor including 66.7 percent (12-18) from three-point range and 88.9 percent (8-9) from the free throw line while posting six assists against just two turnovers. During the win over Texas A&M-Commerce Carr registered 41 points while hitting 13-of-19 FG including 10-of-15 threes and 5-of-6 FT. He added four assists against one turnover and two steals in 30 minutes. Carr tied the school record for most 3-point FG made in a game equaling the mark of 10 set by Al Coleman vs. K-State on Jan. 12 1997. It marked the first 40-point performance by a Texas player since Reggie Freeman scored 43 in a home win against Fresno State on Dec. 14 1996. Carr tied his collegiate career high in scoring. He also had 41 while playing for Minnesota at Nebraska on Feb. 27 2021. Carr set career highs in FG made and 3-point FG made. He also tied the school record for most points scored in a half (33) in the opening period and set the school record for most points scored in a first half. Carr set the school record for most 3-pointers made in a half with eight in the first 20 minutes. Carr registered 33 points in 18 minutes of action during the first period. The 41 points tied for the eighth-highest single-game scoring total in UT history (record is 49 twice). During Saturday's win at Oklahoma Carr recorded a team-high 13 points dished two assists and tied his career-high with four steals in 36 minutes. His turnaround jumper in the lane with 48 seconds left gave the Longhorns the lead for good and he sealed the victory by hitting a pair of free throws with three seconds remaining.



Playing without one of its leading scorers in LJ Cryer George picked up the slack for Baylor by averaging 18.5 points last week highlighted by 21 against Nicholls in Baylor's first game after Christmas. George was efficient from deep going four-of-six from three-point range and tied a season-high with seven made free throws on a season-best eight trips to the line. It was his fourth 20-point performance of the season. George was one of BU's main scoring threats notching 16 in the conference opener at Iowa State and responded from a tough first half with 15 points on 5-of-10 shooting in the final 20 minutes his highest-scoring half of the season.

HUDSONVILLE — Bill Worst owner of the Pinnacle Center in Hudsonville wants to give students a fighting chance to find their passion in music.

This year Worst is raffling off a pair of tickets to see Taylor Swift — a tour that quickly sold out — to benefit his nonprofit ""Music to Benefit Music."" Each raffle ticket costs $100 and only 200 tickets will be sold.

Worst said he was online for eight hours when Swift’s tickets first went on sale and after trying to checkout he got an error message. He was later contacted by Ticketmaster which made more tickets available for purchase.

“I decided to donate them to the nonprofit because I figured they could do more good by raising more money” he said. “I had to pay a premium dollar to buy them and so I had to make enough for the charity. … We thought $100 was a fair price to take a chance to win the two tickets.”

Raffle tickets can be purchased by calling or visiting the Pinnacle Center or by contacting Worst at 616-481-8183. There's no limit to the number of tickets you can purchase and they’ll be sold on a first come first served basis until all 200 are gone.

The raffle drawing will take place Feb. 25 during the nonprofit's annual benefit dinner at the Pinnacle Center. The winner will get both tickets to Taylor Swift’s concert at Ford Field in Detroit on June 10. The tickets are in the center just eight rows from the stage.

""Music to Benefit Music"" has distributed more than $450000 worth of instruments to 14 public and private schools in West Michigan.

“We’ve donated 35 (ukuleles) plus a storage cart. We’ve donated pianos we’ve donated brass instruments which tend to cost ($3000 or $4000) apiece” Worst said.

Worst doesn’t receive any compensation so every penny raised goes directly towards supporting local music programs. The nonprofit hosts concerts and other fundraisers throughout the year.",,,,,,,,,,,,

A rapidly growing fraud investigation has already identified dozens of victims in multiple counties. Many more are expected.

New Jersey 101.5 first reported the fraud in October after South Brunswick police identified at least five victims. This morning that number is 30 and growing.

PNC customers in at least six New Jersey counties have already been identified.

We are investigating potential fraud affecting certain PNC ATMs. Any customers who notice suspicious activity on their accounts should contact us right away using the number listed on the back of their PNC ATM card. - PNC Bank statement

South Brunswick Police have released a photo of a suspect they believe is responsible for at least one of the illegal withdrawals.

Investigators believe this is is the result of 'skimming.'

A device is placed over an ATM card slot that reads your personal data as you make a transaction. Later the device is removed and the data is loaded onto blank ATM cards that are then used to make illegal withdrawals.

While police have not yet identified the ATM's where the skimmer was used the fact that the victims still have their ATM cards in their possession suggest this is what happened.

In nearly all of the cases the withdrawal amounts have been between $300-400 which would be near the daily limit for a single withdrawal.

PNC issued a statement confirming the fraud and their own investigation. Customers are urged to check their accounts and if they notice suspicious activity to call the number on the back of their ATM card or at www.pnc.com.

If you notice fraudulent activity or you recognize the suspect in the photo contact your local police.

Notching is the practice by credit rating agencies to give different credit ratings to the particular obligations or debts of a single issuing entity or closely related entities.

Rating distinctions among obligations are made based on differences in their security or priority of claim. With varying degrees of losses in the event of default obligations are subject to being notched higher or lower. Thus while company A may have an overall credit rating of ""AA"" its rating on its junior debt may be ""A.""

Key Takeaways Notching is when a credit rating agency bumps up or down the credit rating on an issuer's specific debts or obligations.

This is different than a credit agency upgrading or downgrading the company or issuer as a whole.

Because certain types of debt—for instance subordinated debts—are inherently riskier than senior debts the rating on junior debts can be notched lower.

Similarly those debts from the issuer that are senior and secured by collateral may be notched higher.

Debt notches are evaluated by comparing the individual credit ratings of two or more bonds.

How Notching Works

Companies are given credit scores by specialist credit rating agencies which evaluate a firm's creditworthiness and its ability to meet its debt payments and other obligations. However a company may also issue several types of debts (e.g. secured vs. unsecured) or related types of obligations (such as preferred shares or convertible bonds). As a result the credit rating on those particular debts or obligations may differ somewhat from the issuing company's overall credit rating due to unique risks or restrictions on those obligations.

Moody's Investors Service (""Moody's) and Standard & Poor's Financial Services (""S&P"") are two major credit rating agencies that notch up or notch down instruments within the same corporate family depending on placement in an obligor's capital structure and their level of collateral.

The base from which an instrument is notched in either direction is an obligor's senior unsecured debt (base = 0) or the corporate family rating (CFR). Notching also applies to the structural subordination of debt issued by operating subsidiaries or holding companies according to S&P. As an example the debt of a holding company of an enterprise could be rated lower than the debt of the subsidiaries the entities that directly own the enterprise's assets and cash flows.

Notching is not a precise science and credit rating agencies may use different approaches to determine the credit risk of bond and debt issuers. As a result it is not uncommon for different credit rating agencies to assign different credit ratings to the same issuer.

Moody's Updated Notching Guidance

In 2017 Moody's published an update to its 2007 notching methodology. This most recent guidance indicated as ""applicable in most cases"" was as follows:

Senior secured debt: +1 or +2 notches above the base (0)

Senior unsecured debt: 0

Subordinated debt: -1 or -2

Junior subordinated debt: -1 or -2

Preferred stock: -2

In a small number of cases Moody's will notch beyond the -2 to +2 range under one or more of the following circumstances:

An unbalanced capital structure results in a particular obligation comprising a very small or large proportion of total debt.

A legal regime is less predictable.

There is extra complexity in the legal structure of a corporation.

Tranche Notching Notching is not just used to evaluate the credit risk of bond and debt issuers. It is also used to evaluate the credit risk of other types of financial instruments such as structured finance products such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). CDOs are complex securities that are backed by a pool of assets such as mortgages or corporate bonds. The credit risk of a CDO is determined by evaluating the credit risk of the assets that make up the pool. This process is known as ""tranche notching"" and it involves assigning different credit ratings to different tranches (or slices) of the CDO based on the level of subordination of the tranches. Tranches that are more highly subordinated (i.e. ranked lower in the repayment hierarchy) are considered to be more risky and are assigned lower credit ratings. Tranches that are more senior (i.e. ranked higher in the repayment hierarchy) are considered to be less risky and are assigned higher credit ratings.

Example of Notching

Imagine that ABC Company has issued two corporate bonds: Bond A and Bond B. Bond A is a senior bond which means that it has a higher priority for repayment in the event of default compared to Bond B. Bond B is a junior bond which means that it has a lower priority for repayment.

ABC Company's creditworthiness is evaluated by a credit rating agency which determines that the company has a strong financial profile and is likely to be able to make timely interest and principal payments on both Bond A and Bond B. As a result the credit rating agency assigns ABC Company an A credit rating and assigns both Bond A and Bond B an A credit rating as well.

However over time ABC Company's financial performance begins to deteriorate. It takes on more debt and its profits decline which raises concerns about its ability to meet its financial obligations. As a result the credit rating agency conducts a review of ABC Company's creditworthiness and decides to downgrade the company's overall credit rating from A to BBB.

In this case the credit rating agency would use notching to express the difference in credit risk between Bond A and Bond B. Since Bond A is a senior bond it is considered to be less risky than Bond B and is assigned a BBB+ credit rating. Bond B on the other hand is considered to be more risky and is assigned a BBB- credit rating. The difference in credit risk between Bond A and Bond B is expressed as two notches with Bond A having a higher credit rating (and a lower notch) than Bond B.

What Is a Notch in Bond Rating? In bond trading a notch is a measure of the difference in credit risk between two bonds usually issued by the same issuer. It is calculated by taking the difference in the credit ratings of the two bonds and expressing it in terms of notches. For example if one bond has a credit rating of A- and another bond has a credit rating of BBB+ the difference in credit risk between the two bonds would be expressed as one notch.

Why Is Notching Important? Notching is important because it helps investors to make informed decisions about the creditworthiness of the various bonds and debt instruments issued by the same issuers by using easy to understand ratings grades or scores. By understanding the likelihood of default investors can determine the level of risk they are willing to take on when investing in a particular bond or debt issuer. This is especially important for investors who are considering purchasing high-yield bonds as these bonds are generally considered to be more risky than investment-grade bonds. Notching can also be used by bond and debt issuers to determine their own creditworthiness as it can help them to identify any areas where they may need to improve their financial health in order to attract investors.

What Is a Notch Downgrade? A notch downgrade is a decrease in the credit rating of a particular bond from a debt issuer. It is expressed in terms of notches with each notch representing a difference in credit risk. For example if a bond issuer's credit rating is downgraded from A- to BBB+ the downgrade would be expressed as one notch. A notch downgrade can occur when the creditworthiness of the bond or debt issuer deteriorates. This can be due to a variety of factors including declining financial performance increased debt levels or changes in market conditions that affect the issuer's ability to meet its financial obligations. A notch downgrade can have significant implications for the issuer as it may make it more difficult for the issuer to access funding in the future and may also lead to an increase in the issuer's borrowing costs. It can also have negative consequences for investors in the issuer's bonds as a downgrade may indicate an increased risk of default and may lead to a decrease in the value of the bonds.

What Is Subordination-Based Notching? Subordination-based notching is a method of rating the credit risk of bond or debt issuers based on the level of subordination of the issuer's debts. Subordination refers to the ranking of debts in terms of priority for repayment in the event that the issuer becomes bankrupt or is unable to meet its financial obligations. Debts that are ranked higher in the subordination hierarchy are considered to be more senior and are more likely to be repaid in the event of default. Subordination-based notching is used to determine the credit rating of an issuer by taking into account the level of subordination of the issuer's debts. For example an issuer with highly subordinated debts (i.e. debts that are ranked lower in the subordination hierarchy) may be assigned a lower credit rating than an issuer with more senior debts. This is because the issuer with highly subordinated debts is considered to be at a higher risk of default as it is less likely to have the financial resources available to meet its obligations. Subordination-based notching is often used in the evaluation of structured finance instruments such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).

The Bottom Line

Notching is the process of rating the credit risk of the various bonds from the same debt issuer such as a company or a government using discrete rating levels or notches. So if a company issues several bonds not every one may receive the same credit rating based on its relative riskiness terms features subordination and clauses. It is used to determine the likelihood that the issuer will default on its debt obligations. Notching can be used to determine the credit rating of an issuer which is a measure of the issuer's ability to make timely interest and principal payments. Notching can also be used to determine the risk premium that investors should demand for taking on the risk of investing in the bond or debt issuer.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiX2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9idXNpbmVzcy8yMDIzLzAxLzAyL3N0YXJ3b29kLXJlbnRzLWFwYXJ0bWVudHMtcHJpdmF0ZS1pbnZlc3RvcnMv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Rising rents were a crisis for tenants.

Project Fast-Forward F-Body will cover all the bases when it comes to upgrading an early third-generation Camaro to current standards including appearance. While the '82 Z/28 was bold and trendy when it initially hit the streets it is dated compared to the later third-generation cars. The body changes Chevrolet made over the 11-year production run were limited to front and rear fascias and side moldings but the later smoother pieces made a tremendous difference in the car's image. Since the changes included only those trim pieces updating an '82-'84 Z/28 or any year third-generation base-model Camaro to '85-'9O or '91-'92 specs is pretty straightforward.

Mike Paradis and Leon Miller at Cars Trucks & Concepts handled the conversion for us while fixing minor body flaws and spraying the car with the popular Bright Aqua Poly color (or teal in layman's terms). Even the color choice helps bring this car forward in appearance since it wasn't available on earlier F-bodies. The body pieces required for the update include a front fascia front turn-signal lamps a lower front molding a grille a front reinforcement a rear fascia lower side moldings door moldings and a flat hood. The front fascia front reinforcement and hood are available new from Sherman & Associates while the remainder of the parts must be purchased from General Motors or a salvage yard.

In addition to the updates achieved by using factory pieces Cars Trucks & Concepts furthered the smooth-and-cool treatment of the car by filling in the front emblem mount removing the antenna hole and swapping the Camaro door handles for flush-mount '88-'94 GM truck door handles. It's all enhanced by the quality of the paint job. The firewall fenderwells and core support were stripped and painted body color (painting them anything but body color on a late-model GM car is butch) and the car was completely disassembled so that every nook and cranny could be cleaned and painted. The whole process took some time but the finished product was worth the wait.

Next month we'll wave the magic update-wand over the interior and suspension to make the car comfortable and fun to drive especially when the road in front of you isn't straight.

SMOOTH MOVES

The point of updating the '82 Camarc with '91-'92 body pieces is to smooth the appearance of the car. (It is also an affordable way to own a newer-looking car). Three other things Cars Trucks & Concepts did to complete the smooth look was to fill the antenna hole fill the front emblem mount and replace the door handles with flush-mount '88-'94 GM truck handles. These subtle changes make a big difference in the appearance of the car. Remember: It's often the items youdon'tnotice that make the car look better.

It took less than an hour to make the antenna hole completely disappear. First the area was scuffed using 40-grit sandpaper. Next a circular patch was cut from similargauge steel. The edges were filed until the patch was barely larger than the hole. The patch was then placed against the fender from the backside and welded in place. The circumference was welded in short bursts to keep heat down minimizing warpage of the thin late-model sheetmetal The welds were ground flat and body filler was used to completely smooth over the hole. Paradi recommends spraying the backside with rubberized undercoating to protect it from rust.

The easiest modification was to fill in the indention in the front fascia where a Camaro emblem is supposed to reside. Since the nose is a flexible body part Paradis used Duramix 4030 Flexible Bumper Repair. It comes in a dual-reservoir syringe and applies like an epoxy. Paradis beveled the emblem mounting holes with a die grinder and sanded the sharp recessed edges for good adhesion. Once dry the repair material can be sanded smooth.

The door-handle trick is more difficult to execute. A portion of the truck door that mounts the door handle should be cut out. It is positioned so that the rear mounting screw for the door handle will come through the doorjamb as it does on the truck. The truck-door portion is traced on the Camaro door and the section is cut out using a cutoff wheel. A piece of cardboard is slipped between the window and the outer door skin to protect the glass during the procedure.

Paradis stepped the perimeter with a panel flanger so that the patch piece from the truck door would sit flush or a little below the level of the door skin. The upper forward corner of the opening had bracing attached to the door skin that wouldn't allow the use of the flanger. In that area a pick hammer and flat dolly were used to produce the step.

Once the fit was perfect and the door handle was parallel to the bottom of the door the panel was welded in place. Paradis used a panel spotter to weld the piece in to minimize distortion. A wire welder was used along the door edges. Body filler was used to finish the smooth installation. The rods actuating the door and lock I mechanism can be welded to the rods on the new door handle I from the interior side of the doors.

Late-model GM owners can now relate to early Chrysler enthusiasts when it comes to paint. For a complete and quality job the car must be entirely disassembled becauseeverythingis painted body color. That includes the inner fenderwells the firewall the core support—everything.

The rear fascia lower moldings spoiler gas door and taillights were removed. Mike Paradis at Cars Truck & Concepts explains that removing those parts permits complete preparation around corners and crevices that would be inaccessible otherwise. Those spots are where the paint would start lifting later. Removing the parts also allows the painter to spray the backsides and hidden edges (a process referred to as jambing) while the parts are off the car. It all adds up to a first-rate paint job that will look great and be durable.

Part of our paint and bodywork includes a body update. We combined new replacement body parts with previously road-tested '91'92 body pieces to visually turn our '82 Z/28 into a '91-'92 RS. The front fascia and rebar (reinforcement) are available new from Sherman & Associates. The company does not offer the lower front molding grille or lights which must be purchased from General Motors or a salvage yard. Rips in the fascias can be repaired and dents or waviness require a heat gun and a skilled hand so be choosy if you're purchasing the front and rear fascias used. Marv's USA Auto Dismantling often has complete front fascias in stock which gives you everything you need to update the nose of the car.

Since we were leaving the engine crossmember and front suspension bolted in place we masked from the framerails down and will later paint the area semigloss black. The underhood surfaces were scuffed using Scotchbrite® pads (available at paint-supply stores) and bare metal spots were covered with PPG DP40 Epoxy Primer. This primer should be used on any exposed metal aluminum or fiberglass (use DP x 844 for flexible body parts) and can be sprayed over the old finish or undercoats once they've been sanded and cleaned.

If your car is a Z/28 IROC or '85-'9O RS almost all of the holes and brackets should be in place for the '91-'92 body pieces. Pre-'85 Camaros need slots cut in the front fenders to attach the lower front molding. On base-model bodies you'll need two sidemolding supports (General Motors part No. 10191801) that should be spot-welded below the door openings. The rest of the body pieces require that holes be drilled in the body to correspond to attaching clips and screws. Our complete set of '91'92 RS lower side moldings came from Marv's USA and are the same as '91-'92 Z/28 moldings.

Once the individual body pieces were jambed and the engine bay was painted body color the car was reassembled. The PPG K200 primer was wet sanded with 400-grit sandpaper and then sealed with DAS 1980 PrimerSealer. Once the sealer was dry Paradis sprayed the DBU basecoat.

As it turned out our initial purchase was a wise one as the car didn't need any major body repairs. While the body was disassembled the door dings and other minor body flaws were repaired using Thompson Lacquer Company Ultra Light body filler. Cars Trucks & Concepts then block sanded the body parts and sprayed all the jamb areas. Complete disassembly such as this is the only way to complete a color change correctly. Paradis sprayed '94 GM Bright Aqua Poly (PPG WA9796) using PPG Deltron Basecoat Urethane (DBU) and Delglo Acrylic Urethane (DAU) clear.

Shares Verizon of have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+12.8% vs. +11.7%). The company has reported modest first-quarter results with the bottom line beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same. The deployment of a cloud-native container-based virtualized architecture has led to increased flexibility scalability and cost efficiency across its network.



Verizon is offering various mix and match pricing in both wireless and home broadband plans which has led to solid client additions. Focus on emerging growth services like cloud security and professional services will likely reap long-term benefits.



However lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns. Huge promotional expenses and lucrative discounts to expand customer base are weighing on margins. High capital expenditure for continuous network upgrade and fiber deployment is a headwind. A muted guidance for 2024 is worrisome.



(You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>)



Intuitive Surgical’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry over the past year (+25.7% vs. +4.0%). The company ended the first quarter on a positive note beating estimates on both counts. Revenues improved year over year.

The rallies are set to be held two weeks after the U.S. House select committee on the January 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol released its final report on an 18-month investigation into the insurrection and former President Donald Trump's role in planning and orchestrating the attempt to stop lawmakers from certifying the 2020 presidential election.

The report showed that Trump was the driving force behind the insurrection and the committee recommended that the former Republican president—who announced his 2024 presidential candidacy in November—be barred from ever holding public office again.

Progressive Democrats of America (PDA) said Monday that Americans must speak out about ongoing threats posed by the Republican Party and Trump supporters regardless of whether Trump runs for office again.

Republicans ""are working to sabotage future elections by changing state laws threatening election officials and packing election administration offices so that they can have the final say over election results—even when they lose"" said PDA. ""We cannot be complacent; we are calling for an end to the ongoing violent and criminal attacks on our freedoms. We must stand up for our elections by protecting voters election officials and a free and fair process for all Americans.""



At the rallies planned for Friday organizers plan to express support for the ongoing investigations into the former president including the U.S. Justice Department's probe into his retention of classified documents after he left office and a criminal investigation into election interference by Trump's allies in Georgia.



They will also ""call upon local state and federal legislators to defend our freedom to vote by passing legislation to take down barriers to voting and protect election officials and voters.""



More than 170 Republicans who deny President Joe Biden won the 2020 election are returning to or taking public office on Tuesday and at least seven states passed at least 10 laws last year making it more difficult to vote.



As the federal government continues to investigate Trump's role in the January 6 insurrection said PDA ""it's our time to stand strong for justice and democracy.""

He and his protege Aristotle predicted that rule by the people would devolve to little more than mob rule. Aristotle wrote that “to be ruled by men whose appetites will be something feral and whose passions — no matter how upstanding they may be — are bound to warp them is to be ruled by wild beasts.”

Both therefore recommended rule by an educated elite with a “philosopher king” at the top of the hierarchy. This elite would collectively be referred to as an “aristocracy” and would ensure prosperity for the masses with their beneficent but strict rule.

This tendency to distrust the people and prefer rule by an all-knowing all-powerful elite is not unique to ancient Greeks. We’ve seen it numerous times in the last century especially in the totalitarian regimes of communist and fascist dictators.

But I would also argue we’re seeing the gradual emergence of a ruling elite in the U.S. who believe that they and only they should be arbiters of our political reality.

We saw it with Covid where public health authorities led by Dr. Fauci claimed with unflinching certitude to know how to deal with the outbreak. We now know they were mostly guessing for the first six months at least. And that they refused to consider data that contradicted their views in their subsequent decision-making.

Democratic politicians especially seemed to relish their new plenary powers to shut down schools businesses and churches while permitting and even encouraging protests and riots against systemic racism.

This same elite expends a great amount of time and energy telling Americans how racist sexist homophobic xenophobic and transphobic they are and orchestrating governmental and corporate re-education programs to expunge the populace of their various hatreds.

The elite is so convinced of their righteousness that they are willing to not only teach children about homosexuality and transgenderism but to poison and mutilate kids under 18 to achieve their desired gender expression.

When people attempt to push back against this gender insanity by simply revealing what schools and hospitals are doing in this regard they are shouted down as bigots and threatened with violence and legal prosecution. The FBI went so far as to accuse some parents of being equivalent to domestic terrorists as we all know.

This progressive elite acts like their progenitors in fascist Germany and communist Russia by demonizing their opponents. In this last election it wasn’t just a bad thing if Republicans got elected; it was labeled the “end of democracy.”

In their minds any means are justified to fight their opponents and ensure their power. That is why you heard voices from the Left talking about getting rid of the Electoral College and the Supreme Court when those institutions are deemed a threat to the elite agenda after decades of being the servant of that agenda.

That’s why elites in our government do not hesitate to use social media to suppress information about Biden or Covid that went against their preferred narrative. For them the constitution is not a guarantor of our basic rights but an impediment to their rule that should be dismissed as a hateful relic of our white supremacist founding fathers.

This is also why somebody like Biden can get away with blatant corruption while the elites falsify charges against Trump to remove him from office.

Remember that Biden bragged about withholding $1 billion in aid from Ukraine unless they fired the Attorney General who was investigating the company that was paying his son to be a consultant. For the elites this is no problem but Trump making a call to the Ukrainian president to inquire about that case is deemed to be an impeachable offense.

Some of you may think that my argument is blown up by the fact that the elites also are very strong advocates of much looser voting laws which allow in theory more people to vote. Yes the elites want more people voting especially those who aren’t educated about our political process or the issues at hand. They use government transfer payments and fear-mongering to encourage people to vote for them although in reality the terrible results of their policies (higher inflation and rampant crime in low income neighborhoods) show that their concern for the poor is superficial at best.

And look at how they behave when it comes to climate issues. They insist that we not only believe that climate change is a man-made phenomenon but that we have to drastically alter our way of life in order to survive when much more rational and economically feasible measures are available to adapt to increasing temperatures.

Never mind that the American populace has not voted directly for the kind of top-down controls that climate activists are pushing through our government. Our ruling elite in true platonic fashion believes they know better than us and can simply disregard our beliefs when it suits them.

My final example is abortion. The Supreme Court which used to be a reliable tool of the ruling elite or the progressive aristocracy overruled Roe v. Wade not because the justices were pro-life but because it was bad law and injurious to our overall judicial and legal framework. It’s never a good idea to manipulate law to fit your agenda even if your agenda is left-wing and progressive.

The Left went crazy when the Supreme Court overruled Roe and not just because it eliminated their preferred top-down system of governance but because it returned that question to the people whose beliefs they despise.

This is the regime that is in power now trying to quell all dissent and make permanent their domination in our country. The current policy at the border to let hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants into the country is not a mistake. It’s a gambit to secure more votes for the future and create the kind of chaos that causes people to put more of their trust in government at a time when our trust should be at its lowest level ever.

This current condition also explains why there is so little real criticism of the massive failures and lies of the Biden administration whereas there was a cottage industry devoted to highlighting Tump’s real or supposed failings.

The elites will not and do not critique their own no matter how egregious the violation because they are playing to win at any cost. Which means that the fourth estate which is supposed to keep our politicians in check totally fails to do such a thing when it comes to left side of the aisle. This gives them encouragement to run rough shod over constitutional and legal principles in pursuit of evermore centralized government control and top-down rule over our citizenry.

The good news is that in our country at least we have enough independent thinkers to stand up to this new progressive aristocracy and thwart their plans. Just by speaking the truth and refusing to blindly accept various mainstream narratives we will succeed in preventing the complete takeover of our country by our elite overlords. I look forward to seeing how this all plays out in 2023.

The Cincinnati-based supermarket chain is now selling what it calls America's first carbon-neutral eggs.

By now you're probably familiar with cage-free eggs free-range eggs and pasture-raised eggs. These new carbon-neutral eggs are a step beyond even those varieties in terms of animal welfare sustainability and progressive food policies in general.

The egg-laying hens in this case conduct their business within a unique closed-loop production system developed in the Netherlands. Pioneering Dutch company Kipster Farms is partnering with Kroger and its U.S. supplier MPS Eggs Farms on the new carbon-neutral program.

The birds are raised in modern solar panel-equipped henhouses which are not only free of cages but also include skylights and multiple garden areas where ""the birds have trees rocks climbing structures and other things to play on"" as MPS Egg Farms Vice President Sam Krouse recently explained to Farm Flavor.

MPS built four of these newly styled henhouses in Indiana after touring similar facilities in Europe.

To reduce their carbon footprint the hens eat repurposed bakery by-products instead of traditional corn-based feed and their manure is turned into organic fertilizer according to Krouse.

While this surely improves the quality of life for the chickens it's not immediately clear how it impacts the quality of the eggs. For now the Simple Truth-brand carbon-neutral eggs are only available at select Kroger locations in Ohio and Michigan. The company plans to bring them to more stores in the coming year.

For added transparency the packaging even includes a QR code linking customers to a live webcam inside the new egg-production facilities. Check it out here.

It's not quite the intimately detailed dossier on Colin the locally raised organic chicken from TV's Portlandia—but it's close."

Photo from Ferrell Build-Design Facebook page. The current Amazon facility was built by the same companies involved with the construction of a new 1-million-square-foot facility north of the airport. Photo by John Chadwell. Farrell-Design Company installed 8.922 concrete columns down 51.1 feet to stabilize the land where the 1-million-square fulfillment center is being built near Hollister Municipal Airport. Photo from Ferrell Build-Design Facebook page.

Ever since the Hollister Planning Commission approved a 1.05-million-square-foot fulfillment center Jan. 13 2022 the overriding question has been what company will ultimately take up residence there. Project Almond currently under construction is on 73 acres in the planned Clearist Industrial Park north of the Hollister Municipal Park on San Felipe Road in Hollister.

The Project Almond fulfillment and distribution facility is 18 times larger than a professional football field and eight times larger than the nearby Amazon delivery hub which opened in September 2021. The new project will include 20000 square feet of office space. Over the last few months a company that specializes in foundation solutions is putting in an astonishing 8922 in-ground columns each over 50 feet deep.

After multiple requests from BenitoLink neither the Planning Commission former Mayor Ignacio Velazquez or City Manager Brett Miller would tell BenitoLink who the future occupant is. None of the companies involved would reveal the name of a future tenant.

Despite the size and impact of both the recently operational Amazon building in north Hollister and the new center currently under construction the privacy afforded the companies by Hollister leadership and the planning commission has meant the public is in the dark when it comes to this new employer.

Originally in March 2021 Duke Realty Development Services an international real estate developer based in Indianapolis Indiana submitted the project to the Planning Commission. Duke was also involved with the Amazon Hub project that was finally revealed on Sept. 4. Amazon opened three weeks later on Sept. 28 and at the time was planning on filling 300 job positions. The $50-million Amazon Hub facility is located at 1551 Citation Way.

Duke rebuffed repeated requests from BenitoLink for information about who the tenant will be for the county’s next fulfillment center.

Abraham Prado who worked in Hollister’s planning department and has since moved to a similar position with the county told commissioners Jan. 13 2022 that products such as furniture and appliances will be unloaded at the site. He said the products will then be sorted stored picked assembled and loaded onto line haul trucks headed to other distribution facilities or consumers.

Prado said 200 tractor-trailers (100 incoming and 100 outgoing) are expected to make daily deliveries in a 24-hour period with half doing so between midnight and 8 a.m. Additionally as many as 80 box trucks and vans are expected to be used by the distribution center leaving at 5 a.m. and returning at 2 p.m.

In June 2022 Inman a real estate agent news organization announced “Warehouse giant Amazon landlord Prologis buys Duke Realty for $26B.” By Oct. 3 Prologis had fully acquired Duke Realty and all of its assets including the Hollister Project Almond project a spokesperson confirmed.

Since 2000 Prologis has been closely connected to Amazon according to its website building strategic distribution space in 19 markets including the United Kingdom China Japan and the United States. In Feb. 2022 the company opened a 1-million square-foot fulfillment center in Tracy Calif. This was the second Amazon facility built in the same industrial park.

The Prologis spokesperson told BenitoLink that she could not “speculate” on who their client is that will occupy the Hollister facility. When pressed she would only say “I cannot speculate or confirm we are coming to Hollister.” She would not however after repeated prompts deny Amazon was the future tenant.

In Hollister three more companies with long-standing relationships with Amazon were involved in both the completed hub fulfillment center and the Almond project under construction north of the airport.

Alston Construction built the current hub and their sign is now on the fence leading to the new project. Project Almond is also listed on the company website. Alston did not respond to BenitoLink’s request for comment.

An employee with Don Chapin Company which has been delivering concrete to the Almond construction site said he was not authorized to reveal the tenant.

Over the last month there has been activity at the site being conducted by Placerville California-based Farrell Design-Build Companies Inc. The company website states that it specializes in “ground improvement” and “deep foundation pile solutions”. The company site shows that they drive concrete columns into the ground to improve stability below buildings.

Farrell Design-Build is installing 8922 concrete columns to depths of 51.5 feet at the Hollister site according to its Facebook page. Hollister Planning Commission member David Huboi told BenitoLink that potential soil liquefaction is the most logical explanation for the work being done. He explained that land north of the Hollister Airport is either already unstable or it may be susceptible to liquefaction meaning the ground can liquify should there be an earthquake of as little as 4.5 magnitude.

The company did not respond to BenitoLink’s request for comments. BenitoLink also reached out to other possible tenants based on the business description of the company that is expected to eventually inhabit the building including IKEA and American Freight. An IKEA spokesperson said it is not involved. American Freight did not respond.

Credit: cmophoto.net on Unsplash.

German financial services group Deutsche Bank has been asked by the European Central Bank (ECB) to maintain higher capital.

The development comes as the Eurozone banking regulator pushes banks to reduce the risks they face in the leveraged finance business.

The new prudential capital requirements took effect on 1 January 2023.

“The increase is driven by the ECB’s newly introduced separate assessment of risks stemming from leveraged finance activities” the lender said in a statement.

Specifically the German bank will be required on a consolidated basis to maintain a Common Equity Tier 1 (CET 1) capital ratio of at least 10.55% compared to 10.43% as of 30 September 2022.

In November this year Bloomberg reported that Deutsche Bank and its French peer BNP Paribas were among the bank facing increased capital requirements related to leveraged loans.

The ECB is concerned that some banks do not fully understand the risks involved in leveraged loans business.

As per the report Deutsche Bank CEO Christian Sewing has said that the bank does not need warnings from the ECB to contain the risks.

Deutsche Bank’s CET 1 capital ratio was 13.33% as of 30 September 2022.

In November 2022 BaFin ordered Deutsche Bank to address issues regarding money laundering and terrorist financing.

The Sunday Gleaner had a heart-to-heart with the entrepreneur while on her honeymoon in Montego Bay Jamaica.

She grew up in the first black community in the US Kingman Park in Capitol Hill Washington DC as a chubby and highly intelligent child with bright aspirations of becoming an entrepreneur.

“I was always considered smart nice and giving. I was a chubby kid that loved puzzles botany and entrepreneurship. I dreamed of one day being successful enough to go on an extended vacation to Jamaica. I never imagined it would be my honeymoon or that I would do it in a bikini” she told us.

Angel Rich-Jones is no stranger to the finance world. In fact she started her first company when she was 11 years old. “That year I participated in the invention convention. And crazy enough my idea was to integrate technology into students’ desks so they could interact with the desk as a computer screen and print their work from the desk. I never thought I would actually own a tech company. My love for technology intensified after becoming a data scientist” she explained.

In 2013 she and her business partner started The Wealth Factory a business that has trekked an interesting journey of peaks and valleys “After I learned that people were so addicted to mobile games that they were walking head first into traffic I said ‘My God imagine if they learned something’. That’s when I decided to reverse-engineer the Fair Isaac credit reporting system and apply game mechanics to it.”

The company is launching its own Visa Signature debit and credit card to offer account holders unique equitable banking and interest rates” she explained further.

So what inspired her to take this empowering route of freeing others from financial burdens and constraints? Her own journey.

She loved learning new things and was able to improve on her writing and speaking skills from high school. By the time she was in college she began to focus on perfecting those skills as a straight A scholar holding leadership positions in clubs. She even wrote and directed a film won case competitions and created profitable businesses. But she recalled a time swimming in a sea of college debt beyond graduation.

Being teased about her weight as a child was also something that Rich-Jones had to grapple with. So when she moved to Beijing for work she set out on a health and fitness goal losing 100 pounds during her three-month internship with the Republic of China. “I became the first black person and woman to within their foreign security help to assist with the 2007 Olympics. That’s where I discovered healthier eating patterns” she added.

Rich-Jones went on to get her financial start as a global market research analyst for Prudential Financial. With her eyes on the prize she dreamed of one day partnering with major financial institutions telecommunications companies and governments with the goal of improving credit scores in cost -effective ways.

She plans to further diversify the way in which people could go about paying fines exchanging funds and making donations with innovative solutions through the app. “The app is set to launch during Black History Month of 2023 in partnership with VISA and Experian to name a few” she added.

Noting that the biggest stressor on Earth is money the entrepreneur explained that it is important to be able to be lingual and functional in financial literacy. If she can help by providing the necessary tools then that is a difference she is proud to make in this world.

Already on this path of greatness she has been named by Forbes Magazine as the next Steve Jobs. This is a title that she dubs both accurate and honourable. “I think we are taught a false lesson to keep your head down and climb the ladder. Instead you should develop the skills and intelligence to be confident enough to aim straight for the top because the bottom is overcrowded. You must have guts and grit” she asserted.

And if Forbes wasn’t enough her husband Karl illuminated more on the light that is his wife. “I realised unicorns are real. A person shouldn’t have this much creativity compassion and pride but somehow you have that in addition to being fun intelligent God-fearing and refined” he shared in his vows.

The married couple who are familiar with the island enjoyed a beautiful honeymoon at Half Moon Resort in Rose Hall St James. The dynamic duo described the hotel as the diamond of the Caribbean. “ We loved every second of our honeymoon and will forever have a special place in our hearts for Jamaica.”

""On the auto ancillary side I like Apollo Tyres because of reduced capex and possibility of margin improvements. Bharat Forge because of its ex auto forays should drive earnings strongly especially on the defence part over the next few years"" says asksandipsabharwal.comYes exactly and that gives an opportunity now because I have never invested in insurance companies as I found the valuations to be very high and there was a story of secular growth and as such insurance companies doing well. I think we are now coming to that stage where valuations are more reasonable.So both HDFC Life in terms of higher quality franchise and ICICI Prudential Life after the selloff in terms of something which could surprise as the market conditions improve offer value at this stage. Insurance was much fancied for many years but did not give returns. People have lost faith and now there is some opportunity. Given the kind of returns that will come in 2023 insurance companies should be able to outperform this year for sure.Yes there are midcap and largecap IT companies. Midcap IT companies got more fancied and had a deeper selloff but they could have more impact on their performance as they are more dependent on a few clients where slowdown could have an impact. Larger companies might have a lesser impact but the management commentary ex of HCL Tech has not turned negative.They are still relatively more bullish than what the data indicates in terms of growth that will be there. I think that it will be very interesting to watch. The results and commentaries come out starting next week and I would still wait out the IT sector overall.On the largecap side L&T should continue to outperform because it is still very under-owned relative to growth prospects. I like M&M because fundamentally they are doing much better than what everyone expected and will continue to do much better and valuations are not so high.On the midcap side it could be a wide variety of stocks across sectors on the capex theme. I like something like VA Tech Wabag which is a company reinventing itself in terms of generating cash flows trades at single digit valuations for next year and it had a peak at some stage of 750-800 still at 320-330 I would think that it should do well.Sugar is a space which we got into. The stocks have moved up but it is a good story for the next couple of years. Balrampur Chini has a better quality of management and their buybacks have reduced equity by nearly 20-25% over the last few years which is good for returns for existing shareholders going forward.On the auto ancillary side I like Apollo Tyres because of reduced capex and possibility of margin improvements. Bharat Forge because of its ex auto forays should drive earnings strongly especially on the defence part over the next few years.

Aditya Puri was at the helm for 25 years; Uday Kotak since 2003. Both have created a certain culture and ethos which HDFC Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank stand for. Axis Bank has changed its name and periodically its culture.

In the initial years when it was called UTI Bank it had SBI’s culture. Many of its executives including the boss and the second-in-command came from an SBI subsidiary State Bank of Bikaner & Jaipur. (It was merged with SBI in March 2017.)

PJ Nayak a bureaucrat transformed the bank soaked in public sector culture into a private bank. Even though he was a bureaucrat he was not exactly fond of business enterprises owned by the government and had strong views on many things. From Unit Trust of India where he was executive trustee Nayak joined the bank as a director in December 1999 and took over as CMD on January 1 2000. Little over a fortnight later on January 18 he held his first meeting with the bank’s senior executives in the boardroom at its headquarters at Maker Tower F Cuffe Parade Mumbai.

By end-December the bank had a deposit base of Rs 3700 crore; the target for the financial year ending on March 31 was Rs 4200 crore. Nayak just 18 days in banking persuaded the team to raise it to Rs 4700 crore. By March-end the deposit pile rose to Rs 5200 crore—a growth of almost 50 per cent in just a quarter!

That’s the beginning of the race which continued till April 2009 when Nayak left office just a couple of months shy of completing his second two-year term.

Blank vertical book template.

How did he do it? Within months of taking the helm he raised the staff ’s salary by 30 per cent (they were the least paid in the private sector) and ensured they got stock options. He never accepted too many options—certainly much less than bank bosses typically get. At one stroke he created pride in his employees and a sense of ownership.

His bureaucratic trait was visible in his belief in hierarchy. A stickler for time he would do extensive homework for whomever he met or someone with whom he travelled in the same car. And he had interests beyond banking. When he travelled to Kochi the local operations head had to brush up on all socioeconomic statistics to engage him in a meaningful conversation.

Often the managing director of a company would get to know something from Nayak about his own company that he was unaware of!

He was a leader with a vision for the bank an eye for detail an elephantine memory and the power of execution but his Achilles heel was a poor understanding of his colleagues’ capability.

In business the most critical choices one makes relate to people. As a boss he was a good judge of good people and a bad judge of bad people.

Remember the phrase “Trust but verify” which Suzanne Massie an American scholar taught to President Ronald Reagan. She was the US president’s adviser on Russian affairs. She prepared Reagan for the nuclear disarmament discussions with the Soviet Union with this.

Nayak trusted his lieutenants blindly never verified. Many took advantage of that. Some say he was aware of his colleagues’ shortcomings but he continued to back them as they were delivering. He had the big picture in front of him.

When the parent UTI wanted to split the post of the CMD to clip his wings he threatened to quit. UTI promptly changed its mind (probably at the intervention of the finance ministry).

In another instance he actually stormed out of his office and quit. That was a fallout of the merger talks of Global Trust Bank with UTI Bank which eventually did not happen.

It was disgraced UTI Chairman PS Subramanyam’s initiative. The process started in December 2000 and was called off in April 2001.

When a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) which probed the stock scam of 2001 made a mention in its report that Nayak as UTI Bank boss “stood to gain personally from the merger” and asked for a probe on managerial failure in not getting due diligence conducted anomalies in the decision-making process and lessons learnt regarding any future merger talks Nayak packed up and left his office.

He returned a week later only after a two-member committee appointed by the bank board exonerated him.

Nayak had lost the board’s confidence on succession by the end of his tenure at 62 (he could have continued but settled for a two-year term his second extension till July 2009). Nayak had groomed an insider for the top job but the board did not find the person suitable. That’s how Shikha Sharma then head of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company walked in.

In protest Nayak cut short his term by a couple of months. Two years before that UTI Bank was renamed and rebranded as Axis Bank in July 2007.

The last time a bank changed its name—not following a merger or acquisition—was in 1955 when Imperial Bank was renamed State Bank of India. The campaign for the name change “UTI Bank is now Axis Bank” was based on the premise of identical twins.

“Finding twins is tough” Sumanto Chattopadhyay group creative director O&M who created it had said. “But some of the twins like the two little girls in the commercial were so charming that it was completely worth the effort. By the end of the shoot we ourselves were getting confused about who’s who.”

Nayak didn’t fire a single employee of the then massively underperforming workforce. Instead he had reconstructed the bank almost entirely with the help of people from within. He had picked up only two senior executives from UTI—one a legal expert and the other for corporate loans.

Sharma too reconstructed the bank and made a big bet on the corporate loan book but to do this she brought in people from outside.

Internal Job Portal

Insiders joke that after Sharma took over they began to refer to the bank’s IJP or internal jobs portal as I(CICI Bank) JP(Morgan)! For every important position she brought in people from outside (mostly with ICICI Bank connections) and made the insiders insecure and lose their sense of ownership of the bank.

She introduced the bell curve for performance appraisal weeding out many employees including the senior officers. Despite all these the Axis Bank employees remember her for the lovely handloom saree they got as a Diwali gift every year. Opinion within the bank differs on her HR strategy. Many say Nayak’s tolerance level for non-performance was high; as a result the private bank developed a culture of a public sector undertaking where job security was taken for granted. Others feel Sharma’s aggression on the HR front changed the bank’s culture—from collaboration to competition.

In contrast to Nayak her time management was awful. If a meeting was slated for 10 am people would be happy if the boss walked in by 10.30. Even that’s an understatement one bank executive says.

She was extremely sharp and put the fear of God in the employees. She would read the relevant papers only before a meeting and skim through a dozen files quickly but ask the most difficult questions at the meetings for which others were often unprepared despite extensive homework.

Even though Sharma never dropped Chanda Kochhar’s name in any meeting or even private conversation the rivalry between Sharma and ICICI Bank’s Kochhar is something many bankers love to talk about. Sharma’s aspiration was probably to make Axis Bank a bigger and better ICICI Bank. She mainly focused on retail assets and left the wholesale book to the corporate banking head.

Paying too much for acquiring an investment banking business and chasing corporate loans as if there’s no tomorrow are manifestations of such aspirations.

As bad loans piled up the RBI did not allow Sharma a longer tenure.

After taking over the mantle from Nayak in June 2009 at the first offsite of senior bankers in Udaipur wearing a long skirt Sharma led the team on a “fire walk” as a confidence- inducing team-building gig thought up by one of the big consultancies.

She knew the art of walking on hot coal—pacing is the secret. If you’re too slow the coals have a chance to burn your feet. If you’re too fast your feet will sink deeper into the layer of ash also increasing your chances of being burned. She was a master of firewalking—walking swiftly without rushing.

Unfortunately she could not keep the balance till the end. Too slow in plugging the loopholes in strategy and too fast in changing the culture Sharma found herself in the doghouse. It was a journey from super confidence to extreme vulnerability.

How did that happen? That’s a separate story.

Highlights Telegram's pie chart visual with tabs shows whats taking up space

Telegram's blur tool can cover up sensitive data while sharing photos

Custom animated emoji does not require a premium subscription

Telegram has added several new features as a part of its latest update which is rolling out for both iOS and Android devices. New chat and privacy features aside the new update also adds better controls for group admins and brings more features to smaller groups. Group admins can now choose to hide members in a particular group to protect their members from unwanted personal messages. Topics which were earlier available only for larger groups(with over 200 members) is now available for all groups. Users can also show their profile image to specific users while setting a ""public profile picture"" for everyone else.

According to details shared by the messaging service users will now be able to hide media in chats by using spoiler formatting. While the feature was previously available for text messages it's now available to cover both photos and videos. The feature adds a shimmering layer which blurs the image until the recipient taps it to view the hidden content.

The new update lets users add separate auto-remove settings for messages in private chats groups or channels. The chat app has always allowed re-downloading of content from its cloud servers to save space on a device and also let users set a maximum cache size as well. The update adds a new pie chart visual along with special tabs for media files and music which gives users a clearer idea about what can be deleted to save storage space. iOS users will also notice faster load times for previewing cache size. Progress animations on Android whether users are uploading a photo or opening a link now appear smoother.

Telegram will now let users set a profile picture of their choice for their individual contacts. The set pictures will only be visible to the user and no one else. At the same time users can even share or suggest a good profile picture to their contact and the feature makes it easier for the recipient to set it as their profile picture if they wish to do so. The update also lets users set public profile photos. This picture could be something generic and different from the one that's visible to known contacts. Telegram has even added the ability to set visibility to ‘Nobody' and then add some users or groups as exceptions.

The new update also brings drawing and text tools for users. The new drawing tool will automatically change the width of the stroke depending on drawing speed and will also smoothen lines as well. A new blur tool that can blur out sensitive text and even people while sharing images has also made its way to the app. There's also a new eye-dropper tool to pick colours. Custom animated emoji for text on images are now available for both premium and regular users. The update adds 10 new custom animated emoji for premium subscribers according to the company.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhYm5vbC5vcmcvY29kZS8yMDA3NC11cGxvYWQtZmlsZXMtdG8tZ29vZ2xlLWNsb3VkLXN0b3JhZ2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Upload Files from Google Drive to Google Cloud Storage with Google Apps Script - Digital Inspiration,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxhYm5vbC5vcmcvY29kZS8yMDA3NC11cGxvYWQtZmlsZXMtdG8tZ29vZ2xlLWNsb3VkLXN0b3JhZ2XSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2673460>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

As we learned to live with COVID-19 in our communities during 2022 the local news focus on my beats centered once again on public health legislative and economic developments.

Forsyth County's largest employer — Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center at more than 13000 workers — became a part of the national healthcare consolidation churn for the second time.

After tying its future in October 2019 to Atrium Health in a ""strategic combination"" featuring a long-sought medical school in Charlotte Baptist became on Dec. 2 part of the nation's fifth-largest healthcare system when Atrium merged with Advocate Aurora to form Advocate Health.

The great debate on Medicaid expansion in North Carolina came close to reaching an agreement between the state House and Senate in June only to be carried over into the 2023 session by Republican legislature leaders.

That meant between 450000 and 650000 potential beneficiaries were forced to wait another year for action as North Carolina remained one of just 12 non-expansion states all with Republican-controlled legislatures.

The stunning overnight collapse of United Furniture Industries Inc. on Nov. 22 permanently closed five Triad facilities — where it was reported to have had between 530 and 600 employees including between 50 and 70 in Winston-Salem. United also eliminated 199 jobs in ending local production in July.

United's shutdown — one of the largest manufacturing job cuts in the nation at 2700 overall — sent employees into a job market offering the promise of other manufacturing employment and the nation's most stringent unemployment benefits.

A major factor of COVID-19 during 2022 involved more Triad residents becoming overwhelmed by medical debt burdens an issue that became heated talking point in the legislature.

A local example was Kernersville resident Alicia Pender whose life turned into a physical and emotional tailspin since her COVID-19 diagnosis in December 2020.

However what is causing Pender the most stress she said is being overwhelmed by more than $30000 in COVID-19 related medical bills.

In April the nearly 18-year saga surrounding controversial Winston-Salem Dr. Anne Litton White came to a conclusion when she closed her practice as part of the indefinite suspension of her medical license issued in March.

White had been the operator of Carolina Laser and Cosmetic Center since 2004.

White has been subject to a board notice of charges and allegations six times before closing her practice the others occurring in 2004 2005 2008 2017 and 2018-20.",,,,,,,,,,,,

This ARM-based Windows laptop succeeds last year's Galaxy Book Go and brings a newer and more powerful Qualcomm processor the Snapdragon 7c+ Gen 3.

Galaxy Book 2 Go with Snapdragon 7c+ Gen 3 has a 40% faster CPU 35% faster GPU

Samsung is claiming the Galaxy Book 2 Go to be a compact-yet-powerful laptop. It comes equipped with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 7c+ Gen 3 chipset that features a 40% faster CPU and a 35% more powerful GPU compared to the Snapdragon 7c Gen 2 that was used in the Galaxy Book Go. The new chipset also brings faster wireless connectivity features including Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2. It also supports faster LPDDR4X RAM (at 3200MHz) and storage (NVMe SSD). Qualcomm also claims that it offers improved AI processing but doesn't dive deeper into the metrics.

This new chipset is fabricated by TSMC on its 6nm node which means it is quite power-efficient as well. It helps laptops last longer on a single charge and Samsung claims that the Galaxy Book 2 Go can last all day or up to 21 hours for video playback. Although the chipset features 5G Samsung seems to have disabled it on its Wi-Fi-only version of the Galaxy Book 2 Go. The company might launch the Galaxy Book 2 Go 5G sometime this year. It runs Windows 11 out of the box and comes with Galaxy ecosystem features like Galaxy Buds Auto Switch Link To Windows Multi Control (a Galaxy tablet) Quick Share Samsung Notes and Second Screen.

The other features of the Galaxy Book 2 Go include a 14-inch IPS LCD display with Full HD resolution and a 180-degree hinge. Looks like it has a tenkeyless keyboard layout a large trackpad and a webcam. Samsung hasn't revealed the RAM storage and battery capacity of its new notebook. It is built to the MIL-STD-810G spec which means it is resistant to drops extreme temperatures humidity shocks and vibrations. It is 15.5mm thin and weighs 1.44kg.

Furthermore the Chinese tech giant has experience with semiconductors since its HiSilicon unit has long produced sophisticated chipsets that competed with MediaTek and Qualcomm in the market for mobile devices.









These new chipsets are being designed and built using process nodes that are less sophisticated than current generation mobile chips after the company lost its main supplier TSMC. For those who are unaware TSMC has already advanced to 4nm and even 3nm process technology. Nevertheless these chips might still be useful for other items like intelligent wearables or even IoT-based appliances. According to the tip some chip models are already being used internally before going on sale.

This disclosure suggests that Huawei is developing less complex but more effective semiconductors. Even more it would support the brand's efforts to develop its resurrected semiconductor footprint. This does not imply however that the corporation has no future ambitions to upgrade to more sophisticated CPUs. The company reportedly won't release such chips for the mobile application processor nodes until 2024.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9nYWRnZXRzLW5ld3Mvc2Ftc3VuZy1nYWxheHktYm9vazItZ28tYW5ub3VuY2VkLXdpdGgtc25hcGRyYWdvbi03Yy1nZW4tMy1jaGlwc2V0LWRldGFpbHMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTY2ODUzMDEuY21z0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2dhZGdldHMtbmV3cy9zYW1zdW5nLWdhbGF4eS1ib29rMi1nby1hbm5vdW5jZWQtd2l0aC1zbmFwZHJhZ29uLTdjLWdlbi0zLWNoaXBzZXQtZGV0YWlscy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTY2ODUzMDEuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Samsung Galaxy Book2 Go announced with Snapdragon 7c+ Gen 3 chipset: Details,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMilAFodHRwczovL3RpbWVzb2ZpbmRpYS5pbmRpYXRpbWVzLmNvbS9nYWRnZXRzLW5ld3Mvc2Ftc3VuZy1nYWxheHktYm9vazItZ28tYW5ub3VuY2VkLXdpdGgtc25hcGRyYWdvbi03Yy1nZW4tMy1jaGlwc2V0LWRldGFpbHMvYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTY2ODUzMDEuY21z0gGYAWh0dHBzOi8vdGltZXNvZmluZGlhLmluZGlhdGltZXMuY29tL2dhZGdldHMtbmV3cy9zYW1zdW5nLWdhbGF4eS1ib29rMi1nby1hbm5vdW5jZWQtd2l0aC1zbmFwZHJhZ29uLTdjLWdlbi0zLWNoaXBzZXQtZGV0YWlscy9hbXBfYXJ0aWNsZXNob3cvOTY2ODUzMDEuY21z?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E4CA9F90>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Mike Leach tributes will be all around the ReliaQuest Bowl on Monday when Mississippi State takes on Illinois at

Raymond James Stadium and crews unveiled the turf tribute for Leach on Sunday night.

A “MIKE” is painted on the field in Mississippi State colors with a cowbell in place of the ‘i’ which is the same design as helmet stickers in Leach’s honor that have been worn by teams around college football this bowl season.

The Bulldogs never hesitated about the issue of playing in the bowl game as they said it’s what Leach would want them to do after he died on Dec. 12 following complications from a heart condition.

Zach Arnett who was promoted from defensive coordinator to head coach 3 days after the death and QB Will Rogers have both said there’s no better way to honor Leach and show their respect for him and his family than to go out there and play a complete game and compete like he would expect. Rogers even referred to that in a hype video ahead of the bowl game.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMipgFodHRwczovL3d3dy5jbGFyaW9ubGVkZ2VyLmNvbS9waWN0dXJlLWdhbGxlcnkvc3BvcnRzL2NvbGxlZ2UvbWlzc2lzc2lwcGktc3RhdGUvMjAyMy8wMS8wMi9taXNzaXNzaXBwaS1zdGF0ZS1mb290YmFsbC1pbGxpbm9pcy1yZWxpYXF1ZXN0LWJvd2wtZ2FtZS1waG90b3MvMTA5ODAwMzAwMDIv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Mississippi State football vs. Illinois: Reliaquest Bowl game photos,"Mississippi State football vs. Illinois: Reliaquest Bowl game photos

It was fitting perhaps that the ReliaQuest Bowl was held at the home of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Monday considering Leach’s long-time affinity for pirates for a game featuring his Mississippi State Bulldogs against the Illinois Fighting Illini.

The Bulldogs had a special pirate-themed decal made in Leach’s memory that adorned the left side of each player’s helmet. Both teams agreed before the game to hold a special moment of silence in Leach’s memory. The game began with Mississippi State on 1st-and-10 from their 25-yard line. Instead of running a play the Bulldogs let the play clock expire taking a delay of game penalty. Illinois per the agreement declined it. Then the moment of silence in Leach’s honor was held and the game began in front of 35797.

However neither team could get rhythm and were forced to punt after three-and-outs on each team’s respective first possession.

The Bulldogs took the field for their second possession on their own 12-yard line. Quarterback Will Rogers tossed a six-yard completion to receiver Austin Williams and then a five-yard pass to receiver Lideatrick Griffin followed by a 12-yarder to Justin Robinson at the Mississippi State 35-yard line. After two incompletions punter George Georgopoulos punted to the Illini 20-yard line with 9:01 remaining in the first quarter to complete a seven play 28-yard drive.

On the first play from scrimmage on Illinois second possession quarterback Tommy DeVito handed off to running back Reggie Love III who rushed left for no gain. On the next play DeVito hit receiver Tip Reiman for an eight-yard reception. Mississippi State safety Jalen Green was hit with a 15-yard face mask penalty which put the ball on the Illinois 43-yard line. Illini receiver Isaiah Williams caught a 21-yard pass to advance into Bulldog territory at the 34-yard line. A false start penalty by left tackle Julian Pearl and a sack by Bulldog defensive tackle Randy Charlton halted the Illini progress forcing kicker Caleb Griffin to attempt a 52-yard field goal. Griffin missed the field goal which went wide to the right. Despite a 10-play 46 yard drive the game was still scoreless with 3:52 remaining in the first quarter.

The teams combined for five incomplete passes and two punts on the next two possessions in the next two minutes.

Mississippi State got the ball back at their 40-yard line with 2:02 left in the quarter and seemed to hit their stride. Lideatrick Griffin caught a four-yard reception. Receiver Rufus Harvey hauled down a 17-yard pass. Austin Williams caught passes of 16-yards and 6-yards respectively. Harvey caught a six-yard pass to make it 1st-and-goal at the 7-yard line. Rogers intended a pass for Griffin but was picked off by defensive back Matthew Bailey at the goal line and returned it to the Illinois 17-yard. The turnover occurred with 13:07 left in the half.

After a rush that resulted in a two-yard loss for Love DeVito hit Isaiah Williams for a 41-yard reception to move the sticks to the Mississippi State 38. DeVito hit receiver Casey Washington for a 13-yard catch on the next play followed by a 9-yard pass to Reiman at the MSU 16. On 2nd-and-goal DeVito ran a quarterback keeper for two-yards for the touchdown. Caleb Griffin’s extra point was good making the score 7-0 in favor of Illinois with 2:49 left in the half.

Mississippi State running back Jo’quavious Marks caught a five-yard pass from Will Rogers to begin the Bulldogs final drive of the half. Justin Robinson then caught a pass for 25-yards. After Marks ran up the middle for five yards wide receiver Jaden Walley threw a 13-yard pass to quarterback Will Rogers on a trick play for a first down. After picking up seven yards on the next three plays the Bulldogs settled for a 38-yard field goal by Massimo Biscardi to make the score 7-3 in favor of Illinois at the half.

Both teams went three-and-out on their first possession to begin the second half. When Illinois got the ball back for their second possession they hit the ground running. Love ran for 15 yards and then caught a seven-yard reception followed by a rush up the middle by running back Josh McCray for four yards to bring the ball close to midfield. Tight end Michael Marchese caught a pass for seven yards to move into Mississippi State territory. McCray ran for five yards and Washington hauled in an 11-yard reception at the MSU 30. Then the drive stalled. An incomplete pass then a loss of two-yards on a short pass to Isaiah Williams which was followed by a Jaden Crumedy sack on DeVito brought another long field goal attempt by Caleb Griffin. This time he booted a 52-yarder through the uprights for the longest field goal in Illinois Bowl game history. In 11 plays covering 45 yards over 5:13 the Illini extended their lead to 10-3 with 6:57 remaining in the third quarter.

The Bulldogs took their time with their next possession. After a false start by Justin Robinson to move them back by five yards he redeemed himself on the next play – a 22-yard strike to their 42-yard line. Lideatrick Griffin hauled in a 12-yard reception in Illinois territory but on the next play right tackle Albert Reese IV was called for a false start. Robinson and Walley hauled in a pair of receptions for eight yards each and Rogers scrambled up the middle for a three-yard gain when the third quarter ended.

On the first play of the fourth quarter 4th-and-2 from the Illinois 8-yard line Rogers hit Justin Robinson in the back of the end zone for the touchdown. Biscardi’s extra point tied the game 10-10 with 14:49 left in the game.

Short yardage rushes penalties sacks and incomplete passes was the story of the next Fighting Illini possession. They ran 11 plays advanced the ball 32 yards over 6:40 and had to settle for a Hugh Robertson punt to the MSU 8-yard line.

The Bulldogs threw to Walley for seven yards and then Price ran up the middle for 14 Marks ran on two consecutive plays for 22 yards and Harvey hauled in a 10-yard reception. It didn’t take long for the Bulldogs to get into Illini territory. Like other possessions during the game things fell apart rapidly. A bad snap from center resulted in a fumble which Will Rogers recovered at the 41 yard line. After two incomplete passes including one that was tipped at the line of scrimmage Mississippi State punted again.

Love rushed to the right for six yards to the Illinois 26 on the first play of Illinois next drive. Washington’s 7-yard reception brought the ball to the 33. Bulldogs linebacker Jett Johnson came up with the big play and sacked DeVito for a 10-yard loss. It was now 2nd-and-20 at the Illinois 23 and DeVito fired a 14-yard pass to Isaiah Williams to recover the loss from the previous play. However he overthrew Williams on the next play and Robertson punted it back to the Bulldogs with 1:50 left on the clock and a tie score.

Rogers and the Bulldogs wasted no time advancing the ball downfield. Lideatrick Griffin hauled in a 19-yard reception. Price gained five yards on a rush up the middle. Walley pulled in a catch for another 10 yards. Price rushed twice for 15 yards before busting one open up the middle for 28 yards to advance to the Illinois two-yard line. In order to better line up a field goal attempt Rogers kneeled down in the middle of the field for a seven-yard loss. Biscardi kicked a 27-yard field goal through the uprights giving Mississippi State a 13-10 lead with just four seconds left.

What happened next is one of the most remarkable plays ever to happen in college football and Bulldogs players and fans might even think it was the spirit of Mike Leach that was behind it.

On the ensuing kickoff Tip Reiman caught the ball at the Illinois 26 and returned it three yards. The Fighting Illini would have only one play to march 71-yards for a touchdown in order to win since with three seconds there wasn’t enough time to advance the ball into field goal range and make the kick.

DeVito took the snap from center and passed right to Casey Washington at the Illinois 43-yard line. Washington lateralled to Isaiah Williams at the Illinois 42 who then ran to the Mississippi State 32. Williams lateralled to Reiman at the MSU 38 who then tipped it back to Washington at the MSU 40. Washington was nearly tackled at the 37-yard line but lateralled it to DeVito at the 39. DeVito in a lateral then threw it across the width of the field to Williams who was waiting at the 35 but the ball hit the turf and was ruled a fumble. It was scooped up by Mississippi State cornerback Marcus Banks at the MSU 40. Banks returned the fumble 60 yards for a game ending touchdown. Mississippi State won the game 19-10 with the last two scores coming in the final nine seconds of the game.

Will Rogers went 29-for-44 with 261 yards one touchdown two interceptions and a quarterback rating of 114.1 to lead the Bulldogs. Jaden Walley threw one pass for 13 yards. Simeon Price ran seven times for 68 yards while Jo’quavious Marks added 50 yards on 10 carries. The Bulldogs ran for 116 yards on the ground and 274 in the air. Justin Robinson led Mississippi State in receiving with seven receptions for 81 yards; Lideatrick Griffin caught five passes for 53 yards; and Walley pulled down five receptions for 43 yards. Justin Robinson was named the game’s most valuable player.

Illinois quarterback Tommy DeVito was 23-for-34 with 193 yards one rushing touchdown and a passer rating of 125.0. Reggie Love III rushed 11 times for 40 yards; Josh McCray picked up 17 yards on seven carries; but DeVito was sacked seven times for a loss of 35 yards. Isaiah Williams caught nine passes for 114 yards and Casey Washington hauled in eight passes for 74 yards to lead the Illini who finished with 193 yards passing and only 22 positive yards rushing.

“I think we did exactly what has been preached for the last three years in this program by Coach Leach” said Mississippi State head coach Zach Arnett who coached his first ever game after being promoted following Leach’s sudden passing. It’s an emotional game obviously. We had a lot to play for today. The thing I don’t want to get lost in this is we had a chance to get to nine wins which I believe … is only the tenth time in school history. So these players have left a legacy on Mississippi State football. I’m incredibly proud of their efforts and their success this season and it’s a perfect springboard into the off-season.”

“Obviously this was a tough one today. This was a defensive battle that probably came down to who had the ball last who was able to execute. Unfortunately we came up short” said Fighting Illini head coach Bret Bielema. “Not taking anything at all away from Mississippi State. They played a great game and played to their strengths and came through in the end.”

Illini wide receiver Isaiah Williams said “They wanted it more than us. Their guys just came with juice I feel like they didn’t really do too much different. We really hurt ourselves on a lot of things too like plays we gotta capitalize missed blocks penalties holding stuff like that I feel like that hurt us in the second half it really wasn’t based on what they did but they did a great job.”

For Mississippi State it was about Coach Leach.

“You know my first half wasn’t my best half. We came out there in the second half and I was standing there on the sideline just having one of those moments” said quarterback Will Rogers. “I don’t know why I thought about it but [I thought] ‘what would Coach tell me right now?’ He would probably tell me to just play the next play keep doing your job and play the next play… We had a little better second half [and] were able to put some drives together to go win a game.”

When asked about what Leach would have told him if he missed the game-winning kick Massimo Biscardi said “He would probably just say ‘I don’t understand cause it’s not that hard. I would just go out there and kick it myself.’ Leach did say that before that he could be out there in the field goal competition.”

Linebacker Jett Johnson summed up what Leach would do if he were in attendance at the game. “He would be really happy. He would be shocked that Will Rogers called pass and he would be swinging the sword for sure. You know it’s a great win for coach Leach and a great start to the Arnett era” he said.

Mississippi State was ranked No. 22 in the nation and finished with a 9-4 record. New head coach Zach Arnett has a record of one win and zero losses. Bret Bielema’s Illinois team fell to 8-5 on the year."

Chinese retailer are now confirming shipments of RTX 4070 Ti Graphics Cards to their warehouses. It looks like the dominant company with deliveries is Colorful who are shipping five custom models already.

Colorful RTX 4070 Ti Graphics Cards

The company will be launching as many as four iGame models and one from BattleAx. The latter has already been leaked by Colorful themselves but the iGame series have not.

Chinese retailers have now confirmed that there will even be a water-cooled Neptune SKU which is nothing really that extraordinary for Colorful in this performance segment. The company already released RTX 3070 under the same series and just like the new model that card was equipped with dual-fan external radiator.

Colorful RTX 4070 Ti iGame Neptune

After looking at numerous listings we rounded up the pricing for Colorful cards to the following.

Colorful RTX 4070 Ti Pricing

Colorful iGame Vulcan OC: 7150 – 7300 RMB

Colorful iGame Neptune: 6999 RMB

Colorful iGame Advanced: OC – 6999 RMB

Colorful iGame Ultra: 6650 – 6700 RMB

Colorful BattleAx: 6500 RMB

It is definitely on a higher side as we could easily find cheaper RTX 4070 Ti cards from companies such as Gigabyte MSI or GALAX at 6200-6500 RMB range. However one should note that the MSRP is 6499 RMB as per Chinese media reports.

Colorful RTX 4070 Ti Graphics Cards

Colorful is one of the largest GPU makers but their cards are sold exclusively in a South Asian region. These photos confirm that the stock of custom cards should be satisfactory to gamers in that region but let’s not forget RTX 4070 Ti is a rebranded RTX 4080 12GB card that was canceled. Both NVIDIA and board partners had time to build up the stock as the SKU was pushed by back by nearly two months.

According to The Verge an American technology news website the company briefly posted the specs for its upcoming RTX 4070 Ti GPU on its website.

However before Nvidia pulled the page down Twitter user @momomo_us was able to snag a screenshot. So far the leaked specifications match those of the 12GB RTX 4080 with 7680 CUDA cores a 2.61 GHz boost clock and 12GB of memory.

Additionally it claims that the GPU is capable of supporting 4K at up to 240Hz and 8K at 60Hz with DSC and HDR as per The Verge.

A chart included shows that the RTX 4070 Ti might outperform the RTX 3080 by almost 3.5 times when playing 'Cyberpunk 2077' in the game's new Ray-Tracing: Overdrive mode.

In October Nvidia faced criticism over its decision to launch the 12GB RTX 4080 GPU under the RTX 4080 moniker because of how much it differs from its much more powerful 16GB counterpart. It led Nvidia to cancel its launch altogether and plan a way to repackage the chip.

As per The Verge pricing for the RTX 4070 Ti hasn't yet been confirmed but some rumors indicate that it will be cheaper than the USD 899 12GB RTX 4080. Nvidia's expected to launch the GPU at CES in January.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiOWh0dHBzOi8vdGVjaG5vc3BvcnRzLmNvLmluL252aWRpYS1nZWZvcmNlLXJ0eC00MDkwLWdwdS01L9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 and GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU Specs leaks Online,"The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 and RTX 4060 Laptop GPUs’ performance benchmarks and specifications have leaked. The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 and RTX 4060 Laptop GPUs should come as no surprise and what’s new is that the RTX 4090’s specifications have been confirmed by Geekbench 5 while the RTX 4060 has been benchmarked within 3DMark.

The NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPU was discovered in an ‘X370SNx’ laptop equipped with an Intel Core i9-13900HX CPU and 32 GB of DDR5 memory. The laptop is outfitted with NVIDIA’s flagship GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU which has the same core specifications as the RTX 4080 (16 GB) Desktop CPU.

There are 76 SM units for a total of 9728 CUDA cores 16 GB of GDDR6 memory and a claimed maximum frequency of 2040 MHz which should be roughly 500 MHz slower than the boost rates for the desktop RTX 4080 graphics card which uses the same AD103 GPU. This corresponds to our exclusive information which stated that the identical chip had a base speed of 1.59 GHz and a boosted rate of 2.04 GHz.

This equates to approximately 40 TFLOPs of compute horsepower which is the same as the RTX 3090 Ti desktop graphics card. The GPU will now have a 150W TGP as well as an additional 25W Dynamic Boost power. Performance measurements will also differ depending on the laptop design so we could see even higher performance estimates on higher-end laptop designs.

In the Geekbench 5 OpenCL benchmark the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU earned 210290 points putting it ahead of the RTX 3090 and within striking distance of the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX graphics card.

This is an excellent performance for a laptop GPU outperforming the fastest graphics cards from the previous generation in a portable form. In addition the RTX 4090 Laptop GPU is 18% quicker than the RTX 4080 Laptop GPU.

credit: wccftech

The second leak concerns the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU which should be a popular mainstream GPU in the mobility category. The GPU will use the AD107 GPU and will have 8 GB of GDDR6 memory spread across a 128-bit bus interface. The graphics chip is expected to have a TGP of 85-140W.

ITHome obtained an alleged screenshot of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU which was found in a locally made ThunderRobot laptop. In terms of performance the GPU achieved 10050 points on the 3DMark Time Spy Graphics bench making it faster than the RTX 3060 Desktop GPU. It is also 20% faster than the RTX 3060 Laptop GPU which has a bigger memory bus but we can’t determine if this is the best or worst-case scenario for performance because the TGP isn’t specified.

Dedicated platforms brands retailers and even media groups offering rental have been riding a post-pandemic wave of parties weddings and nights out cashing in on the sector predicted to be worth over $2 billion by 2025.

Throughout the year new rental offerings were introduced by brands across the price spectrum. On the U.K. high street H&M Marks and Spencer and John Lewis launched rental offerings. And on the luxury end of the market MatchesFashion Rental launched in November. In the U.S. Modern Luxury Media the group behind publications including Jezebel and Hamptons Magazine launched ModLuxRent in October 2022. The rental platform’s styles are curated by its magazine editors. Selfridges which joined the rental market in May 2021 recently shared that it had rented 2000 pieces in the year since its launch.

But fashion rental services haven’t all been success stories. U.K. rental platform Onloan and U.S.-based Seasons both shuttered in February 2022 while both Ann Taylor’s Infinite Style and Banana Republic’s Style Passport rental services have disappeared. After a disappointing IPO in October 2021 Rent the Runway (RTR) laid off 24% of its corporate employees in 2022 as part of a restructuring plan intended to help the business reach profitability. RTR’s stocks had fallen by almost 90% before things started to look up in December following strong third-quarter sales.

Overall the fashion industry is experiencing turbulence. Looking ahead to 2023 ongoing economic uncertainty inflation the climate crisis and low consumer confidence are set to be threats. According to the Business of Fashion’s 2023 State of Fashion report more than half of surveyed fashion executives expect conditions to worsen for the industry in the coming year. While this should concern traditional brands and retailers rental platforms could be in a position of strength.

“Consumer sentiment is poor at the moment” said Eshita Kabra-Davies founder of By Rotation a peer-to-peer fashion rental platform in the U.K. “There is going to be a period of recalibration and reflection on how much people want to spend when they dress up. But long-term the recession will make rental something people choose more commonly.”

Kabra-Davies said By Rotation which leases brands including 16arlington Prada The Vampire’s Wife and Ganni has grown its customer base by nine times in the last year to 300000 registered users.

The platform’s success partly lies in its community. According to Kabra-Davies some “star Rotators” have made £20000 ($24105) a year by leasing their clothes. “Women are becoming friends with each other saving up for their fertility journeys or quitting their jobs after struggling to afford childcare” she said regarding renter success stories.

For rental platforms expanding into resale has also been a popular move — one that By Rotation Hurr Collective and Rotaro all made in 2022. “We had a lot of renters saying they loved renting a dress so much they wanted to buy it” said Kabra-Davies. “The items people are purchasing at resale are very different from the items they’re renting which [shows] the [offerings] satisfy different needs.”

Compared to the bright trendy party looks commonly rented resale items being purchased tend to be timeless investments that users have been able to “try before they buy” she said.

Reflecting on the increasingly saturated rental market Kabra-Davies predicted that it will be the more streamlined businesses that will prove to be recession-proof in 2023. For its part By Rotation doesn’t have warehouses or hold inventory and it has a small team of just seven employees. “Many other startups in this space have more than 30 employees plus it’s a tough fundraising environment” she said. “Having a lean business model where you’re focusing on one thing while not spending too much on it is going to be key to survival.” Indeed Seasons and Onloan both cited warehousing and logistics issues as key reasons for shuttering in 2022.

While dedicated rental companies see it as the future of clothing consumption others are experimenting with the format to meet ambitious sustainability commitments. For Selfridges rental is part of a much bigger circularity strategy that includes resale skin-care and beauty refills and clothing repairs.

Renting clothing can scratch consumers’ shopping itch at a fraction of the cost making it an especially attractive offering in 2023. On Rent the Runway a $1000 JW Anderson bag can be rented for $47 a day. In a 2022 survey the company found that 89% of users reported buying fewer clothes since subscribing indicating the capacity for rental platforms to change consumption habits of users.

The State of Fashion report found that 74% of US shoppers traded down to less expensive options when shopping in 2022 undoubtedly fuelling the rapid growth of fast fashion giants like Shein which was valued at $100 billion this year.

Converting fast-fashion shoppers into renters requires education about the potential environmental benefits of renting versus buying cheaper clothing. In 2021 Finnish scholars released a report in Environmental Research Letters stating that rental has a higher global warming impact than other sustainable options like resale extended use and recycling. The report focused on the emissions from transport and dry cleaning which are pain points for fashion rental companies. The fact remains that too little data-backed independent research has been done to back up the sustainability claims many rental platforms make.

If Rent the Runway’s encouraging third-quarter revenue boost is anything to go by the wider rental market is well-positioned heading into 2023. Consumers are more aware and comfortable with the proposition than ever before allowing rental companies to present themselves as a cost-effective community-led and ethical alternative to shopping. Furthermore rental companies with lean operations could continue to attract investment despite the increasingly tough funding landscape."

According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta wages for employees who stayed at their jobs were up 5.5% in November from a year earlier.

That was up from 3.7% annual growth in January 2022 marking the highest increase in 25 years of recordkeeping the report said.

According to the Journal workers who changed companies job duties or occupations saw even greater wage gains of 7.7% in November from the prior year.

“If I can see that the Burger King down the street is offering $22 an hour and I’m making $20 an hour at the Dunkin’ Donuts that I work at then I know very clearly what my opportunity cost is” Layla O’Kane senior economist at Lightcast told the Journal. “Employers are reacting to that and saying ‘Well we’re going to increase wages internally because we don’t want to lose the staff that we’ve already trained.’”

The prospect that employees might leave for more money is a main reason companies are raising wages for existing employees but faster wage growth is contributing to historically high inflation as some companies pass along price increases to offset their hefty labor costs.

3 Pay raises for employees are putting pressure on inflation which still remains high. AP

Although inflation has cooled slightly in recent months prices spiked at their fastest pace in four decades last year. Federal Reserve officials have said they’re monitoring wage gains as they mull future interest rate increases to slow the economy and bring down inflation. Prices rose 5.5% in November from a year earlier down from a revised 6.1% increase in October.

Even though many workers are raking in more money they aren’t feeling pay gains. According to the Labor Department wages for all private-sector workers declined by 1.9% over the 12 months that ended in November after accounting for annual inflation of 7.1%.

There are also signs that wage gains are starting to cool as the labor market loosens a bit. Average hourly earnings increased 5.1% in November from a year earlier slowing from a March peak of 5.6%. Analysts told the Journal that wage growth could continue to slow in coming months.

3 Consumer prices rose 7.1% in November cooling in recent months. Even so high prices are still hitting consumers’ wallets. Matthew McDermott

In industries with high demand for workers “companies are prepared for wage growth to match inflation” said Paul McDonald senior executive director at Robert Half a professional staffing company. “As inflation comes down it will be more in line with what wage growth has been.”

The consumer price index a measurement of what consumers pay for goods and services rose 7.1% in November — its slowest pace in 2022 — down from 7.7% in October.

In competitive sectors wage pressures will likely continue however. According to a Robert Half survey released in September more than half of professionals feel underpaid and four in 10 workers would leave their jobs for a 10% raise elsewhere.

Broadly speaking pay is increasing for job changers and job stayers because companies can’t find enough help. The Labor Department said job openings — at 10.3 million in October — far exceeded the 6.1 million unemployed Americans looking for work that month.

As a result companies are budgeting more merit-pay increases in 2023 than they have in 15 years in order to incentivize employees according to a Mercer survey of more than 1000 companies.

Daniel Powers a recent college graduate earned a 10% year-end raise at a management consulting firm in Chicago after starting out with a six-figure salary when he was hired in September according to the Journal.

“They understand the realities of the market — there’s no false illusion of ‘We’re family here’” Powers said of his company’s management.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5wb250aWFjZGFpbHlsZWFkZXIuY29tL3N0b3J5L3Nwb3J0cy8yMDIzLzAxLzAyL3JvYmVydC1zbWl0aC1lbmRzLXJ1bi1vbi10b3AtYXMtc2ltZW9uLXN1cnZpdmVzLWJlbmV0LXJhbGx5LWluLXBodC82OTc3MDEyNjAwNy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Smith ends run on top as Simeon survives Benet rally,"Chicago (Simeon) head coach Robert Smith announced some time ago that this would be his final season as the leader of the Wolverines. Winning is the primary thing that his program has done in his tenure.On Friday night Simeon added one more victory to Smith's legacy a record 11th Pontiac Holiday Tournament title with a 52-49 victory over Benet Academy. The victory gave Smith his 11th PHT championship which was also the 16th overall in program history.

It was one that was well earned as Benet made a second-half charge. The Redwings more than doubled their first-half tally in the third quarter alone. They matched their third-quarter out in the fourth to make it a one-score final.

The glory of the outcome was Smith leaving a winner in final game coaching at the PHT. The story was in how Gene Heidkamp's Benet Redwings nearly spoiled the event.

Benet was down 29-13 at the half. The Wolverines were rolling playing so well and at ease that it looked like they would dismantle the third-seed much like they took care of business against St. Charles (North) tourney Pontiac and to a lesser degree fourth-seed Chicago (Curie) in reaching the final.

""We played as poorly as you could play give Simeon all the credit for that"" Heidkamp said of the first half. ""We couldn't make a shot we couldn't stop them defensively.""

But then things changed during the intermission. Whether it was overconfidence or a more determined approach by Benet (probably some of both) the underdogs fought back.

Nikola Abusara converted a three-point play with 5:15 to go in the third quarter. This started a 16-9 run that closed out the period. Brayden Fagbemi connected on a 3-pointer and added a deuce before Abusara scored twice in a 25-second span that drew the Redwings to within single digits at 38-29 with 2:05 left in the frame.

Jalen Griffith the spark plug to the Simeon machine scored in the last five seconds to give the Wolverines a 42-31 lead heading into the fourth quarter.

Guard play has been the catalyst to Simeon's success over the years. Players like Derrick Rose and Kendrick Nunn have provided Wolverine teams with energy that drove them to success. Griffith and backcourt mate Michael Ratliff have ignoted this year's club.

Good size and a deep bench have also been keys to the program's success over the years. Size played a roll in this win but the depth was lacking as Benet kept closing in. Smith stayed with a core group of six players throughout the second half as the lead continued to dwindle.

One of the players who saw plenty of time in the first half was Wesley Rubin last year's AC Williamson Award winner. Rubin didn't leave the bench in the second half.

Relying on strong fundamentals and good shooting Benet kept chipping away at the deficit. Brady Kunka scored with 4:53 left in the game to bring the Redwings to within seven at 44-37. Heidkamp then used a timeout to keep his troops focued and to give them a quick breather.

Parker Sulavar converted a three-point play after nice save from Benet on a rebound and Fagbemi drilled a triple after a Simeon turnover to make it 44-42 game. This pushed Smith into using a timeout with 2:13 left in the game.

Jeshon Liggett scored for the Wolverines on their possession comning out of the break. Benet answered before the Wolverines got baskets from Griffith and Sam Lewis the latter being a dunk to extend the lead to 50-44.

Fagbemi hit a trey for Benet with 19 seconds left and after a Redwings timeout Sam Driscoll got a steal and scored to make it a one-point game with 14 seconds on the clock.

Lewis was fouled on the inbound and drained both free throws for a 52-49 lead. Like a number of shots earlier in the quarter that could have tied the game or created a lead change Benet had a shot keep the game going. However Fagbemi's 3-point try was off the mark and Miles Rubin secured the rebound for Simeon as time ran out.

""Our guys kept plugging along plugging along they never quit"" Heidkamp said. ""We got it to one had a shot to put it over the hump had a shot to tie at the end. Give Simeon a lot of credit they're the best in the state for a reason.""

Simeon scored the game's first five points but Benet responded with five markers to tie the game with 3:16 left in the opening lap. Simeon then reeled off 10 straight to end the quarter and added two more to start the second frame for a 17-5 lead.

It was Griffith burying a triple for the Wolverines that made it 15-5 as time ran out in the first. Simeon then held a double-digit lead until late in the third quarter.

""I wish we would have played better in the first half but it's a tribute to our guys to keep playing against a team of that caliber and have a chance at the end"" Heidkamp said.

Griffith who named this year's AC Williamson Award winner and first-team all-tournament paced Simeon (12-0) with 17 points. Lewis added 15 points and Ratliff contributed 11 points and 8 rebounds.

""We thought we had a pretty good team coming in here and this may vaildate that but we came here to win"" Heidkamp noted.

He nonetheless found it insulting when Robert Lizzie’s father didn’t want to do it either.

That’s just the nature of their relationship.

But she persisted. And eventually Caro a Pulitzer Prize-winning author and her father opened their inner sanctum for “Turn Every Page: The Adventures of Robert Caro and Robert Gottlieb” about the dynamic contentious half-century collaboration behind “The Power Broker” the Zoom-bookshelf must-have about the urban planner Robert Moses and “The Years of Lyndon Johnson” whose fifth volume Caro has been working on for about a decade.

“Why was I reluctant?” Caro 87 asked in a video call from his orderly West 69th Street office.

“We’ve worked out a way of working together” he said. “It’s two people who are I suppose both determined that they stand behind their ideals so firmly that they didn’t want the public to see what that was like.”

What indeed. There was the “terrible situation” when Gottlieb now 91 insisted that 350000 words be excised from “The Power Broker” including the chapter that Caro still thinks is about the best he’s written.

(AP Photo/David Zalubowski)

DENVER – The rim was bent nobody seemed to know how to fix it and for 35 minutes Boston Celtics and Denver Nuggets players struggled to stay warm in a bizarre scene Sunday night that left Celtics star Jaylen Brown fuming.

Boston's Robert Williams III seemed to be the culprit after he hung on the rim following a thunderous dunk with 8:06 left in the fourth quarter. Soon after that rim was leaning a bit to the left.

“I didn't know I did it until my teammates started blaming me” Williams said.

After a timeout with 6:43 left and the Nuggets leading 110-97 in a matchup of NBA conference leaders officials summoned the arena crew to level the rim. At first a couple of workers came out with a ladder and some tools including a level. But there were problems. One crew member got on his phone. Another ladder and more crew members appeared.

Nuggets coach Michael Malone called the situation “a buzzkill.”

“There's a joke in there. How many guys does it take to fix a rim in an NBA game?"" Malone said.

As the delay dragged on players found unique ways to pass the time. Denver's Nikola Jokic and Aaron Gordon jogged from sideline to sideline. Boston's Marcus Smart decided to sit by himself near the opposite free throw line.

The Nuggets tried to entertain the crowd with games on the big screen and a steady diet of hits from the 1980s and ’90s on the sound system. Boston's Grant Williams started dancing to one tune.

At one point a closeup appeared on the video board of a crew member with a level on top of the rim. It showed it was still crooked. The crowd booed as if a referee had just made a bad call against the Nuggets.

“I wish they had just changed the rim right away” Malone said.

Instead the delay stretched to 20 minutes. A worker then took the rim off the backboard to look at it. Players jumped up and down to try to stay warm.

""They said that if it got to a certain amount of time there would be a re-warm-up period"" Celtics interim coach Joe Mazzulla said.

The delay was starting to irk Brown.

“There was no communication” he said.

Finally a worker put the rim back up and it appeared it was level. The crowd roared as the teams ran through layup lines in the middle of the fourth quarter to get loose again.

Soon play resumed but Brown wasn't sure the problem was fixed.

“They spent all that time trying to fix it but when we came back it still looked like it wasn’t even level in my opinion” Brown said. “So we just wasted all that time.”

Jokic had 30 points 12 rebounds and 12 assists as the Nuggets held on for a 123-111 win in a game that ended up lasting 2 hours 40 minutes.

“It was about handling business” said Gordon who scored 18 points.

Brown finished with 30 points for Boston.

“That’s how injuries and stuff happen” he said. “That whole process was handled poorly in my opinion and that had an effect as well. But luckily nobody got hurt.”

If you’re anything like us you’ve likely noticed these bright blue bottles popping up all over the place. In gourmet shops major grocery stores and gas stations. In the cup holders and purses of friends. All over social media. It’s called BIOLYTE — “the IV in a bottle” — and this Atlanta-based company is making unimaginable waves in the recovery drink world.

Inc. Magazine just named the company number 605 on the list of 5000 fastest-growing private companies in America. And that’s largely due to Jesslyn Rollins BIOLYTE’s 30-year-old CEO. Yep 30. Vivacious always smiling and brimming with passion for her product Biolyte and its badass CEO completely exceed the hype and we’re thrilled to welcome Jesslyn as our first FACE of the South in 2023.

Tell us a bit about your upbringing. Were you always entrepreneurial-minded?

The term “entrepreneur” wasn’t the recognizable buzzword it is today when I was growing up. But I have always gravitated towards leadership no matter the setting — church sports social life you name it. I love to lead and improve upon what’s in front of me. I think that’s why leading BIOLYTE was so appealing. A new product no clear pathway forward no hierarchy. The possibilities were endless and that’s SO EXCITING for someone wired like me.

Can you share some background about the founding of this company and how personal it is to your family?

BIOLYTE was created because my mom had breast cancer. My dad wanted to create a product that would help her combat the nausea and dehydration she was experiencing during her chemotherapy treatments. He was uniquely suited to create the first-ever “IV in a bottle” because he had years of experience as an Anesthesiologist and Pain Specialist creating specific IV formulations to help his own patients. Our mission begins and ends with helping the people you love. That’s what gets me out of bed in the morning even on the toughest days.

You have such a joyful online presence. How have you tried to show up digitally as well as in the retail space?

I try to show up for my team in a big way on LinkedIn. They are out there hustling! They’re dropping pallets setting up end caps at stores and loading trucks. I love these people and their dedication to our mission and I want to show it!

When I like heart or comment on their wins it only reinforces to the whole team that we are here to support each other — our team our partners and our customers — like family. Showing gratitude has the power to bring people closer even when they live far away.

If you could go back and tell your “CEO self” one thing on the first day of the job what would it be?

I’m going to borrow a quote from my boy FDR “A smooth sea never made a skilled sailor.”

What’s a typical workday like for you?

Typically I wake up around 6:30 a.m. go for a walk stretch have coffee answer a few emails and then my plan goes up in flames at about 10 a.m. I’m just kidding … or am I? In all seriousness every day is different. My favorite days are when I’m in another state out and about visiting stores meeting with our retail partners distributor partners or potential new hires. My job is to spread the BIOLYTE gospel and any day I’m doing that by meeting new people and building relationships is a win.

Tell us about some moments in life when BIOLYTE can come to the rescue.

BIOLYTE was created to help improve people’s lives with medical-grade rehydration and recovery products. Our customers have found BIOLYTE useful in so many ways. Some we didn’t even expect! Altitude sickness celebrations cancer morning sickness POTS workouts muscle cramps fatigue food poisoning flu COVID and overindulgence just to name a few.

With a current societal shift to drinking less alcohol what do you say to people who may think of BIOLYTE merely as a hangover helper?

In thousands of Amazon reviews customers have tagged BIOLYTE as a “miracle in a bottle” “my saving grace” and “the best drink ever” for a host of different reasons. We aren’t here to tell anyone how to live their lives. We are here to help our customers get the most out of the life they have and want.

What’s something that people are often surprised to learn about you?

I collect gemstones and crystals.

Where can we find you on your days off?

Antique shopping with my mom.

What’s the best advice you’ve ever received and from whom?

I don’t know about the best advice but both of my parents have modeled the power of hard work self-confidence and kindness. Their everyday example has taught me everything. I can only hope to be as wonderful as they are.

Aside from faith family and friends name three things you can’t live without.

A fuzzy robe lipstick and a massage.

Lightning round of fun questions:

Best meal you’ve had recently: My husband cooked an excellent pasta dish from Green Chef.

Eye mask noise machine and a retainer. I’m a super high-maintenance sleeper. Go-to birthday present to give: It’ll be different every time; I like to personalize presents for the person. But if someone is engaged a Bling Brush for their new ring.

“Superior execution at retail and building world-class relationships with our partners” is on the horizon for BIOLYTE according to Jesslyn. And we’re ready. Thank you Jesslyn for sharing BIOLTYE and your story with us! Get ready for a new year and stock up on BIOLYTE here. All photos courtesy of BIOLTYE.

RCL,Royal Caribbean Group,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vbWFyaXRpbWUtZXhlY3V0aXZlLmNvbS9hcnRpY2xlL2NydWlzZS1saW5lcy1vcmRlcmVkLXRvLXBheS00NDBtLWluLWRhbWFnZXMtZm9yLXVzZS1vZi1oYXZhbmEtcGllctIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Cruise Lines Ordered to Pay $440M in Damages for Use of Havana Pier,"A U.S. federal judge on December 30 awarded nearly $440 million in damages plus additional sums for costs to the plaintiffs in a Libertad case over the cruise industry’s use of port facilities in Havana during the three years cruises were permitted to Cuba. While the cruise lines are planning to appeal the decision the case is being seen as a watershed in the long-running fight for compensation for assets seized during the 1959 Cuban revolution and other events around the globe.

U.S. District Court Judge Beth Bloom issued final judgments against Carnival Corporation Royal Caribbean Group Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings and MSC Cruises. Each of the cruise lines is being ordered to pay more than $109 million in damages. The figure was arrived at supporting the nearly $9.2 million claim certified by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission for the Havana Docks Corporation which held the rights to the docks since the 1930s. The judgment also consists of interest which was trebled as punitive damages. The judgments also included varying amounts between $2 million and $3.5 million in attorney’s fees as well as $200000 or more in additional costs in the individual judgments.

The case stems from a 1996 act passed by the U.S. Congress that gave the heirs to assets wrongfully seized and not compensated for their property the right to sue companies that profited from the use of the property. Before Donald Trump every U.S. president had suspended the right to sue for damages but Trump cleared the way for the heirs to the Havana Docks Corporation to sue as well as other similar lawsuits. The U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council reports to date 44 Libertad cases have been filed including other suits against leading commercial shipping companies and others doing business in Cuba.

The cruise lines argued that the case should have been dismissed because they were trading under an exemption issued by the United States as part of President Barrack Obama’s effort to effect change in Cuba by rebuilding relations. After more than 40 years the first cruises commenced in May 2016 and continued until Trump revoked the Obama-era permits in 2019.

The court had previously found that the cruise lines had gone beyond their education permits offering a broad range of traditional tourist activities while passengers were ashore in Cuba. The court cited visits to the beaches and nightclubs as well as a broad range of shore excursions offered by the cruise lines. Court papers report that the cruise lines earned more than $1.1 billion from their cruises and paid $138 million to entities associated with the Cuban government. Judge Bloom said the cruise lines had engaged in “trafficking acts” for which they could be liable for damages under the 1996 Helms-Burton Act known as the Libertad Act.

A spokesperson for Carnival Corporation told the Miami Herald that the company which was the first to send a cruise ship to Cuba in 2016 engaged in lawful travel explicitly licensed authorized and encouraged by the U.S. government at the time. Saying they strongly disagree with both the ruling and now the judgment the spokesperson for Carnival told the Miami Herald that they plan to appeal the decisions.

Finding that the companies had profited from trafficking the assets the judge in March wrote in her opinion that the treasury department licenses did not automatically immune the cruise lines from liability. At issue was the question of what activities were education as required by the permits and if the cruise lines violated that by conducting tourism.

The U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council points out it took 43 months for this first judgment to be ordered on the lawsuits but that it could pave the way for other successful claims. Experts had questioned if any of the suits could ever meet the legal standards to gain a judgment. The Foreign Claims Settlement Commission previously certified over 5900 claims valued at over $1.9 billion.

Of the forty-four Libertad Act Title III lawsuits filed since May 2019 The U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council reports one has been settled for an undisclosed amount while one has reached a court verdict/judgment some have been dismissed some have been appealed to respective Courts of Appeals and two have sought but not received review by the United States Supreme Court.

Obviously you are not alone. It is by far the most popular sport in America with tens of millions tuning into college and NFL games each year.

Of course the popularity of football leads to some big questions for cruisers. Can I watch football on a cruise? What about the college or NFL playoffs? Do cruise ships offer ESPN and other popular stations? How can I watch my local football team on the ship?

When it comes to football we know it’s almost a religion. That’s why we’ve put together this guide to watching both NFL and college football when you’re on your vacation.

Watching NBC Sunday Night Football on a Cruise

These days NBC’s Sunday night game is the biggest of the week. It typically features a nationally important game with two of the best teams in the league. It’s also the most-watched game each Sunday.

If you want to watch Sunday Night Football on your cruise have no fear. This major weekly game will be shown somewhere on the ship. It’s just a question of where.

For major games like this one (or NFL playoffs and the Super Bowl) the ship’s bars will always have the game up. In fact some lines like Carnival (SkyBox Sport Bar) and Royal Caribbean (Playmakers) have dedicated sports-themed bars or other lounges that make a point to show the games.

Most cruise lines will also play the game on the outdoor screen in the pool area. Pull up a chair relax and watch in comfort.

You may or may not be able to watch Sunday Night Football in your cabin. Cruise lines don’t offer NBC on their channel listings or only offer it when the ship is able to receive a signal via satellite or antenna. This means there is a good chance you won’t be able to watch in your room unless there is a signal and the cruise line feeds the game to the cabin TVs.

Elsewhere around the ship it will definitely be showing.

Watching Monday Night Football

Since moving to ESPN Monday Night Football has actually become easier to watch on the ship. Some major cruise lines have a feed of ESPN (usually ESPN International) which will show the Monday night game. However the game may not always broadcast in your stateroom.

Of the major cruise lines Royal Caribbean and Disney offer ESPN in their staterooms. Notably absent is Carnival and Norwegian. At this time the cruise lines don’t offer ESPN in staterooms.

That said we have yet to see a major cruise line without a feed that will show the game in sports bars and somewhere else around ship such as the large outdoor pool screen (if equipped).

Watching Thursday Night Football

When it comes to Thursday night games it can be tougher to watch but not impossible. That’s because the game has moved exclusively to Amazon Prime and is now streamed instead of playing over the air on a traditional channel.

For that it’s not clear if cruise ships offer a viewing option for the game. For instance bars and restaurants on land can stream with DirectTV however that’s not what is offered on cruise ship.

The good news is if you are an Amazon Prime member then you should be able to stream personally.

With Amazon Prime now livestreaming Thursday night games it does offer the option to watch in your cabin (or anywhere around the ship) if you have a laptop tablet or other device. But to do so you will need to be a Prime member and have Internet service on the ship that allows for streaming. This is typically the highest-tier wi-fi package on the ship.

Bottom line: The game may be broadcast around the ship. Worst case scenario you can stream it to your device.

Watching Sunday Afternoon Local Games

If your favorite team plays a regular Sunday game (not a nationally broadcast game) then you’ll have the most difficulty watching them play on a cruise ship.

The cruise line will definitely be broadcasting football throughout the ship’s bars during Sunday afternoon but it will be subject to availability of the satellite feed. So if your team is only one game of a multi-game regional feed you’ll have to get lucky that their game is being featured aboard the ship.

You are unlikely to receive the Sunday local games in your cabin unless you are on a cruise line that offers FOX/CBS and receiving a broadcast feed.

That said we have sailed Royal Caribbean during football season and they had multiple Sunday afternoon games going at once in the cabin staterooms. Other cruise lines seem to have fewer options.

Watching NFL Playoffs & Super Bowl

If cruise lines show regular season NFL games while sailing then you know the playoffs will be easily accessible. What’s also good is that since few playoff games overlap and they are all big games you don’t have to miss any of the action. Each will be given its due.

Games like the playoffs and Super Bowl will definitely be shown at sea. Like regular season games you’ll be able to find them in places like the casino sports bars lounges or other hangout around the ship. They may or may not be shown in your cabin.

But when it comes to the biggest games — especially the Super Bowl — the cruise line will put on watch parties complete with refreshments. In short it’s a big event even in the middle of the ocean.

You can read more on watching the Super Bowl on a cruise here.

Watching College Football on a Cruise

Are you a college football fan taking a cruise during the season? You don’t have to miss your team just because you are sailing on a Saturday.

Similar to the NFL expect college games to be broadcast around the ship — especially in the sports bar (if available). For instance we’ve visited Royal Caribbean’s Playmakers during a Saturday in the fall and there were multiple games showing during primetime.

As a rule of thumb the bigger the game the more likely you are to be able to see it on the ship. Ohio State versus Michigan? It’s likely to be shown around the ship. Ohio State versus Bowling Green might be harder to find.

Of course college football is shown across multiple channels including FOX ABC CBS and ESPN. The TV feeds in the stateroom are unlikely to have all of these channels but could have some available.

Your best bet for watching it to check out the bars around the ship if it’s a bigger game or trying to stream the game on your own device (see below).

What About Streaming Football Games Via Prime Sling or ESPN?

It’s an exciting time in television in that you can barely call it TV anymore. Now people are streaming to all sort of devices using all sorts of services. These allow you to take your shows with you anywhere you go and watch them on your phone tablet or computer.

In many cases you can stream apps like Amazon Prime or EPSN to watch games on the cruise. However be ready for some possible hiccups.

First is the internet connection while at sea. Cruise lines all offer Internet service but it can be difficult to have a great connection at sea. Weather location and the number of people using the service can all impact the picture quality.

As well some ships don’t allow streaming services which kills any hope of streaming a game to your device. However this is (thankfully) becoming more rare. Generally you will have to purchase the highest-tier Internet package to access streaming services so be prepared.

One other thing to watch for? Many streaming apps have location filters on them meaning that if you are connecting from a place outside of the United States then you may be blocked from accessing your subscription.

So yes you can stream on a cruise but it might be pricey and there are some technical issues that might come up. In general however we’ve never had any major problems being able to stream making it a great option.

Best Options for Watching Football on a Cruise

Unfortunately with so many games and so many channels it’s impossible to say if the football game you want to watch will definitely be shown on the cruise. However if it’s a big game then there is almost surely a way to watch from one of a few options:

Around the Ship: For big games like NFL playoffs primetime college games and Sunday Night Football expect the game to be shown somewhere around the ship. This can include bars or the pool deck big screen. This is the simplest and most reliable way to watch.

Cabin Stateroom: Cruise lines are hit or miss on major networks or ESPN access in the cabin. So you may or may not get to watch the game in the room. That said we have been on a Royal Caribbean cruise during an NFL Sunday when several games were displayed in the cabin despite not normally having those channels.

Streaming: Likely your best bet for college games shown on ESPN or other channels. You will need to have an Internet package on the ship and the app for the network showing the game. Keep in mind that location issues and Internet speed may cause possible hurdles. Not every ship allows streaming but most do."

Duke University/Instagram Jerry Seinfeld gives the commencement address at Duke University on May 12 2024

Jerry Seinfeld has some apologies to offer nearly two decades after the release of Bee Movie.

On Sunday May 12 the Seinfeld alum 70 gave a commencement address to the graduating seniors at Duke University in Durham North Carolina — where his son Julian currently attends and his daughter Sascha previously graduated from.

During his speech the comedian took time to reflect on his 2007 animated film Bee Movie — specifically one controversial element of the storyline.

""I made a cartoon movie about bees you may have watched as a child"" Seinfeld said in a video captured by an attendee and shared on TikTok.

""If any of you felt slightly uncomfortable about the sexual undertones in the relationship between Barry B. Benson and Vanessa the florist who saves his life I would like to apologize for that now"" he continued earning laughs from the crowd. ""I may not have calibrated that perfectly.""

Fans of the DreamWorks kids' movie have previously made long-running jokes about the romantic tension between Seinfeld's character in the film Barry (a bee) and Renée Zellweger's character Vanessa (a human). Back in October 2021 Seinfeld addressed the same issue during an appearance on The Tonight Show apologizing once again for the innuendo.

""I apologize for what seems to be a certain uncomfortable subtle sexual aspect of the Bee Movie"" he said at the time. ""[It] really was not intentional but after it came out I realized this is really not appropriate for children. Because the bee seems to have a thing for the girl and we don’t really want to pursue that as an idea in children’s entertainment.""

Seinfeld's commencement speech at Duke also drew public attention when anti-war protesters walked out of the ceremony and booed from the audience when the TV star took the podium according to NBC News and CBS News.

Seinfeld has been making a slew of public appearances in recent weeks in support of his newest movie Unfrosted which marks his feature-film directorial debut. Speaking with PEOPLE at the premiere of the movie on April 30 Seinfeld opened up about taking on the role of director for the first time in his career.

""You don't want to think about that this is a really big important job. Like the pilot never wants to come on the PA system and go 'I'm going to try and get this plane in the air.' You have to be confident"" he said.

Seinfeld previously told PEOPLE that he has ""been obsessed with Pop-Tarts my whole life"" which is what inspired him to take on the movie.

""My friend Spike Feresten who was a writer on my show and is still a good friend of mine thought we should make a movie out of the story the real story which we did"" he explained.



Unfrosted — which features a star-studded cast including Melissa McCarthy Jim Gaffigan Hugh Grant and more — is set in 1963 Battle Creek Mich. when ""Kellogg's and Post sworn cereal rivals race to create a pastry that will change the face of breakfast forever"" according to a synopsis.

It is worth noting that then Kings XI Punjab pacer Sreesanth and former Mumbai Indians captain Harbhajan Singh had a heated altercation during a match between the two sides. Harbhajan slapped Sreesanth and the latter ended up crying. The action saw Harbhajan facing a ban from the rest of the tournament in that edition. While speaking on 'The Ranveer Show' Sreesanth said that he didn't cry because of the pain but the bond he has had with Harbhajan.

""If you look at it it was a 30-second video or something but media showed it as if..."" said Sreesanth before the host added that it became the biggest IPL news. ""Yeah yeah. Unbelievable. So I will say Bhajji pa. Even now I address him as 'Bhajji pa' and he is somebody who is always... Whenever I had any important spell or something I was not doing well I used to go and hug Bhajji pa. And somehow it is the vibration or maybe the positivity which paaji has got I always used to get the performance out.

""So when that incident happened I was shocked. I didn't cry because of pain but because of heart. I could not take the fact that he would do it and I was not worried about who was watching. So maybe the kid in me as a younger brother if an elder brother was shouting and he had all the right because before the game he had actually told me that don't go overboard with your aggression against us.""

Sreesanth also made a huge revelation about his time with the national team.

""All my life I have been.... I can say it. See anything below Bombay was more like Madrasi. I have been hearing it from the time I was playing Under-13 to Under-14 to Under-16 to Under-19.

Now to say this upfront you do pay a premium for the licensing. For example I’m testing the Shuri drive featuring the popular Black Panther character and it’s a 2TB 2.5-inch FireCuda device that’s about $30 more than a FireCuda without licensing. However I’m going to say that if you’re a fan of the particular property it’s actually worth it.

This is not a cheap sticker or lazy plastic print that Seagate has thrown onto a thin plastic shell. There’s texturing across the surface and the device itself feels solid and premium to hold. Additionally the LED lighting effect under the surface when powered on adds to the aesthetic appeal. Seagate really has gone the extra mile to ensure that these special editions are a celebration of the property and given that there are now not only Black Panther but Star Wars Spider-Man Xbox and PlayStation-themed editions chances are that if you’re a gamer there’s going to be at least one of these that does have a favourite character on there for you.

The only question is whether it’s actually worth paying for. I’ve plugged my Shuri drive into the PlayStation 5 to be my storage device for PS4 games. Consequently it sits on the shelf next to the console and I barely look at it. If I were to use it as additional PC storage it would be more prominent in my day-to-day workspace but even in that situation do I believe there is an inherent value of $30 in having this character on my storage media? I’m not the world’s biggest fan of Shuri (or Black Panther or Marvel in general) so on a personal level I wouldn’t bother. I don’t care for this drive specifically any more than any of the drives that I have that are plain black boxes (or have stickers I’ve stuck on them myself).

However if Seagate were to produce a series that was licensed to something that I actually care about I would be sorely tempted. If there was a Hatsune Miku drive with the same customisable LED (so I could make the lighting turquoise like Miku’s hair) then I could easily see myself grabbing one because it would sit alongside the Miku figures in my workspace very nicely.

The device itself is exceptional and Seagate is always a reliable choice for storage. In addition to feeling solid and robust the FireCuda 2TB has a USB 3.2 interface for reasonably fast data transfer (around 130 MB/s for both read and write) and is fully compatible with both PlayStation and Xbox devices. You simply plug it in allow the console to do the formatting and you’re ready to go. If you’re planning to use it as PC storage you can also take advantage of some simple backup and recovery software that Seagate provides on its devices as standard.

As mentioned I use it as PlayStation storage and once you’ve formatted the drive to that purpose that is all you’re going to be able to use it for. There is an additional caveat here that the PlayStation 5 doesn’t allow the launching of PS5 games off external storage. PS5 games need the additional speed of the storage housed within the device and wouldn’t function properly off any external media. However PS4 games are a different story and by moving your PS4 games to this storage you can free up the internal data for just your PS5 library. 2TB is a large enough amount of storage to hold dozens of games and is especially worthwhile if you’re taking advantage of Sony’s PSPlus subscription service and therefore have access to a lot of games.

Too often licenses are handled cheaply by tech companies. They’re something that’s cynically thrown on the package to sell a few extra units to suckers. Ultimately those disappoint the true fans of the properties who carefully collect all the merch they can. The good news with this special edition series is that Seagate has put in the effort and actually engaged with designers and artists to make the device worthy of the license. You pay a premium but get a hard drive that looks like it belongs next to the other merch that you might own. And because the hard drive itself is also of very high quality this is one of those times where paying a premium doesn’t feel like an insult anyway.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Or follow us on Google News

Here at CleanTechnica we’ve written a great number of articles about Vehicle-To-Grid (V2G) technology. It’s highly important not only to help stabilize the grid (thousands of EVs can help the grid keep up during unusual times using energy from times when the grid wasn’t so strained) but V2X (vehicle to X) can do anything from power a campsite to power a heater and a fridge during severe winter storms where power was lost.

So it’s a good idea for more manufacturers to support V2G and V2X technology and many are doing it. But Toyota only recently got back into EVs so the company is having to get into that now.

A couple weeks ago Toyota Motor North America and Oncor Electric Delivery a Texas-based electric transmission and distribution company have collaboratively established an unprecedented Vehicle-to-Grid technology pilot project. Spearheaded by Toyota’s Electric Vehicle Charging Solutions team this endeavor is the first of its kind between a public utility in the US focused on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs). Together they are making strides to bring cutting edge energy solutions into reality — marking an important milestone for both companies!

Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC headquartered in Dallas is a regulated electricity distribution and transmission business that ensures reliable power delivery to over 3.8 million homes and businesses with its superior asset management skills. With more than 140000 miles of transmission and distribution lines across Texas Oncor (alongside its subsidiaries) manages the largest network system in the state. Oncor is owned by two investors Sempra (indirect majority owner) and Texas Transmission Investment LLC (minority owner) but its Board of Directors are in charge of overseeing the management. This board consists mainly of independent directors.

With the findings from this research Toyota and Oncor are equipped to more effectively support electric vehicle charging infrastructure in America. Additionally these efforts will enable them to provide a better customer experience for all BEV purchasers of Toyota vehicles reduce carbon emissions faster than before and open up new business opportunities as well.

“We envision a future where Toyota BEVs provide a best-in-class mobility experience but also can be utilized by our customer to power their homes their communities or even power back the electric grid in times of need” said Christopher Yang group vice president of Toyota Electric Vehicle Charging Solutions team. “Our collaboration with Oncor is an important step for us to understand the needs of utilities as we plan to work closely with them to ensure every community can embrace Toyota’s shift to electrified vehicles.”

To kickstart their joint research project Oncor and the other company have agreed to use Oncor’s advanced microgrid located at its System Operating Services Facility (SOSF) in south Dallas. This area is conveniently situated just south of Toyota’s national headquarters. The remarkable SOSF microgrid consists of four interconnected grids that can be individually manipulated or combined into a single large system for improved operation.

To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the link between BEVs and utilities Toyota and Oncor have included a V2G charger solar panels battery storage as well as a BEV in their microgrid system. These elements will be used for testing and evaluation purposes.

“Electrification is coming and it’s Oncor’s job to build a safer smarter more reliable electric grid that can enable the needs of our customers the state of Texas and the ERCOT market. This project marks the first collaboration of its kind between Oncor and an OEM manufacturer and we are excited to work with a world-class technology leader like Toyota to better understand how the electric grid can enable V2G transactions across the Oncor service territory” said Jim Greer Oncor Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. “We appreciate Toyota’s collaboration in pursuing innovative energy solutions through this endeavor and we look forward to someday implementing the lessons learned from this pilot project in benefit of the many communities we serve.”

Subsequent to the initial phase of this project in 2023 a V2G pilot will be instated with BEVs connected at residences or companies within Oncor’s service area. This process and agreement must adhere to all standard interconnection regulations.

By collaborating Oncor and Toyota will gain a more comprehensive understanding of their customers’ present and future needs. This new insight will aid in the swift expansion of electric vehicle charging infrastructure fulfill customer requirements with precision better support electric vehicles and accurately assess V2G’s impact on the electricity grid.

The Bigger Question

One question I don’t see addressed very often and that Toyota may be able to help address is how they’ll get EV owners to participate in concerted V2G efforts.

One challenge V2G efforts will face is fear of degradation. The more you use a lithium-ion battery the more capacity it’ll lose. At what price will participation be seen as a net benefit for a car owner? The answer to that is probably something economists can study but it’s no simple answer. Different people will have different ideas about how much risk they’re willing to take with their car different levels of community-mindedness and more.

Along those same lines the Texas freezes probably highlight another issue: whether people will want to help the grid or help their own families first with that EV power. It’s becoming increasingly well-known that EVs and hybrids can supply power in emergencies and this is literal life or death stuff. Will Texas EV owners want to help the grid stay up or will they want to give their own family heat first in a nasty cold snap?

I don’t want to get into politics or other nasty things but these things are worth looking at productively now before they’re an issue in the heat (or cold) of the moment. Instead of deciding who to blame after a big freeze doesn’t go according to plan companies working with EVs utilities and V2G projects in Texas need to think now about making sure there’s nothing to blame anybody for next time.

We know that jerks like Greg Abbott will lie about EVs renewables and energy storage regardless of what we do but that doesn’t mean we need to make it easy for them!

Tulane earned a shocking upset over USC in the Cotton Bowl but Caleb Williams still put on a show in the 46-45 loss.

The Heisman Trophy winner set a new Cotton Bowl record with five touchdown passes totaling 460 yards on 36-of-51 passing.

His mobility in the pocket was especially impressive on multiple eye-catching plays.

Though the quarterback isn't eligible for the 2023 NFL draft Williams' play has fans already looking ahead to 2024 with the possibility of tanking all next season to get the No. 1 pick.

Many fans were already comparing Williams to NFL MVP favorite Patrick Mahomes.

It's high praise but the upside is apparent after a dominant 2022 season after transferring from Oklahoma. Williams totaled 4075 passing yards with 37 touchdowns in 13 games entering the day throwing just four interceptions. He also added 372 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns helping him run away with Heisman Trophy voting.

Of course he can't do it all and the rest of USC wasn't quite as impressive on Monday.

Tulane averaged 13 yards per pass attempt and nine yards per rush against a Trojans defense that struggled mightily. Add in some special teams mistakes and the Green Wave were able to overcome a 15-point deficit in the final five minutes.B",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvNi1raXRjaGVuLXBhaW50LXRyZW5kcy1jb25zaWRlci0xNDAwMDA1MDAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,6 Kitchen Paint Trends to Consider in 2023,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.yahoo.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /lifestyle/6-kitchen-paint-trends-consider-140000500.html (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E5069240>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnlhaG9vLmNvbS9saWZlc3R5bGUvNi1raXRjaGVuLXBhaW50LXRyZW5kcy1jb25zaWRlci0xNDAwMDA1MDAuaHRtbNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWlseS1zb3V0aHRvd24vbmFtZS9qYW1lcy1mYW9yby1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zODUwNjI5OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,James Faoro Obituary (2023) - Chicago Heights IL - Daily Southtown,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmxlZ2FjeS5jb20vdXMvb2JpdHVhcmllcy9kYWlseS1zb3V0aHRvd24vbmFtZS9qYW1lcy1mYW9yby1vYml0dWFyeT9pZD0zODUwNjI5OdIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E5069690>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Both were “experiences.”

At Nobu New York we were seated adjacent to Billy Crystal who wanted no part of being recognized but nonetheless so freaked out by it couldn’t concentrate on the food. In Nobu Aspen/Matsuhisa I was worried about entertaining guests vis a vis the astounding bill for small portions. Again it was all about the “experience” ergo people “who can’t afford it” should be prepared.

Buckhead Atlanta scores both the restaurant and the Nobu Hotel making us all the more privileged. On Nov. 30 I attended the grand opening at Nobu Hospitality as local dignitaries and community leaders cut the ribbon on the back side of Phipps Plaza near Saks Fifth Avenue. The property serves as Nobu’s 15th location overall and first in Georgia making its debut in Buckhead at the modern re-imagined mixed-use Phipps Plaza.

Designed by Rockwell Group the hotel features 152 guest rooms and suites including a rooftop pool with surrounding event space corporate conference rooms and a state-of-the-art fitness center with Technogym equipment. Nobu Atlanta Restaurant celebrated for its signature new-style Japanese cuisine now welcomes diners to the new 10000 square-foot space serving iconic Nobu dishes alongside specialties featuring local homegrown ingredients.

“It’s an honor to launch the Nobu brand in Atlanta’s vibrant Buckhead community at Phipps Plaza” said Nobu Hospitality Group CEO Trevor Horwell. “Our approach to hospitality embracing sophisticated accommodations and outstanding cuisine will offer guests the ultimate luxury lifestyle experience in the heart of Atlanta.”

As malls like Cumberland and North Point search to redefine themselves edging away from the straight retail sector Phipps Plaza is also striving for more “work play and shop” options. In early December Life Time and Life Time Work will open its 90000 square-foot luxury athletic country club and 30000 square-foot premium co-working destination. This is an addition to the now open One Phipps Plaza a 365000 square-foot LEED certified 13-story Class A office tower. Early next year Citizens Culinary Market a 24000 square-foot upscale lifestyle food concept is scheduled to open injecting new culinary concepts into Phipps’ unique lineup. Remember Atlanta favorite Alon’s Bakery & Market is on the Peachtree Street side.

Simon Property Group Senior Vice President Development and Asset Intensification Patrick Peterman said “We’re excited to celebrate the opening of Nobu Hotel & Restaurant Atlanta as our vision of Phipps Plaza becomes a reality for guests to enjoy from the Southeast and beyond. Nobu’s unique allure and high-end reputation reinforces Phipps Plaza as a world-class destination for hospitality shopping dining work and entertainment.”

Thinking about booking a wedding b’nai mitzvah or conference? Group and event sales manager Samantha Hertzig noted “One of the exciting events we have booked for the summer of 2023 is a large Indian wedding. We also have slated a few events with National Sales Network in 2023. Recently we have hosted Caesars Entertainment Assent Inc Cartessa Edwards Lifesciences WestRock Baker Donelson and Associated Luxury Hotels International.”

Nobu Atlanta also has private dining options. The Private Room can accommodate up to 24 guests while the Sake Room accommodates up to 12 guests. In-room dining is also available for guests looking to dine in privacy. Guests can expect to find signature Nobu menu items as well as dishes reflecting local culture and cuisine.

Not the former panel beater who came from nowhere to become one of the biggest gaming tsars in the country with casinos in Alice Springs and Canberra.

“It’s got to be thick enough but not gluey. It’s got to be crunchy enough but not undercooked” she said of the porridge. And when she finally got her hands on a bag after weeks of waiting she realised how quickly the skill can atrophy.

“It smells the same. It tastes the same. It feels the same” said Metzger who runs walking tours of Ontario’s Waterloo region. “But I’ll need to cook a few more bowls before I get it right.”

Metzger and Canadians across the country have been out of practice ever since the beloved cereal was abruptly discontinued by its makers the JM Smucker Company in 2021 because of poor sales.

The announcement was met with an outpouring of disbelief frustration and grief that belied the simple – even bland – makeup of the cereal.

But it’s been a bad few years for beloved foodstuffs in Canada. Earlier this year two well-loved cream cheese brands were also discontinued casualties of a ruthless market and a further erosion of items that occupy a space in the intersection of nostalgia and routine for Canadians.

A local grocery store called the loss of Western Family cream cheese a “devastating blow”. Canada’s national newspaper published an elegy for another cheese brand soon after following the demise of Montreal’s prized Liberté spread– a particularly galling travesty in a city renowned for its bagels.

And so the unlikely return of Red River in recent months after the rights were acquired by a small Ontario mill marks a rare bright spot for lovers of the viscous – and divisive – hot cereal.

Concocted in Gertrude Skilling’s Winnipeg kitchen in 1924 after she experimented with a range of grain mixtures grown in the Red River valley it soon appeared on grocery store shelves and quickly became a pantry staple sold through the Red River Grain Co which Skilling’s husband was president of.

“I think of Red River as sort of like the Vegemite of Canada; either you like it or you don’t but it’s iconic” said Julie Lalonde an Ottawa-based writer whose parents were staunchly divided over the cereal: one loved it the other was repulsed by it.

“Just watching someone make it you’re thinking something went wrong in the process. There’s no way it’s edible. But it’s addictive and you’ll never find a hardier breakfast.”

The simple red cardboard box has long occupied a ubiquitous place in the memories of Canadians. It fuelled backcountry excursions into the wilderness hunting trips with friends and a much-needed dose of warmth on bitterly cold winter mornings.

“It never tried to be fancy. It was never trying to claim 500 health benefits or anything like that. It just seemed like it was trying to be birdseed but for people” said Lalonde. “In a way it was ahead of its time.”

And so when it became difficult for her and others to find it on grocery store shelves she sensed something was wrong.

“Customers kept coming in and asking for this cereal” said Mark Rinker who recently purchased Arva Flour Mill the oldest water-powered flour mill in North America and its small shop. “I didn’t know much about it but I guess we used to carry Red River. And so I made a note to look into it.”

The requests kept coming and Rinker soon learned that amid waning sales the JM Smucker Company the American conglomerate that acquired Red River in the 1990s was shutting down production.

On social media Canadians mourned the death of the cereal but also shared stories of how it had occupied a central spot in their morning routines. Others desperately searched for a replacement.

Seeing the demand in the community Rinker approached the company to acquire the rights to the brand. And in July he announced Arva would begin producing Red River.

“I was totally blown away by the strong emotional attachment that people have with the brand. There was no way that we could have anticipated how people would react” he said. “It was almost visceral.”

His inbox was flooded.

“I’d get paragraphs from people recounting how and where they would consume the cereal. It often feels like they would eat at the happiest point of their day early in the morning with the cereal bringing warmth to their body” he said.

“It doesn’t matter if the person is from the Maritimes Quebec Ontario or western Canada or the US. They all have this really strong bond with it.”

For Lalonde it reflected simplicity and familiarity – two feelings upended in recent years by the coronavirus pandemic.

“You’d eat it with your family. And so many people haven’t been able to see family as much. It harkens back to a time when you felt like you could just take a breath and enjoy your gooey birdseed cereal and not be constantly stressed out and have things taken away from you.”

In late November when the Canadian Broadcasting Company (CBC) reported that Arva was preparing to ship the revamped product Rinker said “demand went through the roof” – and the company is still struggling to keep pace with the orders. Customers eager to get their hands on a bag have been left waiting weeks.

One of those was Metzger who had ordered five bags. She planned on keeping some for herself and sharing the rest with family and friends.

At first she was disappointed to see Red River arrive in a plastic bag not its usual cardboard box. But the familiar smell and texture of the grainy breakfast reassured her – as did the way in which it has returned to its roots.

“I think when it disappeared people lost both the product and their daily routine. I love that it’s back in Canada and it’s being produced at a small local mill” she said. “I love that it’s back. And I love that it’s home.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtY29mZmVlLWJyYW5kcy1sb3dlc3QtcXVhbGl0eS1pbmdyZWRpZW50cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,9 Coffee Brands To Always Leave On Grocery Store Shelves,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.eatthis.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news-coffee-brands-lowest-quality-ingredients/ (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E2988220>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiRmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL25ld3MtY29mZmVlLWJyYW5kcy1sb3dlc3QtcXVhbGl0eS1pbmdyZWRpZW50cy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",,,,,,,,,

. Record your video then swipe down to the notification panel to pause the music.

Watch and listen to your video preview and post it if you're happy with it.

This article explains how to add music to your Snapchat videos and stories. Instructions apply to the most recent version of Snapchat for iOS and Android.

How to Send Snapchats With Music

The addition of a music feature in Snapchat is something that brings it more up to speed with other competing social video apps particularly Instagram. Prior to this update if you wanted music to play in your Snapchat videos you needed another device or computer to play it. Here's how it works.

Open up your favorite music app and play any track you want. Whether it's iTunes Spotify Pandora SoundCloud or any other app as long as it plays music on your phone you can use it with Snapchat. Keep in mind that Snapchat records the music at a pretty high volume so consider turning it down in your music app if you want your own voice or other background sounds in your video to be heard through the music. Launch Snapchat (with the music still playing) navigate to the camera tab and hold the big record button down to record your video message. It will record all the music your device is playing at the same time. Before sending or posting your video swipe down from the top of the screen and use the notification panel to pause the music. Then go back to Snapchat to watch/listen to your video preview. If you're happy with your video preview and the music playing along with it go ahead and post it. Check out some of the fun lenses with built-in music tracks. Snapchat has been including more lenses like this some of which feature new singles from popular artists which automatically start playing music as soon as you activate the lens.

Arnold Schwarzenegger never fails to amuse his audience. Whether his performance is about bodybuilding acting in fictional roles or making hilarious shorts ex-Mr. Olympia keeps us entertained.

Jorge Masvidal’s post was a tribute to the video posted by Schwarzenegger on his Instagram account.

The grants will leverage $1.1 million in matching contributions to generate a total conservation impact of nearly $2.2 million.

The grants were awarded through the Southeast Aquatics Fund a competitive grant program and public-private partnership. Support for the fund comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Forest Service the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Southern Company and the Altria Group.

“This year’s grant slate represents a major step forward in conserving the incredible aquatic biodiversity of Southeastern rivers and streams” Jeff Trandahl NFWF executive director and CEO said in a news release. “Once implemented this array of projects will improve and restore habitats to aid numerous species and provide critical information to help guide future investments to support ongoing voluntary conservation efforts.”

Projects will take place within priority watersheds of the Alabama Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint and Mobile-Tombigbee river basins in Alabama and Georgia and the Pee Dee river basin in North Carolina. Guided by NFWF’s Longleaf Forest and Rivers Business Plan the projects will address key threats affecting the freshwater habitats and species in these watersheds supporting the tremendous aquatic biodiversity of the Southeastern region.

In Alabama grants from Southern Company will support two projects: One is a partnership with Auburn University for a study in the Uchee Creek watershed of Russell County to support future restoration and habitat improvement. The second grant in partnership with The Nature Conservancy will support research and restoration work in the watershed of the Upper Locust Fork of the Black Warrior River.

“The Southeast Aquatic Fund grants will directly benefit Alabama communities by helping support aquatic species and habitat conservation in priority watersheds” said Susan Comensky vice president of Environmental Affairs at Alabama Power. “Support for key partners like The Nature Conservancy and Auburn University is critical to protecting Alabama’s natural resources.”

“Supporting the Southeast Aquatics Fund is one way we do our part to restore critical watersheds” said Jesalyn McCurry Southern Company environmental stewardship manager. “Focusing on freshwater conservation produces work that is good for species water and communities.”

Overall the NFWF grants in Alabama Georgia and North Carolina will improve more than 2600 acres of working lands and riparian habitat and benefit a host of aquatic species including the Black Warrior waterdog flattened musk turtle bridled darter trispot darter blue shiner Alabama rainbow and Coosa creekshell.

“The Forest Service is proud to support the Southeast Aquatics Fund. This ongoing partnership benefits the region’s remarkable aquatic biodiversity” said Ken Arney Forest Service regional forester for the Southern Region. “Partnering with private landowners is key to habitat restoration which results in greater strides toward species recovery.”

“The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is proud to support aquatic conservation efforts in the species-rich region of the Southeast” said Leopoldo Miranda-Castro the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s regional director for the South Atlantic-Gulf and Mississippi Basin regions.

“Restoration efforts in these focal areas will help recover several listed species and conserve many at-risk species that can only be found in this region. These efforts also help to keep forests and other lands working for our partners in conservation.”

Launched in 2017 the Southeast Aquatics Fund supports voluntary watershed-based restoration and management to improve the health of aquatic systems and secure populations of native freshwater aquatic species. Including this year’s grants the program has awarded $8 million to 38 conservation projects expected to benefit nearly 500000 acres of working lands and riparian areas and over 60 miles of stream habitat.

As the tale goes Charles Little was an eccentric guy who had a bathtub in his house specifically for testing new beverage concoctions. If something was deemed good by family and friends he would fine tune it and take it to a captive audience on the Chattanooga railroad. At the time Chattanooga was key in the Southern railway system and was always humming with activity.

With his beverages in hand that was the beginning of what today is known as the Double Cola Company. That grape soda later became part of their Jumbo line of fruity sodas.

The company eventually became the Seminole Flavor Company in 1924. In 1933 they introduced Double Cola named so because of it being double the size of other cola products on the market.

In 1953 Seminole Flavor Company changed its name to be the Double Cola Company and today it celebrates its centennial as a beverage company.

But changes continued to roll from the 1950s until present day. The company changed ownership a few different times and new products continue to be introduced liked Ski their number one selling product a citrus soda made with real orange and lemon and a variety of other limited-time offers.

Today you’ll find their products in the South part of the Midwest and nationally in Cracker Barrel stores.

In 1991 Alnoor Dhanani moved to Chattanooga from London when his family purchased the Double Cola Company. He became CEO in 1997 and remains in charge today.

On October 10 2022 the Double Cola Company celebrated its remarkable 100th anniversary with activities across Chattanooga where Double Cola is still headquartered. A soda brand with a niche Southern and Midwest following may have wavered in ownership over the years but it always remained a part of Chattanooga. And in fact if it wasn’t for this city the beverage company may never have started.

""We have always felt that we have been blessed to be in Chattanooga and this town has been nice to us” says Dhanani.

Giving back is a huge part of what they do and the company has involved itself in many nonprofits in the community including the United Way American Cancer Society and more. Part of their centennial celebration culminated with a Habitat for Humanity build.

Each quarter an employee picks an organization meaningful to them and the company supports them through volunteering and other contributions. In fact they have become so ingrained in the fabric of the community that the City of Chattanooga declared the week of October 9 Double Cola week.

As for the future as beverage preferences continue to change the company hopes to be a part of the changing consumer beverages. The company recently added their first alcoholic beverages BrewSki a shandy made with beer and Ski soda and they plan to look at other opportunities in this space like canned cocktails.

“We’ll be looking more to the health-related beverages different products able to provide to the new consumer that they are looking for” says Dhanani mentioning things like water-related beverages and maybe even CBD or energy drinks.

One thing that won’t change: their dedication to Chattanooga and their loyal customer base.

“There is an amazing legacy of customers where we have known grandparents and their kids and grandkids who have supported us” says Dhanani. “And of course our love for the Chattanooga community.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvd2VybWFnLmNvbS9jaGluYS1icmVha3MtZ3JvdW5kLW9uLW1hc3NpdmUtMTYtZ3ctc29sYXItd2luZC1jb2FsLXByb2plY3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,China Breaks Ground on Massive 16-GW Solar Wind Coal Project,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiVmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnBvd2VybWFnLmNvbS9jaGluYS1icmVha3MtZ3JvdW5kLW9uLW1hc3NpdmUtMTYtZ3ctc29sYXItd2luZC1jb2FsLXByb2plY3Qv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E535B970>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

But that optimism is hard to find in downtown Guangzhou the commercial hub of southern China. Nearly three years of “zero Covid” measures have crushed businesses. Streets are lined with shuttered stores and workshops. Walls are plastered not with “help wanted” signs but with notices from entrepreneurs putting their businesses up for sale. Roads and alleys once packed with migrant workers are now mostly empty.

China’s reversal of its Covid restrictions in early December was meant to help places like Guangzhou. But the chaotic approach has contributed to a tsunami of infections that has swept across the nation overwhelming hospitals and funeral parlors. In many industries truck drivers and other workers have quickly fallen ill temporarily stretching staff and slowing operations.

Now faced with an unpredictable — and uncontrolled — epidemic and financial uncertainty people and companies are spending cautiously suggesting that the road to recovery will be uneven and painful."

A week after severe winter weather wreaked havoc on holiday air travel across the United States other major carriers were back up and running. Not Southwest.

The press has done a good job of reporting the impact on passengers but they have done a bad job on reporting why Southwest performed so badly.

The “point-to-point” model

Here is some coverage from the New York Times “Southwest uses a ‘point-to-point’ route model…” In the point-to-point model each flight is a single journey. The origin and destination are connected via a single non-stop flight. “Point-to-point flights cut travel times by eliminating the intermediate stop — typically a big advantage for travelers who are not flying from major metro areas. Other large carriers like United and American rely on a ‘hub-and-spoke’ model in which planes typically fly from smaller cities to a hub airport where passengers change planes.”

This is inaccurate. Southwest actually flies a point-to-point-to-point model. A plane starting in Richmond Virginia might fly to Chicago where most passengers get off. Then the plane flies to San Diego. Then it stays there overnight and the next day the plane might fly to Dallas.

And while Southwest says they are point-to-point Atlanta (ATL) Baltimore/Washington (BWI) Chicago Midway (MDW) Denver (DEN) Houston Hobby (HOU) Nashville (BNA) Oakland (OAK) Phoenix (PHX) and St. Louis (STL) are the airline’s major connecting airports. So many flights go in and out of these airports that flights going through these cities are really operating in a hub-and-spoke model they just don’t call it that.

Hub-and-spoke is more flexible

Several outlets reported that hub-and-spoke models are more flexible. Thus airlines operating in this model could recover more quickly. If “flexibility” is defined in terms of routing optionality this is true. The many potential different origin-destination pairings – along with a model that must consider how many can fly on a plane distance speed union rules federal regulations airline policies staff availability and other constraints as well – makes for a very very complex routing problem.

But the point of all those options is to maximize profitability not resilience. When it comes to resilience – recovering from something bad that happens – the simplicity of point-to-point beats hub-and-spoke or point-to point-to-point. If there is a plane flying between Richmond Virginia and Cincinnati Ohio – and something goes wrong – only the passengers on that route are affected. But with the other models bad things happening in one place can ripple through the system and lead to a cascading set of cancellations.

What did happen?

As soon as I heard how much worse Southwest was performing than their competitors I knew there had to be an IT problem. That proved to be true.

Southwest’s system it turns out could not keep track of where its crew members and pilots were after so many flights were canceled. That led to the snowball effect that crippled operations.

But it was more than that. Ground operations in Denver were hampered by an unusually high number of absences among ramp employees. Ramp employees help planes park and handle the luggage. If this part of the supply chain is not working the snowball starts rolling and the whole chain breaks down.

The Union is not willing to have their people blamed. The ground workers at Southwest Airlines are represented by Transport Workers Union (TWU). The Union issued a statement. “When Southwest’s model changed” (from point-to-point) “preparation needed to change. If airline managers had planned better the meltdown we’ve witnessed in recent days could have been lessened or averted.

“When you’re dealing with sub-zero temperatures driving winds and ice storms you can’t expect to schedule planes as if every day is a sunny day with moderate temperatures and a gentle breeze. The human factor also has to be a consideration. Ground workers need more support. Many of our people have been forced to work 16 or 18 hour days during this holiday season. Our members work hard they’re dedicated to their jobs but many are getting sick and some have experienced frostbite over the past week. In severe weather it’s unreasonable for workers to stay outside for extended periods. People need to be able to cycle in and out of the cold. The airline needs to do more to protect its ground crews.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZGh0dHBzOi8vdmlld2Zyb210aGV3aW5nLmNvbS9oZXJlcy10aGUtbG9uZy10ZXJtLWRhbWFnZS10by1zb3V0aHdlc3QtYWlybGluZXMtZnJvbS1ob2xpZGF5LW1lbHRkb3ducy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Here's The Long-Term Damage To Southwest Airlines From Holiday Meltdowns,"Southwest Airlines experienced an operational crisis greater than any in its history – and this is an airline that managed to operate a four aircraft schedule with just three planes and developed the 10 minute turn – in order to survive.

It didn’t just cancel flights broadly across its system for the holidays it kept doing it day after day unable to recover effectively. That ruined the holidays for more and more people compounding the issues – and hits to their business.

As they’re recovering we can now look at what the long-term damage here is? Reputationally I’d argue there’s very little. However there’s likely a bigger long-term impact to the airline’s finances.

Southwest’s reputation will recover with customers.



United recovered from David Dao . A passenger being dragged off of a plane and bloodied was a worldwide phenomenon and customers all over swore they’d never fly the airline again. That didn’t last.

. A passenger being dragged off of a plane and bloodied was a worldwide phenomenon and customers all over swore they’d never fly the airline again. That didn’t last. Spirit Airlines recovered from an operational meltdown at similar scale last summer.

The media stopped referring to AirTran as ‘formerly ValuJet’ after a couple of years and Southwest even acquired AirTran. That was a far worse disaster.

Customers either perceive airlines as being all the same or anchor their expectations. Southwest’s reputational hit will be temporary. Nonetheless there will be long term costs.

Their operational debacle exposed long-term underinvestment in technology which Southwest has been addressing very slowly. That will need to accelerate. That will mean a lot of capital spending and shifted focus away from growth opportunities. They simply don’t have the tools to properly track crew and rebuild flights after major disruptions and they won’t be able to defer those investments any longer.

A huge percentage of employees are new. The culture has taken a hit and fewer employees remember what things were like – this will have a bigger impact on how employees see their company than it will how customers see it. Southwest hired more than 15000 people in 2022. Nearly 20% of their workforce has been with he company less than a year. They don’t have a career in which to put this in context – being stranded themselves or having their friends stranded and feeling that their company has failed rather than being on board a winner will loom large.

There will be a big hit to revenue and one-time costs from this. But there will be longer-term cost to growth and higher costs and that could weigh on the stock and the business. They will see hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue loss from customers they weren’t able to fly and hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses to cover for passengers they stranded. But the higher capital spend will be even greater the re-prioritization will mean other lost opportunities as well.

Historically markets valued Southwest’s business differently than the rest of the industry. Some of what made them special may have already eroded but this incident accelerates those changes.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiZmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZWJhbHRpbW9yZWJhbm5lci5jb20vZWNvbm9teS9idXNpbmVzc2VzL3NvdXRod2VzdC1jcmlzaXMtYndpLVdTRFFSSUhDSkpGSkxESVQ2NFhJT1hISk5VL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Southwest has long been a traveler favorite in hubs like BWI but now faces a crisis,"The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors.

Anyone booking a flight from BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport these days will likely end up on Southwest Airlines the once-quirky low-cost carrier that elevated the regional airport to a major East Coast hub over the last three decades.

Most involved were probably fine with that. The Dallas-based airline has produced billions of dollars in economic benefits for Maryland major traffic for the airport and convenience and cost savings for area travelers.

Now that mutually beneficial relationship may feel different even among the devoted customers.

Analysts observers and lawmakers say the epic chaos over the Christmas holidays made the airline look less nimble and far less capable than other airlines. They said it may have been spurred by bad weather but was amplified by bad planning and response. The impact was felt disproportionately at airports such as BWI.

The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one.

“It’s every airport director’s dream to become a hub for a major airline and there is no question BWI has benefited from Southwest’s presence over the years” said Henry Harteveldt a travel industry analyst at Atmosphere Research Group.

“That said being a hub airport and having a single airline controlling so much of the flight capacity is a double-edged sword for any airport whether BWI or Atlanta or Dallas” he said. “The airport’s fortunes are so tied up with that airline.”

Long-term fallout remains to be seen he and others said. Southwest airline executives have apologized on social media and through media statements for stranding so many passengers and pledged short- and long-term improvements.

But the airline did further damage to itself when executives took too much time to take responsibility and put too much blame on the weather said Kathleen Day a lecturer at the Johns Hopkins Carey Business School with an interest in crisis communications and corporate responsibility.

Executives should have been early and effusive in their apologies and should have even been seen on the ground at a hub helping individuals.

“Where was the CEO the board anyone?” she said. “They were such an outlier; their phones didn’t even work. If they don’t follow through on improvements their customers are going to be wary.”

While flights returned to normal for most airlines by last Thursday Southwest still canceled 58% of its flights nationwide that day according to the tracking service FlightAware far more than any other airline. That heavily contributed to cancellation of 28% of flights originating from BWI the fourth-largest rate around the country.

There isn’t much BWI and other airports can do when airlines fail customers. And the continued dominance of Southwest now baked into BWI’s schedule isn’t likely in doubt Harteveldt says. Southwest has come back from other major disruptions from weather and has mostly come back from the coronavirus pandemic that temporarily restricted travel.

BWI spokesman Jonathan Dean said the airline is taking problems seriously and the relationship “remains strong.”

Some observers still expect changes even if they are small. Other airlines once hesitant to expand might add a few more flights Harteveldt said. If they go well they may add more.

The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one.

“That would be great for travelers in Baltimore” possibly adding new travel times and destinations and lower fares he said.

Harteveldt and others also say the mess could force other improvements. For example Harteveldt said Southwest does not have traditional agreements with other airlines to rebook travelers whose flights are canceled but could reconsider to ensure no one is stranded again. Fares which are not always the lowest anymore could drop some.

Dean reiterated the value that Southwest brings to Maryland and travelers but he said officials are investing in improvements at the airport to improve the experience for travelers. And they are working to boost the number of carriers and destinations. He said three new airlines launched service at BWI this year and several routes were added.

Del. Mark Chang an Anne Arundel Democrat whose district includes the airport said travelers may make other choices if they have them. The crisis should create a “teachable moment” for Southwest he said.

“I think that this is really a time where they can really learn from their losses from what happened and try to do a lot better in the future” Chang said.

Del. Kumar Barve chair of the General Assembly’s environment and transportation committee added that Southwest has managed to stay a traveler’s choice over the years by doing things like not charging for extras like baggage even when they were no longer offering the cheapest fares.

Others have been drawn to the airline’s chatty flight attendants lack of assigned seating and loyalty program.

Some will give the airline a chance said Barve whose own flight from Dallas was delayed by three or four hours last Tuesday.

“Those of us who are Southwest fans and I guess I am a bit of that I really like their business practices” he said. “I have to assume they’re going to get their act together.”

He and others said there will be a lot of people watching to make sure they do. No committee meetings or hearings about Southwest have been scheduled Barve said.

The Baltimore Banner thanks its sponsors. Become one.

Sen. Chris Van Hollen a Maryland Democrat noted that the U.S. The Department of Transportation is investigating what he called “a debacle of its own making.”

In a statement Van Hollen said in addition to holding management accountable and compensating passengers Southwest needs to “restore consumer and public trust and demonstrate to the Maryland Aviation Authority that it has a plan in place to prevent a repeat of this breakdown.”

There remains a lot riding on fixes. There are about three dozen airlines serving BWI but Southwest controls more than 70% of flights. Southwest had been dominant nearly since it entered the market but cemented the big lead in 2011 when it bought BWI’s number-two airline AirTran Airways.

Analysts say airports typically don’t want more than 50% of flights controlled by one airline.

The state bought the former Friendship International Airport in 1972 and renamed it Baltimore-Washington International Airport a year later in an attempt to lure more passengers from the city 30 miles to its south according to a timeline provided by BWI. State officials added Thurgood Marshall to the airport name in 2005 to honor the former U.S. Supreme Court justice who grew up in Baltimore.

In 1993 Southwest chose the underused airport wedged between the larger markets in Philadelphia and Washington as its East Coast gateway airport. It began basing pilots and flight attendants at BWI and the airline now employs 4600 in the region.

Southwest grew quickly at BWI by adding flights through its signature city-to-city system. This was different from the traditional hub-and-spoke system of major airlines that funnels passengers through a few airports. While the system may make it easier to add destinations in normal times it also may have contributed to issues during the storm because airlines and crews not moved ahead of time were scattered and stuck.

According to BWI traffic grew to 27.1 million passengers in 2019 before a pandemic-related drop. That was up from 12.8 million passengers in 1994.

Along the way state and federal officials aided the Southwest expansion. Maryland lawmakers for example approved $48 million for an expansion of the Southwest concourse that opened in 2021 and added five new gates.

Southwest had outgrown the state-of-the-art 510000-square-foot terminal built for it in 2005 that connected 15 existing gates and Concourse B with 11 new gates in Concourse A. The airline also added international flights in 2014 from BWI the first for the airline according to the BWI timeline.

For their part Southwest officials said in a statement that they were also eager to “return to a state of normalcy.”

But they also acknowledged that the normal may not be enough. In addition to setting up a page for customers to seek refunds and reimbursements for meals hotel and alternate transportation the airline said it would work to upgrade its systems.

In a statement to The Baltimore Banner Southwest officials added that modernizing operations was a priority in a five-year strategic plan from 2021 predating the latest troubles.

The airline plans to “get back to our historic operational reliability and efficiency” the statement said. And while efforts were underway “we need to finish that work.”

According to federal law airline passengers are entitled to a refund if a flight is canceled for any reason. But navigating the reimbursement process can get complicated when it comes to determining what other expenses qualify for a refund according to travelers who have had their vacations upended.

In order to request a refund the company says passengers whose flights were canceled from Dec. 24 to Jan. 2 should fill out a form and submit receipts online.

The form asks for a reservation number and name noting that passengers need to complete the form just once for all travelers in their reservation.

For additional expenses the company says it will “honor reasonable requests for reimbursement.” However it does not specify what that entails.

Southwest will refund tickets on canceled flights and executives repeated a promise to reimburse travelers who were forced to pay for hotel rooms meals and flights on other airlines. The airline’s chief commercial officer said that process will take several weeks. Executives said the airline also will pay to ship baggage that has piled up at airports around the country.

On its website Southwest told customers affected by canceled or delayed flights between Dec. 24 and Jan. 2 to submit receipts. The airline said “We will honor reasonable requests for reimbursement for meals hotel and alternate transportation.”

Southwest lost $75 million during a much smaller disruption in October 2021 that resulted in about 2000 canceled flights over a four-day stretch.

CEO Robert Jordan said it was too early to say how much the company will lose in revenue and incur in extra costs because of the current crisis. “This has been an incredible disruption and we can’t have this again” he said.

Robert Mann an aviation consultant and former airline executive said the Transportation Department could force Southwest to pay refunds for all flights that were canceled for reasons within the airline’s control such as lack of crews. He estimated that could total 6000 cancellations affecting 1 million customers and adding up to $300 million.

Fred Barber whose daughter’s and son-in-law’s flights were canceled Christmas Day said he plans to seek reimbursement for their rebooked next-day American Airline tickets which cost about $290 each. His family also plans to submit expenses they wouldn’t have incurred had their flight left as scheduled including some basic clothing items prescription medicine and gas mileage.

Barber who lives in Argyle drove back and forth to Dallas Love Field during the rebooking process approximately 40 miles each way. He estimates their request totals about $1000 and said he hopes to recover the full amount.

“I can’t think of anything we are asking for that is unreasonable” he said. “All of these are things that they should not have had to pay for.”

But Barber said he is privileged to absorb the extra costs in the meantime.

“From our family’s standpoint this is a first-world problem” he said.

Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said his department would hold Southwest accountable. “They need to make sure that those stranded passengers get to where they need to go and that they are provided adequate compensation” including for missed flights hotels and meals he said Wednesday on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”

David Gail whose flight also was canceled over the holiday said he hopes to get a full refund for his rebooked same-day flight on JSX for himself his wife and their three children.

Gail also submitted expenses for his rental car. His family had plans to rent a car but had to drive three hours to a different airport to catch a flight back to Dallas.

He said his reimbursement request totals around $2400 and considers those expenses to fall under Southwest’s definition of “reasonable.”

“It would have been much more expensive for Southwest had we booked two hotel rooms for three days and had a rental car for three days” he said.

Gail received an automated email from the airline Thursday that acknowledged receipt of the request and provided a case number. The email says the passenger will receive a “personalized response” from a member of Southwest’s customer service team but does not disclose exactly when the airline will process the request.

Meanwhile Imani Stewart said she received a full refund for her canceled Southwest flight from Dallas to Salt Lake City by talking to a ticketing agent at Love Field. The conversation took about an hour she said.

Stewart also asked the agent for a refund on the $95 pet fee she was charged for her small dog. The airline representative told her she wasn’t sure whether that qualified for reimbursement.

The Mansfield resident who flies Southwest in part because of how well they typically handle pets said she doesn’t see why this wouldn’t be considered reasonable.

“You’re buying your pet a seat or the ability for them to fly on the plane and he didn’t fly on the plane so the service at the end of the day wasn’t met” she said.

Stewart plans to submit her pet fee expense along with receipts for her rescheduled flights on United Airlines. She hopes to see some money refunded to her credit card by mid-January which she thinks is a “reasonable timeframe” for the airline to process her request.

Gone is the dated corridor although the part nearest to the terminus remains old-style with its marble flooring. The Gallery-Florence Underground welcomes an additional eight new stores to the already bustling Florentine shopping destination with a seven million euro investment by the local AD CASA group.

Among the new additions perhaps one of the most exciting is a Starbucks coffee shop. The Seattle-born cappuccino and coworking destination has long been considered a controversial addition to any Italian neighborhood. With the country’s caffeinated history it was unsure how an American coffee chain could stand the test of time next to beloved mom and pop shops. However in the spirit of modernization the bags of beans have landed and are now being brewed right here in the Tuscan capital.

Keicha Halsell — a k a Keke Not Palmer on TikTok — is blowing the plastic lid off the worst things customers can do when ordering a cup o’ joe at the Seattle-based coffee chain.

The barista revealed in a since-deleted viral video the most annoying “icks” that people give her when they buy coffee the Daily Mail reported.

The Florida native — who has nearly 20000 followers and more than 1 million likes on the platform — began her now-viral clip by declaring: “I’m pretty sure I can get in trouble for this video — but I’m gonna do it anyways.”

She went on to state her Top 5 grievances that irk her while she’s whipping up caffeinated drinks: Halsell’s first pet peeve is when people are on line and then they take “another whole five minutes to tell us what they want” when they get to the cashier.

Halsell — one of a growing number of alleged Starbucks workers attempting to shine a light on workplace grievances in viral videos — also despises those who order milk alternatives such as almond oat and soy products but then proceed to ask for sweet cream cold foam to top the iced drink with.

She noted that the ones who are unable to drink dairy shouldn’t be adding heavy milk and cream to their beverages as the additions won’t be beneficial to them.

The worker’s next issue is with customers who order new items they have never consumed before — and in turn wind up not liking the drink.

She then has to make a “cuppa five times” until the purchaser is satisfied. “How is that on me? [It] gets on my nerves” she groaned.

Her next irritation is when others demand a mystery drink that isn’t on the menu or is derived from TikTok thanks to the 32.1 billion videos labeled with the #Starbucks tag.

Halsell explained: “They don’t know the recipe so I have to sit there for two minutes and watch a barista on TikTok do a drink that took two minutes to make and then take two minutes to write it down and five minutes to make it.”

Her last annoyance is when she is brewing a latte — and then all of a sudden the person changes their mind and claims they “forgot to say ‘iced.’ ” She added that the patron should have said that little fact earlier when Halsell was typing in the order.

3 One of her main issues with customers is when they ask her to make a drink that’s not on the menu. TikTok / @kekenotpalmer

According to the Daily Mail report viewers of the since-deleted clip took to the comments and divulged that it’s workers like Halsell who make going to Starbucks an uneasy experience.

“This is why I have ordering anxiety. That’s why I’m staying home to make my own coffee” one user sniped while another chimed in: “This is why I just get my coffee at Speedway. Starbucks is just too much pressure.”

But there were a few fellow baristas thrown into the mix who came to Halsell’s defense with their own customer horror stories.

“My favorite was always ‘is this mine?’ ‘No ma’am. That hot coffee with the name Brian on it is in fact NOT your frap’ ” one supporter said.

Another commenter wrote: “I use to have a lady who would tell us we weren’t making her drink right so she could get a free drink coupon from whatever store manager was working.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhc3Rpbmd0YWJsZS5jb20vMTE1NDE5Ny90aGUtcmVhc29uLXN0YXJidWNrcy1vcmlnaW5hbC1waWtlLXBsYWNlLWxvY2F0aW9uLWRvZXNudC1zZXJ2ZS1mb29kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The Reason Starbucks' Original Pike Place Location Doesn't Serve Food,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRhc3Rpbmd0YWJsZS5jb20vMTE1NDE5Ny90aGUtcmVhc29uLXN0YXJidWNrcy1vcmlnaW5hbC1waWtlLXBsYWNlLWxvY2F0aW9uLWRvZXNudC1zZXJ2ZS1mb29kL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E4FEF220>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

However the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.

Starbucks hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies which have seen some growth on average. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially which has kept the P/E from collapsing. You'd really hope so otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.

How Is Starbucks' Growth Trending?

The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as Starbucks' is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.

If we review the last year of earnings dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 20%. As a result earnings from three years ago have also fallen 3.0% overall. Therefore it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.

Shifting to the future estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 19% per year over the next three years. Meanwhile the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.2% per annum which is noticeably less attractive.

With this information we can see why Starbucks is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.

The Bottom Line On Starbucks' P/E

We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.

We've established that Starbucks maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.

Before you take the next step you should know about the 5 warning signs for Starbucks (2 are a bit concerning!) that we have uncovered.

As it grew St. Luke’s executives described a master plan to curb the costs of health care — and to ensure that care actually makes people healthier.

One milestone in that plan arrived last fall: a new insurance company called St. Luke’s Health Plan.

“The thing that really is going to be different with our own health plan: you will have an integrated experience” said St. Luke’s Health Plan President Matt Wolff. “I think that’s a major hurdle that causes a lot of friction a lot of dissatisfaction. And frankly I don’t think it helps us grow trust in the community.”

The plan is similar in some ways to HMOs like Kaiser Permanente. People with the St. Luke’s insurance card will only be able to get health care services from facilities and health care providers that belong to the St. Luke’s network — which includes St. Luke’s and other independent providers. It differs from other HMOs too. For one thing patients won’t always need referrals from their primary care provider to see a specialist Wolff said.

He said St. Luke’s Health Plan promises to be more streamlined to keep patients from getting stuck in Kafka-esque red tape as they try to get healthy.

Patients won’t get caught between their health insurance company and their doctor when the two disagree he said.

The main way it does this Wolff said is to leave it up to medical providers to decide what is or isn’t medically necessary. That eliminates the need for “prior authorizations” — the process for insurance companies to approve or deny medical care before it happens.

But there’s an internal control on those decisions to control spending he said: the providers themselves are wholly responsible for the financial and health outcomes of their patients.

2023 will test St. Luke’s Health Plan concept

Ten years ago the St. Luke’s system brought another insurance company into Idaho with what it called “a unique strategic alliance.” It partnered with Select Health a Utah nonprofit insurer to launch a St. Luke’s-centric plan. That plan from Select Health was and continued to be popular with consumers.

The overarching idea of that plan was to reward St. Luke’s and its providers when they made smarter decisions. If they could keep patients healthy out of the hospital and off costly prescription drugs — thus controlling the costs for everyone — St. Luke’s and its providers could see monetary rewards.

Five years into that plan the Idaho Statesman reported that “St. Luke’s has yet to deliver on its promised savings in insurance premiums.”

Officials said in 2017 that it was “too soon to tell whether they can change how health care is paid for and meet their goals” but they believed they were on the right track the Statesman reported.

Wolff said the new health plan’s schematic is built on the lessons of that and other “value based” insurance arrangements — which in 2012 were a somewhat novel approach but are now very common in Idaho.

“Although people may talk about integration of having the providers making the decisions literally that is the case in our model. The St. Luke’s providers and (health care team) ultimately are the ones that are going to say whether these procedures these visits are necessary or not” Wolff said. “Providers and the care teams are 100% accountable for clinical and financial outcomes. It doesn’t mean that they’re necessarily going to have to do things that aren’t in line with the care that they think is best but it does (evaluate the health care) quality of the population the outcomes in the population together with a financial responsibility.”

St. Luke’s: Health plan not a prelude to shutting out competitors

St. Luke’s has faced criticism and even an antitrust lawsuit a decade ago over its growing share of the Treasure Valley health care market.

Wolff said St. Luke’s has no intention of becoming a closed-off system accessible only to those with a St. Luke’s insurance card. Among the insurers that competed with the St. Luke’s Health Plan on the exchange last fall nearly all of them had St. Luke’s health care providers and hospitals in their network.

“Our strategy will still be and always will be a multi-payer strategy because we don’t believe that one single payer or one single arrangement like that has enough momentum to really change the market” Wolff said.

What does it cost? That depends. Health insurance premiums under the St. Luke’s Health Plan vary depending on a person’s age where they live and whether they qualify for a subsidy based on their income. Each person’s out-of-pocket costs will depend on what kind of medical care they need and which plan they choose — with “bronze” “silver” and “gold” plans that represent a tradeoff between what you pay each month in premiums versus what you pay out of pocket to use the insurance. All of the St. Luke’s plans feature a $0 copay for some basics like primary care office visits on-demand virtual care outpatient mental health care and prenatal care. They can prevent more costly and complex health problems down the road Wolff said. Other health insurers in Idaho also offer no-copay health care services under the same philosophy. The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover some preventive care at no cost to patients. An estimated 862000 people in Idaho had $0 copay preventive care coverage through private insurance as of 2020 according to a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services report. Some of the St. Luke’s Health Plan benefits go beyond those basics. However the $0 copay doesn’t always mean a patient won’t have to pay a dime. For example there is a $0 copay for maternity care. But as the St. Luke’s Health Plan brochure explains that copay applies to the bill for the OBGYN or other maternity care provider. It doesn’t apply to a facility’s own charges for labor and delivery which in a hospital can run thousands of dollars or more.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWmh0dHBzOi8vc2NzdWh1c2tpZXMuY29tL25ld3MvMjAyMy8xLzIvc3QtY2xvdWQtc3RhdGUtc29mdGJhbGwtYW5ub3VuY2VzLTIwMjMtc2NoZWR1bGUuYXNweNIBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,St. Cloud State Softball Announces 2023 Schedule,It's a new year and that means it is time for a new season of St. Cloud State softball.

American-Statesman Correspondent

It seemed almost second nature for St. Michael’s players Hayes Pounds and Bo Ogden.

Pounds — a point guard with basketball smarts and decision-making most colleges wish for — and Ogden a freshman forward who may be on the cusp of dominating Central Texas hoops the next three years connected on a backdoor alley-oop where it’s debatable whether Pounds even looked at the basket.

The play in the William Roberts Memorial Tournament last week at Round Rock High School gave just a glimpse why St. Michael’s is not only the TAPPS power in Central Texas but also why it’s spent much of the season ranked No. 1 in the private school Class 5A rankings.

“What’s fun about this team is we have a lot of high basketball IQ guys” St. Michael’s coach Cooper Land said. “We have multiple guys who see the floor very well are very unselfish and they all enjoy spending time together. They eat lunch together they hang out together on the weekends and I think that shows in the way they play. They’re very unselfish and it’s fun to coach.”

Though their 14-7 record entering this week may not be eye-popping the Crusaders have played a rugged slate the last two months.

Scheduling can vary wildly for TAPPS schools but Land has chosen one loaded with some of the best local UIL Class 6A and 5A schools that is possibly the most difficult TAPPS nondistrict slate in the state. During a six-day stretch in November St. Michael’s beat Liberty Hill Vista Ridge and Rouse — all solid or very good programs — and also has a win over perennial 6A power Harker Heights.

The Crusaders played three teams in the American-Statesman’s Class 6A area poll — Stony Point Westlake and Round Rock — tough losing by a combined 20 points and taking the Dragons to overtime.

They also have narrow losses to Class 6A schools Cedar Ridge and Rockwall and played San Marcos — another team in the Statesman’s Class 6A poll — Tuesday.

“We definitely take a lot of pride in striving to be the best private school in Central Texas” Land said. “And the big reason that can happen is we have a bunch of guys who aren’t scared. We want to play the best teams as often as we can and really represent our school and community every time we step on the court and we have a lot of guys who have really embraced that.”

Things start and end for the Crusaders with Josh Jones. The 6-foot-10 senior post possesses a deft touch a skill that will have him playing Division I basketball for Oral Roberts next season.

Averaging nearly a double-double a game (20 points 9 rebounds) Jones who started as a freshman at Austin High before transferring is shooting better than 70% from the floor.

“Like any team for us it’s all about paint-touch” Land said. “We’re fortunate to have what I think is the best player in the city in Josh. We play through him and he’s really unselfish and a great passer and then we have a lot of guys around him who can make shots and are well-rounded players.”

Ogden the son of current Texas assistant and former Longhorns player Chris Ogden is already a dangerous scoring threat and once he physically matures will have college scouts drooling.

Having passed the 20-point mark several times in his first prep season — including against a good Weiss squad last week — Ogden is not only someone who can play above the rim but who can drive the lane make tough mid-range jump shots and shoot productively from behind the 3-point line.

But both Jones and Ogden benefit from Pounds — who starred at Wimberley last winter and was the Statesman’s all-Centex newcomer of the year — and his crafty and intelligent play. He also represents a tough third scoring option for opposing defenses.

Guards Jake Broxterman Zander Romero and Sugeeth Jinkal all give the Crusaders solid play and depth.

“We’re all smart play together well — and that’s something we use to beat good teams” Bo Ogden said. “We can really shoot it and are good at making the extra pass. Both on offense and defense we execute really well.”

Though St. Michael’s may be a bit of a scouting nightmare on offense Land said the focus for the Crusaders is always on defense.

“We try to establish a defensive identity every year — that’s what we spend the most time on” he said. “We want to pressure people but do it in a smart way in the right areas. We try to keep the ball on one side of the court as much as possible be in the right spots and try to contest everything whether it’s a pass drive or shot at the rim.”

St. Michael’s doesn’t focus on postseason goals Land noted but undoubtedly the Crusaders have thoughts of a state title in their heads. And with more tough games against New Braunfels and LBJ prior to starting district play on Jan. 13 St. Michael’s will be seasoned against rugged competition — something that it hopes will have it playing for the 5A championship on Feb. 25.

“Playing all these good teams makes you better” Bo Ogden said. “We’ll be well-prepared to play in the playoffs after this schedule. I hope we play this kind of schedule every year because when you face this level it really makes you better.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm53aXRpbWVzLmNvbS9kb250LWJ5cGFzcy1zdC1qb3NlcGgtZHVyaW5nLXRoZS13aW50ZXItc2Vhc29uL2FydGljbGVfYzc3ODVlYmEtZmMyMi01ZDAxLTk4MTMtZGY4Yzk2ZmYyZTI1Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Don't bypass St. Joseph during the winter season,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.nwitimes.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /dont-bypass-st-joseph-during-the-winter-season/article_c7785eba-fc22-5d01-9813-df8c96ff2e25.html (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E3B700D0>, 'Connection to www.nwitimes.com timed out.

GREEN BAY Wis. (WBAY) - Each change of the calendar is celebrated with the Baby New Year and local hospitals are celebrating their New Year’s babies.

Gabriela was the first baby born in 2023 at HSHS St. Vincent Hospital in Green Bay. She was born 56 minutes after midnight.

Aurora Health Care had two New Year’s babies that we’ve learned about so far. First came Emmett making his appearance at 7:33 in the morning at 8 pounds 10 ounces. His parents are Brianna and Ethan of Oshkosh and he’s the little brother to Elizabeth and Wynter.

Then came Kali May born at 3:31 in the afternoon at 7 pounds 6 ounces. Her parents are Shanna and Chris of Green Bay and she’ll grow up with 6 siblings.

Between Emmett and Kali Bay ThedaCare’s first baby of the new year arrived at 10:11 a.m. Stryker (pictured below) was born at ThedaCare Medical Center in Shawano to mom Courtney and dad Brian and he’ll grow up with 9 siblings.

Discount Tire purchased the site at a recent Arizona State Land Department public auction. Proceeds from the sale will be invested by the state in the Permanent Land Endowment Trust Fund to benefit K-12 education in Arizona.

“Our commitment is to create the best most positive experience for our People” said Michael Zuieback chairman at Discount Tire. “We are pleased to acquire this property in Phoenix and begin work on an innovative sustainable workspace that honors and strengthens the culture on which our company was founded. Together with the support of our partners at the City of Phoenix Arizona Commerce Authority and Governor Ducey’s office we are grateful for the opportunity to make more dreams come true.”

Plans for a more than 300000-square-foot office building and campus amenities are in the early stages. Development is expected to commence in phases with the construction of infrastructure improvements beginning within 12 months. The announcement represents one of the largest economic development deals of its kind in recent years in Phoenix. Discount Tire which has maintained its corporate headquarters in Arizonasince 1970 while expanding operations across the U.S. was applauded by Gov. Doug Ducey for the purchase.

“Discount Tire is one of Arizona’s greatest business success stories” said Governor Doug Ducey. “From Bruce Halle’s first stores in Phoenix more than 50 years ago to growing to be the nation’s premier tires and wheels retailer Discount Tire has always done business while giving so much back to Arizona and our communities. I’m grateful to Chairman Zuieback and the entire Discount Tire team for their continued dedication to our state and look forward to many more decades of their success.”

The future corporate campus will house Discount Tire’s headquarters and the offices of The Diane & Bruce Halle Foundation a leading provider of philanthropic resources to local communities across the state of Arizona.

“I could not be more excited that Discount Tire chose to maintain its local presence with this new headquarters in North Phoenix” said Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego. “The company’s decision to locate here means 1100 high-value jobs. Given Discount Tire’s long history of growing its own talent I suspect many a career will be launched at this new location. Plus with Discount Tire ranking as one of the largest private companies in the U.S. and bringing its award-winning pedigree for being customer-centric its presence further elevates Phoenix’s reputation for excellence.”

Discount Tire ranked as the No. 77 largest company on the “America’s Largest Private Companies” list in 2022 and has been named a top employer in Arizona multiple times.

“Discount Tire’s new headquarters in Phoenix marks an exciting new chapter for the company” said Sandra Watson president and CEO of the Arizona Commerce Authority. “With this innovative corporate campus Discount Tire joins Phoenix’s vibrant business community poised for continued growth.”

Special attention in the development will be paid to the native desert landscape indigenous vegetation and connectivity to nearby trails.

“We are incredibly excited about Discount Tire’s development plans in Phoenix and believe their commitment to Desert Ridge will further enhance new quality business development in the area. Our workforce and the surrounding community will continue to benefit from this partnership” said Councilman Jim Waring who represents this area of Phoenix.

The European Commission decided it’s time to allow passengers to use 5G in airplane mode during flights. This means Netflix and Spotify won’t be out of bounds anymore — and you can keep your family up to date with your ETA.

This decision creates a huge division between aviation in Europe and the rest of the world including the US. The latter is still dealing with repercussions after 5G transmitters halted or rerouted flights across the country making it unlikely to follow in the EU’s footsteps. This poses a question: why can one continent safely implement 5G phones on planes while the other is struggling with cellular receivers on the ground? And is the move as “safe” as we’re led to believe?

The Real Reason Behind the Airplane Phone Ban

Pilots rely on the plane’s automation systems especially in bad weather conditions as altitude readings let them know when to get ready for touchdown. Altitude radars called aviators use radio frequencies similar to those sent by cellular networks to get their readings. This could cause potential interference and false results (at least in theory) so airlines had to ban the use of phones on planes — unless they’re in airplane mode.

Considering how enforced the phone ban is on all airlines we still have very little proof to confirm whether phones actually interfere with aviators. Many aviation experts also argue you wouldn’t be allowed to take your mobile devices with you on board if they really posed a threat to the system. So it might be more of a precaution as people err on the side of caution.

However it turns out airlines may have another reason for banning phones. Imagine being stuck 10000ft in the air with 200 people loudly chatting on the phone at the same time. Even 30 minutes of it would put you at your wit’s end. So airlines avoid unnecessary arguments and complaints by making sure you don’t use your phone on a plane for anything other than your personal entertainment.

Use Mobile Data Safely

Picocells as the Onboard Network Connectors

In order to implement the new decision European airlines will equip their aircraft with picocells. These are essentially small cellular base stations which send and receive short-range low-power signals. Picocells connect to satellite networks or mobile network stations which then enables further communication on your phone allowing easy calls and data exchange.

Since picocells are small they aren’t prepared to handle too many users at the same time. At the moment guidelines show they can only provide mobile connections to about 100 passengers at a time. This means we’ll likely see new in-flight rules which control who can access 5G on airlines in Europe and for how long. It’s also very possible that connecting to a plane’s picocell won’t be free.

Are 5G Phones Safe to Use on Airplanes?

Your phone call is unlikely to bring a plane down

5G is the latest generation of wireless communication and it uses a different radio frequency than aviators. On land 5G sits on the 3.4-3.8GHz radio frequency band while plane technology relies on the 4.2-4.4GHz frequencies. However cellular picocells on planes will likely operate at much lower frequencies than standard radio waves. This means zero interference with altitude readings or other aviation systems.

That said since phones send the strongest signals when they’re attempting a connection aircraft will become a significant source of varying radio waves. We don’t know how it could affect the electronic equipment on planes simply because airlines have never had to deal with it.

Should you worry about it? Not really. Modern technology allowed airlines to equip their aircraft with top-tier protective shields which prevent unwarranted interference. You should also remember planes already have to deal with different radio frequencies when they’re near the ground — so they’re prepared to handle it.

What many people seem to not talk about though is the cybersecurity risks associated with being connected to the internet on a plane. The main concern here is the possible surveillance of companies supplying 5G on board. Since your data has to go through a transmitter your privacy may be compromised without you realizing.

If you think you’ll be one of the first to try 5G in airplane mode you should consider getting security software to protect your personal information. A VPN provides all-around security for mobile devices with top-grade encryption and leak protection. Get PIA to keep your data private on any device – it’s risk-free with our 30-day money-back guarantee.

Protect Your Online Data

Will the US Allow Phones on Airplanes?

5G transmitters might be a problem for airplanes in the US

The 5G situation is a bit trickier in the US. Verizon and AT&T have started their nationwide rollout of C-band 5G coverage throughout the whole country. The move was met with huge opposition from big airlines and aviation experts who called for creating 5G-free zones around airports.

Why is 5G a problem in America but not in Europe? The key is the radio frequencies both regions use. In the US the 5G range falls between 3.7GHz-4.2HGz which is higher than in European countries and overlaps with the frequencies aviation equipment use.

What makes the situation worse is the position in which 5G transmitters are installed in the US. They face more parallel to the ground sending radio waves on a level more likely to crash with signals sent from a plane’s altimeter.

Because of these issues Verizon and AT&T agreed to place the 5G transmitters at least two miles away from airports in the country. If they’re such an issue on the ground it’ll probably be a while until the US even considers enabling 5G airline transmitters — at least until they decide to lower 5G frequencies to a safer level.

It’s The End of Airplane Mode in the EU — What’s Next?

As a frequent traveler I’m both thrilled and weary of what the introduction of 5G phones on planes might mean. On one hand you’re no longer forced off the grid for hours on end. On the other you might have to endure loud conversations in addition to crying babies and tipsy passengers.

We’re yet to find out if introducing 5G in airplane mode will cause any safety issues. In theory it shouldn’t — but who knows what will happen in practice? It’s possible other regions like Australia or Canada might follow suit with similar decisions. However the US still needs to sort out its 5G issues on land before installing picocells on aircrafts.

If you’re planning to use mobile data on a plane anywhere in the EU you should consider protecting your traffic with a VPN. You never know who has surveillance over the internet in public spaces – airplanes included. Use PIA to encrypt your traffic and keep your data private. It’ll also stop any accidental leaks resulting from a picocell losing connection.

You’re not alone. This 2021 Game of the Year was a smashing success when it came out and has sold more than 7 million copies to date. Of course part of the appeal is the fact that you get to play the game with someone else.

Recommended Videos

If you’ve gone on this fun narrative adventure to rekindle a couple’s relationship then you know how absolutely engrossing the game happens to be. Unfortunately it’s fairly short and that’s left a lot of gamers wanting more. Fortunately there are a number of games out there with two-player co-op that can get you right back into that cooperative spirit.

Let’s go through eight of them.

Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons

I have some good news for It Takes Two lovers. The studio responsible for it made a few other games with Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons being the first. This game also follows the story of two people trying to solve a common goal but this time it’s two brothers who want to cure their dad’s illness.

They live in a world full of trolls and orcs and they need to work cooperatively to progress. It’s not quite multiplayer per se – you control one brother with the left stick of the controller and the other with the right. You need to guide both brothers past puzzles and obstacles and when one dies you go back to a checkpoint.

There’s also a multiplayer version of the game but that’s only on the Nintendo Switch. If you have one you’re in luck. Otherwise you can take turns with someone to try and figure things out. One of the brothers is stronger and can do things like pull levers and boost his smaller brother to high places.

The other brother can slip through tight spaces. Sometimes one brother has to distract a monster while the other one sneaks by. Regardless the meat of this game is the narrative. Like It Takes Two it’s an emotional story that unfolds with various surprises along the way. The dialogue is a fictional language based on Arabic so most of the story is told through gestures actions and expressions.

A Way Out

After the success of Brothers head developer Josef Fares created Hazelight Studios and partnered with Electronic Arts for his next game: A Way Out. Just like It Takes Two there’s no one-player option. It can be played either locally or online with a stranger or friend.

The game was specifically designed for split screen and sometimes one player will be playing while the other watches a cutscene. The game follows prisoners Leo and Vincent as they escape from prison and help each other avoid capture. You’ll perform tasks that are exciting and some that are a bit more mundane.

The story’s told in flashbacks with the two convicts on a plane. Once the story catches up we move forward from there into an amazing conclusion that will surprise you and I won’t spoil. It lasts about six hours and there are a lot of cutscenes to watch most of which are extremely well done.

The two convicts both have their own personalities – Leo being the more violent one and Vincent with more of a silver tongue which he uses to get out of predicaments. The game’s basically a collection of mini-games that let you drive shoot play darts arm wrestle punch sneak and choke out bad guys and it’s all a blast. At one point you’re even playing baseball.

The story is also incredible and there are times when the writing is so good you feel like you’re one of the characters. It’s a little short but definitely worth the journey.

Portal 2

You’ve played Portal right? Seriously if you haven’t stopped everything you’re doing and go play it right now. Thank me later. You’re back? Okay now go play Portal 2 and marvel at the fact that it’s somehow better. Phew. Now that you’re all caught up it’s time for great news: there’s a co-op-only mode in the game.

That’s right. There’s a whole self-contained story involving two new robots and it picks up right where the single-player game leaves off. It’s weirdly almost better than the story. Seriously it has no business being this good. Because there are two robots there are now four portals available and developer Valve takes full advantage of this.

The puzzles are more complicated and require more coordination than the single-player ones. You also can’t just sit around and let your partner handle everything – it becomes very clear very quickly how much cooperation is necessary.

One of the more cohesive additions is communication which is paramount when playing with strangers. Valve gives you the ability to set markers around the room to show your partner where to shoot a portal something that will be increasingly helpful in the more complicated later levels.

Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury

The original Super Mario 3D World came out in 2013 for the Nintendo Wii U a console that didn’t quite sell as much as its predecessor the Wii or its successor the Switch. It was a marvel of a game that allowed for four people to play at once.

Between both versions however more than 15 million units have been sold. Sure it’s Nintendo but you don’t move those kinds of numbers unless you have something really special and this is really special. You can play as Mario Luigi Toad or Princess in this 3D jump fest that takes old Mario tropes and puts them on their head.

The multiplayer is hectic and requires some communication but it’s also just fun to go for it and see what happens. Honestly it’s easier with two people than four but four needs to be experienced at least once in life. While not as freewheeling as say Super Mario Galaxy this one is still a blast.

Unravel 2

Another fun platformer that can be played alone but is more fun with someone else Unravel Two actually has a lot in common with It Takes Two in a lot of ways.

Your character Yarny can jump climb lasso and rappel all while trying to reach a level’s destination. What’s really fun is the addition of anchor points. Either character can act as an “anchor” to the other to allow for the crossing of gaps and other obstacles.

It’s fun to do alone and requires concentration but it gets hilarious with two people mostly because of the precise timing required to get things done correctly. You’re going to get frustrated at first but once you get the hang of it things get a lot more fun. There’s a lot of planning necessary but the satisfaction of getting it right makes it worth it.

Kirby and the Forgotten Land

Kirby’s been in his fair share of games over the years but the Forgotten Land takes everything and dumps it in the river (in a good way). It’s a brand new take on everyone’s favorite anthropomorphic pink circle and it comes with a wonderfully laid-back co-op mode that’ll keep you busy for hours.

The co-op is unlocked when Kirby finds Elfillin a little flying creature and Bandana Waddle Dee (the second player). Waddle Dee can’t suck up enemies but he can fight with a spear and use Kirby’s evolved abilities. One of the more annoying things about the co-op is when Kirby uses mouthful mode and turns into an object like a car or a safety cone and player two has to simply hang out while this is happening.

It doesn’t ruin the game at all but there are going to be some moments of downtime. The levels are huge and get more challenging as they go on so the addition of co-op is actually a huge help. It’s one of the better co-op experiences around.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge

For players of a certain age this is a fast-paced fun romp through childhood. Everything is here: the retro graphics the callbacks and those classic TMNT enemies. Also you can play as Splinter April O’Neil and Casey Jones. Be warned this is a beat-em-up game so those looking for an emotional nuanced experience aren’t going to find it here.

What you will find is heart-thumping arcade action that mimics the glory days of arcades back when people went to malls and rented movies from Blockbuster. This is a game that is fun playing solo but much much more fun when playing with friends.

There are sixteen bone-crunching levels to work through with nods to a number of TMNT games from the past. If you want simple mindless fun this is your game.

As Dusk Falls

This one plays almost more like a movie than a game but it has such a cool interactive component that it would be a shame to not put it on this list. Dusk Falls is an interactive drama that deals with family issues kind of like in It Takes Two.

It’s actually a masterwork in storytelling and will keep you engrossed despite the fact that you’re mainly just making choices. You can play it alone but you can also play it with up to 8 people making it a real party game. Dusk Falls is full of difficult votes and allowing other people to chime in on which one to choose really gives it a unique quality.

It’s also insanely replayable with chances of seeing everything the first time through being basically impossible. If you want something different then this one’s for you.

From the minor levels all the way up to the major series the amount of money needed to take a driver from just starting out to become a race winner and champion can rank in the tens of millions of dollars. Sometimes decisions about liquidity end up being the factor between picking a well-funded driver with more marginal talent over a top-flight racer with thinner pocketbooks.

But for years the primary way that the IndyCar community has offset some of the operating costs is of course sponsorships. Racing endorsement deals have been around since the very beginning with cars built by the then dozens of auto manufacturers being raced to see which car would stand up to the rigors of high-performance racing.

Ray Harroun was driving a Marmon Motor Car Company “Wasp” when he won the first Indianapolis 500 in 1911. From there among the earliest Indianapolis 500 winning cars are a Who's Who of early auto (and some still around) manufacturers: Peugeot Duesenberg Mercedes Delage and National Motor Vehicle Corporation (Fun fact the 1912 500 was won by Joe Dawson in a National Model 40 the only time a stock car ever won the race).

Auto parts and lubricant manufacturers were not far behind. More early Indianapolis 500 race winners included cars sponsored by Noc-Out Hose Clamps Blue Crown Spark Plug and of course Bowes Seal Fast. Later Pennzoil Texaco and Valvoline would shine on race-winning and championship-winning Indy cars.

As racing gained popularity in America during the 1950s and 1960s more consumer brands started to appear in IndyCar. Sheraton Hotels would famously sponsor A.J. Foyt’s 1964 Indianapolis 500 entry - the last front-engined car to win the race. Johnny Lightning toys would sponsor the back-to-back wins of Al Unser in 1970 and 1971. Tobacco brands like Kool Viceroy Skoal and Player’s alcohol brands like Miller Coors Light and Molson and fast food brands like Hardee’s and Pizza Hut became iconic and sharing their names evoke images of memorable cars and drivers from during the sport’s peak in the 1980s and 1990s.

But after the CART/Indy Racing League split in 1996 and the ultimate decline in television ratings that came from split audiences between the IRL and CART sponsorship became tougher to come by. Driven primarily by less-than-stellar television audiences sponsorship dollars started to quickly dry up in the IndyCar series. This left many long-time sponsors with tough decisions and many chose to move their money toward NASCAR or out of racing altogether in favor of other forms of marketing.

The perfect storm came with the signing of the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) in 1998 which severely limited tobacco advertising in motorsports after nearly 50 years. It couldn’t have come at a worse time and tens of millions of dollars in funding disappeared nearly overnight.

Today we take a look back at four sponsors whose logos were once an iconic part of IndyCar history but due to various circumstances no longer appear frequently (if at all) on the IndyCar circuit.

**********

MARLBORO

In 1970 President Richard Nixon banned tobacco advertising on television and radio in the United States. Starting in early 1971 when the ban took effect tobacco companies had far fewer mechanisms to reach potential consumers and they started to turn to motorsports as a way to find audiences.

In 1971 Marlboro briefly sponsored the USAC Championship trail only to leave the sport when competing sponsorship from Viceroy cigarettes backers of the new Vel’s-Parnelli Jones super team threatened the exclusivity rights the entitlement sponsorship would bring. USAC chose to allow more sponsorship competition over granting an exclusive license and after a single year Marlboro was gone. In 1972 Marlboro started its long relationship with Formula 1 teams and drivers by picking up primary sponsorship of the BRM team and later moving to McLaren for a lucrative and successful partnership that would run through the middle 1990s.

Marlboro didn’t return to IndyCar in a big way until 1986 when it partnered with Patrick Racing to join former two-time Formula 1 World Champion Emerson Fittipaldi who had been long associated with Marlboro from his Formula 1 days with McLaren.

In 1989 Marlboro sponsored both Patrick Racing and Team Penske. In an agreement for sharing Marlboro sponsorship and in preparation for Patrick’s eventual retirement Penske supplied Patrick Racing with customer cars one of which went on to win the 1989 Indianapolis 500 win with Fittipaldi behind the wheel. This agreement left the odd (at least for IndyCar then) situation where one sponsor appeared as a primary sponsor with two different teams.

By 1990 Fittipaldi left Patrick to join Penske partnering with Rick Mears and Danny Sullivan and Marlboro Team Penske was born.

From 1990-2010 Marlboro adorned cars at Team Penske would win 3 Indianapolis 500s (1991 1993 and 1994) and dominated the 1994 IndyCar season with 12 of 16 race wins and a 1-2-3 sweep of the IndyCar championship.

The final death knell for racing sponsorships for tobacco companies came with the multi-billion dollar Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) between big tobacco and state attorneys general in 1995 after which tobacco sponsorship was banned completely.

The Marlboro name disappeared from Team Penske’s cars as they transitioned from CART (which was allowed at the time to carry Marlboro branding as Marlboro’s one “chosen racing series” to the Indy Racing League (though the livery featured the Marlboro colors for years afterwards). The final agreement between Marlboro’s then-parent Philip Morris and Team Penske ended for good in 2010 culminating a 21-year relationship.

TARGET

Ironically enough the Target sponsorship in IndyCar story starts right where the Marlboro one ends. Driven to purchase an interest in Patrick Racing in 1988 and after a year of mentorship under Pat Patrick Chip Ganassi took over the team for good in 1990.

Ganassi’s bespoke team started humbly with one car driven by Eddie Cheever with Target sponsorship on the side but would go on to be one of the most successful and long-lasting motorsports sponsorships ever.

The Target-adorned team would win 4 Indianapolis 500 races and an astounding 11 series championships with a Who’s Who of driving talent including Alex Zanardi Juan Pablo Montoya Jimmy Vasser Bryan Herta Scott Dixon and Dario Franchitti.

Juan Pablo Montoya would start the 2000 Indianapolis 500 in the middle of the front row in the famous Target lightning bolt livery. He would go on to dominate the race and win his first Indianapolis 500. Photo Courtesy: Indianapolis Motor Speedway



The zenith of the relationship featured the iconic anniversary livery with No. 50 in honor of Target’s 50th anniversary that won the 2012 Indianapolis 500 with Franchitti at the wheel.

Dario Franchitti took home his third Indy 500 win in 2012 behind the wheel of the renumbered for Target’s 50th anniversary Target Chip Ganassi Racing Honda.



The bulls-eye and lightning bolt-laden cars finally disappeared at the end of the 2016 season with Target changing its marketing direction and saying goodbye after 27 years with Ganassi Racing. To this day you could be easily forgiven for saying Target Chip Ganassi Racing when you talk about the team as the sponsorship spanned an entire generation of racing fans.

BUDWEISER

The all-red Budweiser livery became a staple of IndyCar culture throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Its most familiar run in IndyCar started with Mario Andretti and Newman-Haas Racing in 1984 then became even more recognizable with Bobby Rahal Scott Pruett and the Truesports Racing team which was a frequent visitor to victory circle.

Budweiser's most notable triumphs included the 1986 Indianapolis 500 18 other IndyCar wins and back-to-back driver championships with Rahal in 1986 and 1987. Sadly Truesports closed up shop for good at the end of the 1992 season with Rahal leaving to start Rahal-Hogan Racing (eventually morphing into today’s Rahal-Letterman Lanigan Racing) with some of the assets.

After the dissolution of Truesports Budweiser switched from Truesports to Kenny Bernstein’s King Racing which featured teams in NHRA Drag Racing NASCAR and IndyCar. In 1993. Budweiser would appear on cars furnished for Al Unser Roberto Guerrero Scott Goodyear and Eddie Cheever. In 1994 after years of disappointing results with only Scott Goodyear’s Michigan 500 win to show for its efforts King Racing folded the IndyCar team and the NASCAR team the following year.

From there Budweiser carried its sponsorship to Newman-Haas Racing running with Paul Tracy for his one season with the team in 1995 Christian Fittipaldi in 1996 and 1997 and then largely disappeared from IndyCar in 1998 deciding to focus on NASCAR going forward.

Budweiser has made one-off sponsorship appearances in IndyCar since then including associate sponsorship of Juan Pablo Montoya’s 2000 Indianapolis 500 winning car and a noteworthy family reunion with Graham Rahal in 2012 and 2016. The all-red Budweiser livery was also run in tribute by the younger Rahal during the 2021 season.

DOMINO'S PIZZA

One of the most memorable liveries in IndyCar history the No. 30 Domino’s Pizza “Hot One” first appeared in IndyCar with Doug Shierson Racing featuring driver Howdy Holmes in 1982.

After two seasons Holmes moved on and was replaced by Al Unser Jr who would bring the team its initial success.

But the team would best be known for Arie Luyendyk’s surprise 1990 Indianapolis 500 win. The deal issued a temporary stay of execution on Domino’s sponsorship. A poll taken just before the race showed the majority of Domino’s franchisees did not want to continue in racing.

By the end of the season the writing was on the wall. Shierson sold 50 percent of the team to Bob Tezak creator of the UNO Card game in late 1990 and Domino’s Pizza owner Tom Monaghan confirmed that Domino’s would leave at the end of the 1990 season.

Why the exit? It may have been the fact that Domino’s started facing legal issues stemming from its “30 Minutes or Less or It’s Free” delivery policy which was causing accidents across America. The visuals of race cars going more than 200 mph evoking this combined with the cost of fighting the litigation likely factored into the decision.

Tezak then merged the team with Vince Granatelli son of iconic car owner Andy Granatelli to create UNO-Granatelli Racing. Tezak later pulled out after not paying the bills and Granatelli ran the team pretty much out of his own pocket.

His battle with Total Petroleum to keep their logos off the car stemmed from a sponsorship deal they made with Tezak before he sold the team of which presumably Granatelli and Luyendyk saw little of the proceeds from. Within all of this drama Luyendyk managed to eke out two victories during the year on a car that was largely blank.

The Indianapolis 500 was a rare race where the UNO-Granatelli Racing team had a sponsor logo on the car. They also ran the #1 (interesting story about that here). Photo Courtesy: Indianapolis Motor Speedway



Overall the sponsor drama ended up being too much for everyone and the team folded at the end of the 1991 season.

The 800 MW represents a 3-time increase from its existing capacity of 300.7 MW. Mr. Somprasong also outlined PRIME’s 5-year target to increase its installed electricity production capacity to 1800 MW by 2027. The plan includes the development of solar and other types of renewable energy power plants in Asia.

Mr. Somprasong Panjalak added that PRIME recently launched new business lines including Energy and Environment Tech Solutions which specializes in designing installing and providing consultancy in innovation such as IoT Technology for Building Energy Management. Earlier in the year PRIME formed a joint venture with the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand (IEAT) to address Thailand’s Net Zero greenhouse gas emission. The collaboration will allow the JV to tap into 60 industrial estates comprising more than 4000 factories across Thailand. In the area of sustainability PRIME plans to be listed in the Stock Exchange of Thailand’s (SET) Thailand Sustainability Investment (THIS) index in 2023. The SET defines sustainable companies as companies that embrace sustainable business operations with a focus on responsibility for environmental social and governance aspects. The selected companies must pass the sustainability assessment questionnaire.

During the SET Opportunity Day session Mr. Piroon Shinawatra reported that PRIME’s total revenue and net profit for the nine months ending 30 September 2022 were THB 648 mn and THB 110 mn respectively. Core revenue (electricity sales) increased 6.6% year-on-year for the first nine months attributed to the completion of solar energy projects in Taiwan and Thailand. However total revenue declined THB 57 million or 8.1% year-on-year due to lower contributions from other business segments as the Covid pandemic disrupted supply chains and a lower share of profits due to the disposal of an investment in Japan in the third quarter of 2021.

PRIME’s solar farm project located in the National Park of Cambodia supported by the Asia Development Bank (ADB) will complete in December 2022. The project has a contracted and installed capacity of 60 MW and 77 MW respectively and will increase PRIME’s electricity production capacity by approximately 40% from 2023 and revenue is estimated at USD 6.0 million per year.

Related The vibes are off at Tesla

Analysts were hoping for a robust 1.8 million vehicles delivered for the year but Tesla needed to deliver just 1.4 million in 2022 in order to meet its goal of 50 percent growth for the year. And despite just missing that goal it was another record quarter of deliveries for the EV maker which has been dealing with a number of challenges this year many of which have nothing to do with Elon Musk buying Twitter.

“We continued to transition towards a more even regional mix of vehicle builds which again led to a further increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter” the company said in a statement. “Thank you to all of our customers employees suppliers shareholders and supporters who helped us achieve a great 2022 in light of significant COVID and supply chain related challenges throughout the year.”

It was a year of unique struggles for Tesla which included flagging demand an aging lineup and increased competition from legacy automakers. Musk’s purchase of Twitter led to a subsequent sharp decline in Tesla’s stock price which plunged by as much as 65 percent over the course of the year. The rout shaved billions from Musk’s own net worth leading him to claim the unfortunate designation as the first person to lose $200 billion according to Bloomberg.

The tiny semiconductor has played a huge role in the development of modern technology since its invention in the 1950s by an engineer at Texas Instruments. Chips power everything from personal computers to cellphones and fighter jets and sit at the frontline in a growing battle between the U.S. and China.

Mr. Miller an associate professor of international history at Tufts University writes that governments are in a race to control the next wave of development. American officials industry leaders and academics worry that the U.S. lags China and is vulnerable to Beijing’s growing threats toward Taiwan home to the world’s biggest chip-maker TSMC. The Biden administration has introduced sweeping bans on Chinese access to high-end technologies that it doesn’t produce itself and sought to boost domestic manufacturing with $52 billion in subsidies and tax credits for global manufacturers that set up operations in the U.S.

Mr. Miller’s timely book effectively explains the growing battle over a crucial industry including accounts of the scientists who created the semiconductor the process of offshoring manufacturing to Asia from the U.S. the rise of China and more recent American-led efforts to wrest back control.

While stock splits don't make stocks fundamentally cheaper their lower trading prices often attract a lot of attention from smaller retail investors who weren't previously willing to pay hundreds or thousands of dollars for a single share.

One stock that might be ripe for a split in 2023 is ASML (NASDAQ: ASML) the Dutch semiconductor equipment maker that trades at around $550 per share. ASML has already split its stock four times including 2-for-1 splits in 1997 and 1998 a 3-for-1 split in 2000 and an 8-for-9 reverse split (which was used to optimize its capital structure) in 2007.

What does ASML do?

ASML is the world's largest manufacturer of photolithography systems which are used to etch circuit patterns on silicon wafers. It's also the only producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems which are required to manufacture the world's smallest and densest chips.

A single EUV system costs up to $200 million and requires multiple planes to ship. Its largest customer TSMC can't produce its most advanced chips without ASML's EUV machines. Its other major EUV customers include TSMC's rivals Samsung and Intel.

ASML also supplies older deep ultraviolet (DUV) lithography systems to other chipmakers like Texas Instruments. Its smaller competitors in that market include Canon and Nikon.

How fast has ASML been growing?

ASML's dominance of the photolithography market makes it a linchpin of the global semiconductor market. That's why its annual revenue increased at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22% between 2016 and 2021 while its annual gross margin expanded from 44.8% to 52.7%.

ASML maintained that impressive growth trajectory even as it withstood a chip glut in 2019 (caused by the slowdown of the smartphone and PC markets) and disruptions from the trade war and the pandemic in 2020. That resilience suggests the company will easily bounce back from the current cyclical downturn in chip sales which was triggered by slower sales of PCs in a post-pandemic market and macroeconomic headwinds for the enterprise sector.

During ASML's latest investor day presentation last November it predicted it could generate 30 billion to 40 billion euros ($42.9 billion) in revenue in 2025 with a gross margin of 54%-56%. By 2030 it expects to generate 44 billion to 60 billion euros ($64.4 billion) in revenue with a gross margin of 56%-60%.

The midpoint of that forecast implies ASML can grow its annual revenue at a CAGR of 12% from 2021 to 2030. The top end of that guidance also means ASML's revenue will nearly triple from its 2022 estimate of 21.2 billion euros ($22.7 billion).

But will a stock split change anything?

If ASML does a 10-for-1 stock split and reduces its price from about $550 to $55 it won't change anything about the company. It's simply letting you buy a single slice of the same pizza instead of the whole pie.

Many brokerages also provide fractional trades now which make stock splits even less relevant for smaller retail investors. Nevertheless a split might still generate some fresh media buzz and capture the attention of new investors.

The main impact of a stock split will likely be felt in the options market where a single contract is tethered to 100 shares. Right now a single options contract for ASML is still pinned to $55000 in underlying shares. A 10-for-1 stock split would lower that threshold to $5500 and encourage more options trading among smaller investors.

Heavier options trading along with a lower stock price could make ASML a more actively traded stock. That increased liquidity could bring in more active traders but it shouldn't affect long-term investors who care more about ASML's role in the secular expansion of the semiconductor market instead of its near-term price swings.

Will ASML split its stock in 2023?

I don't think a stock split will be a top priority for ASML this year. Retail investors aren't enthusiastic about semiconductor stocks right now and splitting its shares would arguably seem like a desperate cry for attention.

Investors shouldn't care if ASML splits its stock or not. Instead they should appreciate ASML's monopolization of a crucial semiconductor technology its unmatched pricing power and its long-term growth potential. I believe those strengths make it one of the best semiconductor stocks to hold over the next decade.

Kyiv’s impressive battlefield successes imposed major losses on Russia in terms of territory manpower and materiel. The tide has turned in a brutal war of attrition. Russia’s gains are being reversed ever so slowly and at significant cost to all sides. But Ukraine has not won yet and it still has far to go in terms of regaining control of its territory as winter approaches. There are a variety of scenarios about when and how the war ends. Overall based on the counter-offensives this past fall one should be more optimistic than some senior U.S. military officials are about Ukraine’s prospects for greater success early next year.

Even though the war will continue into next year and perhaps beyond it is time to begin assessing longer-term implications for modern warfare especially in Europe. It is not too early in this age to draw inferences about how the character of warfare is changing. How can NATO and the United States adapt to best ensure Europe’s stability and advance U.S. interests?

There are two major issues in answering this question. The first is the ongoing debate about how shifts in military technology impact the balance between offense and defense. This debate has obvious implications for force structures across the West that should inform NATO’s security posture and investments. The second issue involves the overall balance of power in Europe and how NATO and the United States should be postured to best preserve stability. The implications of these shifts argue against increases in heavy tanks for the U.S. force structure and favor a posture along NATO’s frontier that is defensively oriented. This “hedgehog” approach is part of NATO’s past. An offensive posture that fails to take into account the changing character of warfare is counterproductive to regional stability and U.S. strategic priorities which are increasingly at risk in Asia.

Defensive “Dominance”

A number of military scholars such as my late friend David Johnson have written about how emerging technologies have made the defense dominant and complicated offensive maneuver. The strategic importance of this issue should be underscored and it should influence defense strategy and budgetary allocations beyond Europe. As T. X. Hammes put it:

Investing in the wrong side of the competition is a rich nation’s game that the United States may no longer be able to afford. Against peer competition at scale misguided investment could lead to strategic defeat.

This question should guide force development and overseas posture as part of the national security discussion.

What does it mean when it is claimed that some new technology produces an offensive or defensive advantage to a degree of dominance? Some clarification will help readers not familiar with this longstanding theory and its critics. The more common term in literature is the offense-defense balance which relates to military technology favoring one mode over the other. If the balance favors the defense because of some technological development like the rifled musket or machine gun then it is considered easier to be successful on the defense and thus wars are less likely. By contrast if the offense is dominant as the late Robert Jervis put it “it is easier to destroy the other’s army and take its territory than it is to defend one’s own.”

What is the utility of thinking in terms of offensive and defensive advantages in the state of military technology? Some scholars argue there is limited utility in categorizing weapons as offensive or defensive. Some weapons such as the tank can abet either an offensive campaign or a defensive mode of operations. One can easily imagine swarming drones as either offensive systems destroying an integrated air defense system or as a lethal defense against an armored force bearing down on friendly forces as seen in Ukraine.

Second “dominance” may be the wrong term to capture the ever-evolving shifts in the character of warfare or the perpetual interaction of tactics technology and human creativity that occurs in war. It may be better to conceive of offensive and defensive superiority along a continuum and think in terms of how changes in military technology produce shifts in the balance. Conceivably there are technological innovations (e.g. armed drones) that can achieve a truly dominating position in either offensive or defensive operations. Dominance would constitute the extremes of the continuum and arguably there are few such occurrences. Nuclear weapons would be the most notable example of offensive dominance given the state of ballistic missile defense.

Third it is not clear how emerging technologies impact each domain and whether policy makers and force planners we can generalize the current state of military technology across all domains as “defense dominant.” In space offense seems dominant since satellites are fragile and easily tracked. Both China and Russia are focusing on counterspace capabilities that reflect that trend. Some cyber strategists challenge the idea of defensive dominance in the cyber realm entirely. Other technologies including artificial intelligence may generate decisive advantages in that domain but it is not clear that they would only benefit defensive operations.

Finally it should be noted that military technology is applied in a particular context. Black and white distinctions may be counterproductive. Surely the ubiquity and relative low cost of surveillance and targeting technologies is going to favor fires and attrition over maneuver for the foreseeable future. This would support the defensive dominance line of thinking. But the ongoing maneuver-attrition debate should not be a binary choice. Both offense and defense require combinations of firepower and movement.

In short technology is changing the character of conflict and at present gives an edge in many situations to the defense. At this time a shift in favor of the defender is evident in ground warfare just as it was in the days of Helmuth von Moltke the Elder when the firepower revolution of the late 19th century made massed formations and maneuver prohibitively difficult. The underlying technologies of the current revolution will have the same impact and are offered not just by the United States but also by smaller powers like Turkey and Israel. However prudent planners realize that countermeasures will inevitably arise. A continuous cycle of action and reaction will alter the offense-defense balance over time in each domain.

Europe’s Balance of Power

The second issue that requires reflection is the balance of power in Europe vis-à-vis Russia and NATO’s capacity for collective defense. While it would be a mistake to ignore Russia’s reckless leadership and its ingrained sense of grievance overestimating its combat power and ability to reconstitute itself is not appropriate either.

In economic terms the European Union’s gross domestic product is 10 times that of Russia. That gap is only going to grow larger. The Russian economy is on the brink of ruin as it struggles to sustain its war effort and its recovery could last a decade or beyond. Demographically Europe’s population is over three times the size of Russia’s. Moscow’s human capital is in decline qualitatively but not quantitatively and the prospects for restoration are diminished by the war. Assessments of Russia’s demographic decline focus too much on population size and avoid critical questions about the quality of human capital (e.g. health care education etc.).

Moscow’s limitations include available resources for defense. No matter how you measure it NATO outspends Russia on defense. Moscow does well with converting its resources into effective weapons. Yet the Russian military is not designed for sustained offensive operations or the grinding war of attrition that it has now been employed in. The U.S. government concludes that Moscow has absorbed grievous losses with as many as 100000 Russian troops killed or wounded in Ukraine. Independent sources document Russian losses of 1420 tanks 2314 armored and infantry fighting vehicles and 262 aircraft. This has forced Russia to issue dated legacy weapons and conduct a “stealth mobilization” to offset its casualties. Sources from Europe assess that Russia has expended 80 percent of its missile inventory and is improvising by applying aged nuclear missile components to offset its depleted stock of weapons.

Regenerating new forces and combat power is going to be an uphill climb for Moscow. Russia has been reduced to using 30-year-old chips from Texas Instruments to sustain its operations. Any country forced to steal computer chips from refrigerators and dishwashers is both adaptive and desperate. The economic sanctions applied against Moscow will further degrade its industry and military-related production. Sanctions are not magic weapons but they clearly delay and depress a Russian reconstitution and impose higher costs. Still Moscow will seek workarounds. It is already looking to Iran for missiles and drones and to North Korea for ammunition. It is unclear if China will come to Russia’s aid in terms of military supply.

The combination of an improved position of relative combat power vis-à-vis Russia and Moscow’s limited ability to reconstitute its forces suggests that NATO will remain in a strong position in the short to medium term. Adding to the ledger are the contributions that Sweden and Finland bring to enhance NATO’s capacity and bolster deterrence and European stability. As NATO consolidates the accession of Finland and Sweden into the alliance and if Germany the “sleeping giant” can ever achieve its promised security transformation the alliance will hold a favorable balance of power. Germany remains a big “if” in my mind.

Assessment

Overall the threat from Russia is manifestly less challenging today than perceived. The conclusion that “the threat from Russia has returned to Cold War levels” does not stand up. In terms of its overall military power Russia is a shadow of the 1970s Soviet threat and has been significantly degraded in the last nine months. As Jack Watling has observed Russia’s poor performance and manifest shortfalls in Ukraine are notable and extend well beyond just materiel shortages. Russia does maintain a large force and has selected military capabilities (i.e. integrated air defense and long-range strike) that cannot be ignored but its combat power is much diminished for the foreseeable future. Russian efforts to restore its military muscle are not “doomed to failure” but it will be an uphill slog.

This argues against substantial increases in U.S. force presence on the continent. The current policy of temporary and modest increases in U.S. presence will do much to signal American commitment for the alliance from the Biden administration. Given the doubt that many Europeans have about American staying power after the Trump-era bashing of NATO it is a prudent adjustment as a temporary measure. But research surveys suggest that it may also result in Europeans continuing to free ride or to feel more vulnerable due to the presence of robust U.S. force levels. Moreover resources are limited and there are other critical gaps of higher priority to fund. The opportunity costs of further increasing force levels at the expense of other missions in Asia should be considered. All of this augurs against calls for significant increases in permanent U.S. armor formations on NATO’s frontier.

At the same time Western observers should avoid hubristic assessments about Russia’s powers of reconstitution. While Moscow may no longer be a full-spectrum superpower it retains geopolitical tools and a willingness to take risks. As a report from the Center for a New American Security shows Russia retains a sizable but not agile industrial base for reconstituting its military power. That said it will face challenges in acquiring modern technology from the West except through indirect means like from Iran to help build drones.

Russia will remain dangerous even in decline during the next decade and retain many tools to frustrate European stability. It is down but not out of business as a challenge to the West.

All told the West holds many systemic advantages over Russia: demographics education military staff expertise in complex operations advanced military technology access to capital and a relative lack of corruption. Russia’s economic potential is severely constrained but it has not (sorry for the pun) tanked yet. Given the stark scale of its losses and evident internal decay whatever resources Russia will have to invest will be needed to repair its present inventory restock a depleted supply of munitions and recruit tomorrow’s armed forces. Russia’s defense industry will be severely hampered by sanctions and lost fiscal and intellectual capital for some time. Its ambitious plans for fifth-generation fighters and peer-level combat aviation procurement are predicted to be deferred until it regains its missile production capacity and inventory which is not likely to occur in this decade. Nor will Beijing offset Moscow’s manifest deficiencies in operational planning manpower and personnel development. As suggested by ten authors writing for the NATO Defense College there are no scenarios in the offing in which the Russian economy is not heavily and negatively impacted by the war against Ukraine regardless of its outcome.

While arguing for a strengthened NATO defense posture Michael O’Hanlon has come to the same conclusion:

The 2022 Ukraine conflict has underscored the limitations of Russian military power and in fact it has dramatically weakened the Russian armed forces. With sanctions and export controls likely to remain in place for some time to come that reality is likely to persist.

As Stephen Kotkin has noted Russia’s aspirations vis-à-vis the West routinely outrun its capabilities. This cycle of “weakness and grandeur” is playing out again. Reconstituting its forces back to their 2020 level is going to take up much of the Russian Ministry of Defense’s attention and budget over the rest of this decade even though President Vladimir Putin has promised that there will be “no limitations” on military spending. Bringing its forces up to NATO’s level in qualitative terms may be near impossible when non-materiel elements are factored in. It is Russian weakness juxtaposed against Putin’s recklessness with the military power he has that makes Russia dangerous. While wounded Russia will remain a persistent problem.

This conclusion needs to be factored into adaptations for U.S. overseas base posture in Europe. These outposts are a requisite for American power projection and reassurance while supporting deterrence. But that does support the conclusion drawn by one recent paper that argued that current U.S. forward-deployed forces in the Middle East and Indo-Pacific should be held at their present levels and that the American posture in Europe should “increase and expand eastward.” That conclusion fails to address the imbalances in Asia and the strong position of NATO in Europe. This does not suggest that Europe should be left to fend for itself. It is difficult to imagine a case of outright Russian military aggression against a NATO ally that did not involve U.S. forces in combat on the battlefield.

However Europe can and ought to become more competitive in terms of its military modernization programs and enhance its readiness levels. NATO while improving remains far from meeting the 2014 Wales Summit standards for both budgeting levels (2 percent of GDP) and modernization (20 percent of the defense budget). The alliance should quickly move to operationalize its Strategic Concept and make smart investments in command and control air- and ground-delivered munitions and adequate logistics for sustained conflict.

The massive employment of guided weapons including rocket and missile artillery in Ukraine is instructive. The combination of pervasive surveillance and deeper strike systems afford a defensive but operationally relevant advantage that NATO should base its defensive strategy around. Similar lessons should be carefully drawn with regard to mobile surface-to-air systems to meet air defense requirements and deny Russia the use of its fighter-bomber and helicopter assets.

Buying enhanced (mobile) air defenses aerial drones and tactical attack missiles (per Hammes) is a smart procurement priority. Even before this conflict people saw the age of smart loitering munitions coming. The results from contemporary conflict reinforce arguments for greater standoff and precision increased use of drones and loitering munitions and fewer manned helicopters. As noted in these pages the lower barriers to entry in the drone competition “make cheap but effective robotic airpower available to a much broader range of states.” Yet while drones and loitering munitions are making combined arms more effective it is not yet clear that they have revolutionized warfare. Predictably the race for counter-drone capabilities is now ongoing and could offset the apparent advantages offered by more agile unmanned systems. My money is on the continued expansion of these in numbers and at increasingly lower cost compared to existing systems.

A prioritized program for both Europe and the United States would suggest that a substantial investment in both land force ammunition and precision-guided missile stocks including aviation ordnance is needed as a first order of business. The conflict in Ukraine demonstrates that protagonists should expect nearly insatiable consumption rates. As Sir Lawrence Freedman has assessed:

A huge lesson from the war in Ukraine is that the intensity of modern warfare means you go through material and supplies very quickly. The stockpiles are never sufficient. The NATO countries have greatly depleted their supplies supporting Ukraine.

The U.S. Army seems to appreciate this priority and is now seeking to double or triple production for some of these weapons. NATO countries including the United States have limited industrial base capacity and need to rebuild their inventories and rethink the risks involved in limited production capacity to offset large-scale attrition. A shift away from trip-wire forces offset by more robust munition stocks may do more to deter Moscow. At present the “arsenal of democracy” will have empty shelves for some time.

Combat operations in Ukraine offer evidence for systems like the Javelin the Next-generation Light Anti-tank Weapon (more commonly known as the NLAW) and the Switchblade 600 that warrant consideration in the debate about more effective investment strategies. For one modern Western tank one can buy 10 launchers and 100 missiles. The lifecycle costs of the tank — training equipment transport refuelers and maintenance — compound this comparison much further. NATO should seek to impose such costs upon adversaries not itself.

These weapon systems will be increasingly common and are already widely fielded around the world. The Israelis field a family of anti-tank missile systems the Spike system which is being marketed for export as a less expensive alternative to the Javelin and has been sold to numerous countries. The Chinese have the HJ-12 anti-tank guided missile which closely resembles the Javelin and comes with air-launched options. Such systems will undoubtedly continue to proliferate.

These systems will surely alter how Western maneuver and armor systems are employed. Although tanks are not completely obsolete they are increasingly vulnerable to modern anti-tank munitions whether fired from the ground or the air. These new systems have more range lethality and maneuverability than the last generation. The advantages offered by these systems against maneuver platforms including the once-potent tank are unlikely to be offset by merely using better camouflage or better tactics than Russian forces to screen armor advances.

There are surely potential contingencies where offensive maneuver is needed to support counterattacks or to seize or deny ground that confers a position of advantage. Armored mobility will remain useful in these instances. There are scenarios where the terrain and the rival’s force design make tanks useful. Yet in other scenarios what constitutes “combined arms” will have to be refined to reflect changes in the character of warfare. Clearly unmanned aerial systems are having an impact beyond just intelligence and targeting. The shibboleth that only a 72-ton tank can provide the protection firepower and mobility required for operational success will be severely tested in a future war.

Certainly tanks afford protection against small arms and shrapnel but only modern active protection systems can hope to thwart modern munitions and the tank’s logistics train is easily identified and even more vulnerable. This degrades the operational value of the total system. It is comforting to have them advance as the force maneuvers into the adversary’s weapons-engagement range. Unfortunately that danger zone is now much larger and more lethal exposing maneuver forces to precise fires at far greater ranges and while taking losses the entire time when competing against an opponent capable of modern combined arms.

Clearly Steve Biddle disagrees. While he and I agree about the enduring need for offensive maneuver he does not seem to accept that it is far harder to maneuver in an age of persistent surveillance coupled with proliferating armor-killing weapons. It is in my view unhelpful to compare Ukraine’s advances into Kharkiv in September to “the German conquest of France in 1940 or the Six Day War of 1967 or Operation Desert Storm in 1991” as Biddle does. The different scales and methods of fighting hobble such comparisons. To be useful historical analogies must survive discontinuities which include in this case loitering munitions and other low-cost hand-held easy-to-operate unmanned aerial systems and anti-tank missiles. Biddle does not account for the increasing costs involved in maneuver which are now intimately and painfully familiar to Russia. Nor does he project the impact of improved munitions and the air-launched options that military analysts expect to evolve and proliferate. Both sides in Ukraine are using existing 20th century assets with improvised enhancements. Neither is fielding a force designed to exploit combined arms to enhance a defense with a weapons-engagement zone of longer ranges. The U.S. armed services need to anticipate competition with adversaries who learn from this conflict and not assume that they will only fight opponents that repeat the woeful command-and-control flaws of the Russian military. The U.S. military cannot be “future-proofed” with false comparisons.

To be sure the tank is not dead. U.S. forces have and will continue to employ armor. Clearly Ukraine is making good use of its tanks and could use more advanced models. But for the United States it’s just not a priority investment for fighting sophisticated peers in high-intensity combat going forward. As Chris Dougherty has noted the value of marginal investments in this platform over other deficiencies — secure command and control unmanned aviation munitions stocks etc. — is the key question for U.S. force planning. The issue goes beyond bad Russian tactics or tank design given the proven cost effectiveness of increasingly lethal systems designed to defeat modern armor with top-down munitions or precision fires. Despite their limitations cuts in armor in Europe or the U.S. Army are not warranted. That said increased numbers of heavy armor or an expanded permanent U.S. force presence in Europe are not strategically warranted either.

Rather than threatening Russia with armor forces up to its border a more defensive orientation is best suited for a strategy of denial in this age. Shifting to a strategy of denial does not require tank-heavy maneuver formations or large numbers of lumbering towed artillery systems. Instead it relies upon significant precision fires including High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems and self-propelled precision artillery. In addition to markedly bolstering deterrence an investment package that deters but does not exacerbate Putin’s security dilemma has more merit than replaying World War II tank battles.

At the strategic level there is a transformational opportunity here to support a smarter sustainable and more cooperative defense of Europe. This opportunity should not be lost especially as NATO’s “New Force Model” is being developed. Analysts in Europe have assessed the stark changes in the region’s security environment and recognize the necessity to assume “a greater role in maintaining peace and stability in its own region and neighborhood.” NATO’s European members should be able to take the lead in many areas including more and better ground combat forces and not require major U.S. contributions or augmentation for every combat function. Ukraine offers a compelling example of where the United States has an arsenal for allies or partners to draw upon. Security assistance is a valuable component of U.S. strategy but it is not a universal template or a future American way of warfare.

NATO ought to revitalize its modernization plans and reintroduce what Sean Monaghan reminds us was once known as the “hedgehog defense.” Such an approach calls for extensive investment in long-range precision strike systems — including artillery munitions unmanned aerial systems and missile defenses — which favors NATO’s strengths. This should guide NATO’s transformation and the implementation of the Strategic Concept issued in Madrid in 2022 as well as how the U.S. military contributes to the alliance with its unique strengths. This may not reduce Washington’s defense expenditures on the continent much but it will shape how these resources are allocated. It should also shape the Department of Defense’s design and development priorities beyond this theater for conflict in Asia as well.

Implications

The shift between offense and defense has both operational and strategic implications. These implications need greater study including differentiation over a wider range of domains. The balance is rarely static and tomorrow’s opponents are undoubtedly already at work on their counter-revolution. Russia is going to learn and adapt as no doubt others will. The first implication is the need to recognize the signposts from recent conflicts. The implications of exploiting emerging technologies and implementing a reinvigorated national innovation strategy will be evident to those willing to rigorously evaluate their potential. Many legacy systems including heavy armor will have value in other contexts. So do not melt down any tanks just yet but do appreciate the implications of modern low-cost anti-armor and unmanned aerial systems that require limited training. Ukraine’s small but successful naval actions could also be significant as portents especially in unconventional applications in contested littoral regions.

Second Europe’s systemic advantages versus Moscow provide a favorable balance of power. Admittedly the argument is based on resource inputs instead of real capability outcomes and those are divided over 30 allies (hopefully 32 in the near future). Arguments for Western force planners to invest less in the ideology of the offense should be heeded especially in regard to land forces dedicated to deterring Russia. Instead the ideology of collective defense in Europe should be retained and strengthened as NATO consolidates after the war in Ukraine. This will require continued attention to Europe’s military modernization. Europe should focus on operational credibility as a necessary stepping stone if it truly seeks strategic autonomy — and that focus needs to start with Germany which needs to put more emphasis on actually delivering on its words.

Third it is time for U.S. strategists to consider the larger global picture and the reality that choices involve tradeoffs. American policymakers understandably want to aid Ukraine’s embattled democracy. Ensuring that Moscow does not succeed is important. However policymakers cannot lose sight of strategic priorities and risk continued investment shortfalls in Asia either. The next few years will pose severe challenges to U.S. technological competitiveness and military security. It’s long past time to get serious in the Pacific. China’s diplomatic behavior and military modernization have not become more benign although its economy has slowed sharply. Some argue that it may be more aggressive as its economic power declines which is worrisome. Others fear that the United States is moving too slowly and running out of time to deter aggression against Taiwan.

Less symbolism and more substance are needed to stabilize the Indo-Pacific region. As Luis Simon has noted in these pages “The existence of strategic tradeoffs between Europe and the Indo-Pacific is very real. What the United States does in one region impinges on its ability to resource deterrence in the other region.”

Conclusion

Grasping the larger strategic context and applying scarce resources in a disciplined manner is what separates good and bad strategy. Washington is often accused of responding to the crisis du jour rather than hewing to a disciplined strategy that matches ends with means. With respect to Asia it is time to align words with action. As stated at the opening misguided investments in either theater could lead to strategic defeat.

Balancing risk and making such tradeoffs is the essence of strategy and these essential choices should be reflected in future U.S. grand strategy.

To assess the clinical relevance of CDCP1 in UC we first performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of human CDCP1 on paraffin-embedded human bladder cancer samples based on the previously described protocol12. We examined a cohort of 147 specimens spanning from T1 to T4 stages (Table 1)29 30 and stratified samples based on their membrane staining for CDCP1 into four groups (negative weak moderate and strong). All groups with negative or weak staining intensity were classified as CDCP1-low while moderate and strong groups were classified as CDCP1-high (Fig. 1A). In line with previous results28 31 CDCP1 expression was negatively or weakly expressed in normal urothelium or normal adjacent tissue (NAT) (Supplementary Fig. 1). A large portion of urothelial tumors at T1 and T2 stages were classified as negative/weak for CDCP1 (CDCP1-low) while the 35% of T3 and 50% of T4 showed high expression levels of CDCP1 (CDCP1-high) (Fig. 1B). Of note levels of CDCP1 in muscular invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) stages (T2-T4) are significantly higher than in the non-invasive stage (T1) (Fig. 1C). Most importantly patients with CDCP1-high expression showed a significant poorer outcome compared to patients with CDCP1-low expression levels (Log Rank mantel cox test P < 0.0001) (Fig. 1D). In parallel we performed western blot and real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analyses (n = 10 and n = 107 respectively) on additional UC frozen samples and the corresponding NAT. These analyses demonstrated a robust increase of CDCP1 expression at protein and RNA levels in UC when compared to NAT (Fig. 1EF). Taken together these data showed that CDCP1 is overexpressed in UC compared to normal tissues and its overexpression is associated with advanced UC and shorter overall survival (OS).

CDCP1 expression is elevated in advanced UC and enriched in Ba/Sq subtype

To gain further insights about the expression of CDCP1 in UC we analyzed CDCP1 expression in two publically available data sets. The first consisting of 405 tissue specimens of bladder cancer from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) was classified according to the consensus subtyping approach of muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer (MIBC)32. In line with our previous results we observed elevated levels of CDCP1 in UC compared to its NAT (Fig. 2A). Importantly we found that CDCP1 levels were strongly associated with the Ba/Sq subtype (Fig. 2B). This was confirmed using a second data set a single-cell-RNA-sequencing (scRNAseq) of human UC samples33. Indeed analysis of this dataset for cells annotated as epithelial origin revealed that expression of CDCP1 and that of markers reported to be enriched in the Ba/Sq subtype such as EGFR KRT5 (CK5) and KRT14 (CK14) have a high degree of co-localization (Fig. 2C). Thereafter we performed IHC of CDCP1 on a well-established prospectively recruited consecutive cohort of MIBC patients treated with radical cystectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy as previously described (Table 2)32. The multivariate analysis on this cohort demonstrated that CDCP1 is not an independent variable for the prediction of patients´ prognosis (Table 3). However out of 184 analyzed tumors 56% were positive for CDCP1 (Fig. 2D) and we found a strong association between CDCP1 protein expression and the Ba/Sq subtype (Fig. 2E). This association with the Ba/Sq subtype of UC was further validated using the Ba/Sq subtype markers CK5 and CK1432 (Fig. 2F). Of note the mRNA levels of CDCP1 reflected the protein levels observed in this cohort (Fig. 2G) and were enriched in the Ba/Sq subtype (Kruskal Wallis: P < 000.1) (Fig. 2H). Together these results confirm the association of CDCP1 expression with the aggressive Ba/Sq UC subtype. Moreover considering that several studies have already reported the association of CDCP1 with therapy resistance6 we questioned whether this protein has the same impact on MIBC. The OS of chemo-treated patients expressing high CDCP1 levels is clearly reduced (Fig. 2I) suggesting that CDCP1 may be a suitable marker for chemotherapy sensitivity and targeting CDCP1 could serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to treat resistant patients.

Transgenic overexpression of CDCP1 induces proliferation in ex vivo mouse organoids and its knockout inhibits proliferation and migration of UC cells

To model the effect of CDCP1 overexpression in UC we exploited the previously generated transgenic mouse model for CDCP1 (CDCP1pcLSL/+) and established an ex vivo 3D organoids system that overexpresses CDCP112. Briefly the bladder of 8 weeks old male CDCP1pcLSL/+ mice was excised and dissociated into single cells as previously described33. Bladder cells were infected with an adeno-Cre virus to induce the expression of CDCP1 and seeded in Matrigel (Fig. 3A). We examined the effect of CDCP1 expression on the growth of bladder mouse organoids over two weeks. CDCP1 overexpression resulted in the formation of larger and morphologically distinctive organoids compared to the controls (Fig. 3B). Quantification of the organoids area revealed a significant increase in their size when CDCP1 is overexpressed compared to the controls (Fig. 3C). At the molecular level IHC analysis on mouse organoids confirmed the expression of CDCP1 (Fig. 3D). Importantly CDCP1 overexpressing organoids expressed high levels of Ki67 and pERK (Fig. 3D). To further assess the relevance of these findings in human UC we aimed to perform CDCP1 knockout (KO) in CDCP1 expressing cells with the CRISPR/Cas9 method. Firstly we screened several UC cell lines for their CDCP1 expression. Western blot analysis indicated variable expression of CDCP1 among the tested UC cell lines (Supplementary Fig. 2A). Given the fact that CDCP1 expression was associated with Ba/Sq subtype and it is highly expressed in the Ba/Sq SCaBER cells we generated KO of CDCP1 in this cell line (Fig. 3E). Interestingly loss of CDCP1 in SCaBER cells reduced pAKT pMEK and pERK1/2 levels (Fig. 3E and supplementary Fig. 2B). Functional analyses showed that CDCP1 depletion reduced both 2D and 3D proliferation (Fig. 3FG) and migration in this cell line (Fig. 3H). Interestingly T24 and TCCSUP cells which are considered non-type34 35 showed a similar behavior to SCaBER when knocked out for CDCP1 with the exception for the 2D proliferation (Supplementary Fig. 2C–F). Collectively these results demonstrate that CDCP1 expression promotes UC proliferation while its downregulation reduces proliferation and migration of UC cell lines.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMie2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmNvbnRyYWN0cGhhcm1hLmNvbS9jb250ZW50cy92aWV3X2JyZWFraW5nLW5ld3MvMjAyMy0wMi0wMS9leG90aGVyYS1uYW1lcy1kYXJyZW4tbGV2YS1hcy1jaGllZi1idXNpbmVzcy1vZmZpY2VyL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Exothera Names Darren Leva As Chief Business Officer,"Breaking News

Happy New Year! The last time we checked in with the Duttons it was before Christmas and Jamie was plotting how to impeach his father. On this week’s mid-season finale — the last episode until summer! — we catch up with some old friends plan assassinations and say goodbye to some Texas-bound cowboys. Dry your tears and chug some whiskey as you catch up with this week’s recap:

More from Variety

Young Rip (Kyle Red Silverstein) seems pretty confident throwing his first person into the Dutton murder pit. I’d be sweating more!

Young John (Josh Lucas) discussing the branding with Young Rip and the latter’s subsequent acceptance with his fellow cowboys was heartwarming. After a youth spent wandering Rip finally has a home and a family!

Oh hello Jimmy (Jefferson White)! We’ve missed you!

Even though the 6666 turned Jimmy into a real cowboy he’s still distracted enough by Emily (Kathryn Kelly) taking her top off to miss breakfast. At least he’s grown in his personal life too!

Emily definitely has the harder job having to sonogram horses vs. ride and rope them all day. Jimmy should make her dinner.

At least he’s making up for it with foot rubs. Could this be the healthiest relationship on “Yellowstone”?

Big laugh at John (Kevin Costner) coming to Monica (Kelsey Asbille) directly to see if Kayce (Luke Grimes) can run the farm. Smart man!

Wow John hugging Kayce and telling him “I love you son?” That’s ominous.

I’m obsessed with all of the rough-and-tumble companies that run ads during “Yellowstone”: Tractor Supply Co. Ariat Filson Tecovas. They make me feel like such a rugged outdoorsman that sure I will buy a ticket to the upcoming Gerard Butler action movie simply titled “Plane.”

Jamie (Wes Bentley) has perfected his devastating smirk. You are such a twerp Jamie!

This is some great crosscutting between two Dutton men giving speeches.

John’s last word to the press before leaving was a surprisingly rousing.

John teaching Clara (Lilli Kay) how to fight with “menace”…excited to see how this mentorship plays out!

I guess Beth (Kelly Reilly) doesn’t like Summer (Piper Perabo) anymore? It’s hard to keep up…

“Where’s your dad live? I’ll go fuck him.” Bless you Beth.

Beth’s wild eyes make me nervous…what will she do to Jamie?!?

Wow Teeter (Jennifer Landon) also said “I love you” to Colby (Denim Richards) this episoe. So many emotions!

How is Jamie at all surprised that Beth would show up in the middle of the night and do something crazy?

Ouch! That rock to the head would give Jamie brain damage right? I know it’s a TV show but yikes!

Wait…Beth didn’t know that the Train Station was a communal body pit? It seems like everyone involved with the ranch knew!

“Future generations of which you have none…” Ouch Jamie! Too low!

Ugh Sarah (Dawn Olivieri) just stay upstairs! Jamie just about had the upper hand with Beth and you took it from him.

Beth you can’t kill Jamie and dump him in the Train Station. You’d be at the top of the suspect list.

Oh but now Jamie is going to try to kill Beth? Can these two siblings ever get along?

See you again this summer!

Here’s what to expect on Norway’s coastal voyage.

Since 1893 various cargo and passenger vessels have operated a scheduled service along the Norwegian coastline. Hurtigruten and Havila ships still carry both cargo and local passengers but they are best known outside Norway for their roundtrip voyages aimed at tourists.

When I first moved to Norway I quickly got to hear about Hurtigruten despite living in Oslo. As I began to travel around the country I soon began to recognise the iconic vessels.

But it took me almost eight years before I finally set foot on a Hurtigruten vessel myself. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and learned so much about the history the benefits of the voyage—plus the kind of people who won’t enjoy it.

So if you're considering taking a coastal voyage or that intro has piqued your interest this article is for you.

Introducing Norway’s coastal voyage

While it's possible to take the Hurtigruten port-to-port as a local ferry service the full coastal voyage is what we're concerned with in this article.

Havila Castor on the Geirangerfjord.

Norway's classic coastal voyage from Bergen to Kirkenes and back to Bergen takes 12 days. Departures are available on most days throughout the year. Many tourists with limited time take a one-way trip and fly the other leg.

Hurtigruten Norway: Check the latest fares and availability on the Norwegian coastal cruise.

For a few decades Hurtigruten has been the sole operator of the coastal route. But following a government decision to introduce competition on the route tourists now have some choice.

With its brand new eco-friendly ships Havila Voyages points towards the future of the coastal voyage and is well worth consideration as an alternative to Hurtigruten.

What to expect on a Norwegian coastal cruise

Hurtigruten and Havila are not necessarily marketed as cruises rather as “voyages”. Nevertheless they are considered ‘cruises' by many in the travel industry and often referred to as such in the media.

While spending a week or two on a coastal voyage has a lot in common with a more traditional cruise there are some key differences that often trip up even seasoned travellers.

Cruise ships vs. Norway coastal vessels

First things first the ships. The vessels from both Hurtigruten and Havila are not cruise ships. While they are well fitted out the ships don't offer a lot of the entertainments you’ll find on more traditional cruise lines. It's the ever-changing Norwegian coastline and multiple port calls that are the main attractions.

In fact I would suggest that Hurtigruten ships have just as much in common with the cruise ferries that shuttle people between countries all over Northern Europe albeit without the emphasis on partying and duty-free sales.

Port calls

The other biggest difference from a cruise is the number of port calls. Most traditional cruises have one port call per day if that.

Norwegian coastal voyages are still working ships that transport cargo between the 34 ports along the route. They call at many of the smaller ports for just 15-30 minutes just enough time to unload and load cargo and local passengers.

The coastal voyage runs year-round.

Roundtrip cruise passengers do get a few hours to wander around bigger ports like Ålesund Trondheim and Tromsø but that’s still much less time than with traditional cruise lines.

This arrangement is a double-edged sword for tourists. With so many port calls the ships are never far from the coastline which is why the views of the coastline are so famous.

But if you're the kind of person who likes to spend a lot of time on land this may not be for you. That being said organised excursions are available to help you make the most of the limited time in port.

Onboard dining

One thing that the coastal cruise does have in common with cruise ships is the focus on premium sustainable dining.

Both Hurtigruten and Havila push their local food concepts heavily. Both lines understandably place an emphasis on fish and seafood together with local food and seasonal ingredients obtained from the various ports along the route.

Final day lunch on the Hurtigruten voyage.

There are a few differences though. Hurtigruten ships feature a classic restaurant with breakfast and lunch buffets and table service for dinner alongside at least one premium dining option. Havila offers table service for all three daily meals.

The food on Hurtigruten is outstanding with no need for snacks between meals! On my recent trip on the Havila Castor I was able to enjoy breakfast and lunch. The small dish concept is excellent and means you can easily adjust what you eat based on your appetite.

Both lines also operate speciality restaurants at an extra charge although this is included for suite guests I believe. Alcohol is expensive on both lines and many people I sailed with chose not to partake in alcohol during their voyage.

Port highlights of the Norway coastal voyage

As mentioned there are several ports along the route where the ship docks for several hours. Ålesund Trondheim and Tromsø are particular highlights.

But it also spends an hour or two in some intriguing places. That's enough time for you to have a wander around. These include Bodø and Svolvær among many others.

Hurtigruten ship MS Nordnorge.

Some of the shortest port calls are well worth being out on deck for such as Stamsund in Lofoten and many of the other small ports in Northern Norway.

If you want to get an idea of what to expect consider wading your way through my Hurtigruten Diary from my 2019 trip! It's a day-by-day account of my full roundtrip voyage. Just bear in mind it was done in January at one of the darkest times of the year!

Hurtigruten or Havila?

You can read more about the famous name on the route with this introduction to Hurtigruten. But while Hurtigruten’s famous brand is a big part of the appeal of a coastal cruise don’t ignore Havila for that reason alone.

Hurtigruten Norway: Check the latest fares and availability on the Norwegian coastal cruise.

Havila's vessels offer an extremely similar experience with the advantage of being brand new. They can also sail on battery power for hours at a time. If you’re concerned with the environmental impact of such voyages this may sway your decision.

That being said Hurtigruten is also investing heavily in greener ships. Its fleet is in the process of being retrofitted with hybrid technology while the company pursues its plan to introduce zero-emissions vessels by 2030.

Havila Voyages have introduced brand new ships.

Ultimately the line for you may come down to your preferred dates. Daily departures on the coastal route are shared between Hurtigruten and Havila. So if you have a specific date in mind the decision on which line and which ship will be made for you.

Hurtigruten’s special itineraries for 2023-24

To mark the coastal route’s 130th anniversary Hurtigruten has launched two new itineraries set apart from the traditional coastal route. Both routes spend more hours in fewer ports for a more cruise-like experience.

The ‘Svalbard Express’ offers travelers a return trip from Bergen to the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard while the ‘North Cape Express’ is the first ever Hurtigruten itinerary to depart from Norway’s capital city Oslo.

Sister company Hurtigruten Expeditions (soon to become HX) offers expedition cruises to Svalbard the Norwegian fjords Iceland Greenland and many other destinations around the world. Many of these utilise newer expedition cruise ships.

When to take a coastal cruise

Typically Norway’s ‘cruise season' runs from May to September in and around the fjord region. Some cruise lines offer northern lights specific cruises in the winter months.

But it's a different story on the Norway coastal cruise. The route's double life as local transport means the voyages run year-round.

If you don’t mind a full vessel and budget isn't much of a concern the summer is a wonderful time to visit the Norwegian coastline. The vessels tend to adjust their itineraries to spend time in the Geirangerfjord as an added bonus.

Hurtigruten and Havila call at the Geirangerfjord in the summer.

The main reason to take the voyage from October to March is the opportunity to see the northern lights. Or perhaps I should say the possibility. This is never guaranteed of course but spending almost a week north of the Arctic circle mostly away from city lights gives you a good chance–if the skies are clear.

Prices tend to be lower but it’s also much colder and of course the darkness means you’ll see less of the coastline during the daytime.

For me shoulder seasons are where the best value lies. Fares are lower than in the summer and the ships may still be quieter. Of course the weather may still be uncertain.

A few Hurtigruten employees have told me the autumn is their preferred time. The landscape is golden and you can watch the seasons change as you sail. Plus most itineraries in the autumn include a sailing down the scenic Hjørundfjord.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1eHVyeWxpZmVzdHlsZW1hZy5jby51ay90cmF2ZWwvdGhlLWJlc3QtbHV4dXJ5LXNvbG8tdHJhdmVsLWlkZWFzLWZvci0yMDIzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,The best luxury solo travel ideas for 2023,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMiV2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmx1eHVyeWxpZmVzdHlsZW1hZy5jby51ay90cmF2ZWwvdGhlLWJlc3QtbHV4dXJ5LXNvbG8tdHJhdmVsLWlkZWFzLWZvci0yMDIzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E4868970>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

Pet food and treat sales declined slightly for General Mills in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023 although operating profits increased 34% compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. General Mills pet segment sales were US$592.9 million in Q2 FY23 compared with US$593.4 million during the same period of the previous fiscal year. However General Mills’ pet food sales increased by 8% when considering the six months ending Nov. 27 2022.

In 2021 General Mills purchased Tyson Foods pet treats business for approximately US$1.2 billion. In 2018 General Mills acquired premium pet food company Blue Buffalo. General Mills pet segment’s annual revenue reached US$1732000 in 2021 according to Petfood Industry’s Top Companies Current Data.

General Mills' pet segment performance

“Organic net sales were flat. Net sales performance was negatively impacted by a reduction in retailer inventory with all-channel retail sales up high single digits in the quarter” General Mills representatives said on Dec. 20 in a press release. “Excluding the retailer inventory change net sales results were broadly in line with company expectations and reflected continued strength of the Blue Buffalo brand partially offset by a short-term headwind from capacity constraints and related customer service challenges. Pet net sales performance is expected to accelerate in the second half of fiscal 2023 due to increased capacity improved customer service increased brand-building investment and an expectation for stable retailer inventory levels.

“Segment operating profit totaled US$87 million compared to US$132 million a year ago driven primarily by high-teens input cost inflation a significant increase in costs related to capacity expansion and supply chain disruptions and lower volume including the impact of the retailer inventory reduction. These headwinds were partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix.

“Through six months Pet segment net sales increased 8 percent to $1.2 billion including a 2-point benefit from the pet treats acquisition. Organic net sales were up 6 percent. Segment operating profit was down 15 percent to $210 million driven primarily by higher input costs lower volume and higher SG&A expenses partially offset by favorable net price realization and mix.

“During the first quarter of fiscal 2022 we acquired the pet treats business for US$1.2 billion in cash. We financed the transaction with a combination of cash on hand and short-term debt. We consolidated the pet treats business into our consolidated balance sheets and recorded goodwill of US$762 million indefinite-lived intangible assets for the Nudges Top Chews and True Chews brands totaling US$330 million in aggregate and a finite-lived customer relationship asset of US$40 million. The goodwill is included in the Pet segment and is deductible for tax purposes. The pro forma effects of this acquisition were not material.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxzaW1wbGUuY29tL2Zvb2QtcmVjaXBlcy9zaG9wcGluZy1zdG9yaW5nL2Zvb2QvbW9zdC1wb3B1bGFyLWZvb2QtZGVsaXZlcnktb3JkZXJzLXViZXItZWF0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Are the Most Popular Food Delivery Orders in the U.S. According to Uber Eats,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.realsimple.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /food-recipes/shopping-storing/food/most-popular-food-delivery-orders-uber-eats (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E35DA500>, 'Connection to www.realsimple.com timed out.

Roberts Jr. does the honors. In others it might be Justice Sonia Sotomayor or Justice Clarence Thomas presenting the squared-off hunks of marble affixed with the Supreme Court’s gilded seal.

Hewed from slabs left over from the 1930s construction of the nation’s high court and handed out in its magnificent Great Hall they are a unique status symbol in a town that craves them. And while the ideological bents of the justices bestowing them might vary there is one constant: All the recipients have given at least $5000 to a charity favored by the justices and more often than not the donors have a significant stake in the way the court decides cases.

The charity the Supreme Court Historical Society is ostensibly independent of the judicial branch of government but in reality the two are inextricably intertwined. The charity’s stated mission is straightforward: to preserve the court’s history and educate the public about the court’s importance in American life. But over the years the society has also become a vehicle for those seeking access to nine of the most reclusive and powerful people in the nation. The justices attend the society’s annual black-tie dinner soirees where they mingle with donors and thank them for their generosity and serve as M.C.s to more regular society-sponsored lectures or re-enactments of famous cases.

The society has raised more than $23 million over the last two decades. Because of its nonprofit status it does not have to publicly disclose its donors — and declined when asked to do so. But The New York Times was able to identify the sources behind more than $10.7 million raised since 2003 the first year for which relevant records were available.",,,,,,

Spencer Platt/Getty

Katie Thomas is a senior executive assistant at Uber and a former assistant to Postmates' CFO.

She worked her way up in tech by networking and posting frequently on LinkedIn.

She says coming prepared with smart questions and research on an executive is key for interviews.

Katie Thomas has been a senior executive business partner at Uber since March 2021 after the ride-hailing giant acquired her previous employer Postmates for $2.65 billion. Before that she was the executive assistant to Postmates' chief financial officer.

A self-described introvert who seeks out careers with ""mission-driven companies"" Thomas worked her way into Big Tech after starting as a receptionist for a private-equity firm. She told Jessica Vann the CEO of Maven Recruiting Group on a recent episode of the podcast ""Reach"" that ""taking a shot"" with a good first impression — whether in real life or online — early in her career opened a lot of doors.

Her first piece of advice to anyone starting out is to be active on LinkedIn and connect with people whose career paths mirror your goals. Here's how — and her tips for interviewing for a role at a big tech company.

Be honest and be yourself

A few months after beginning her role at Postmates in April 2020 Thomas posted on LinkedIn about her ""unusual journey"" starting a job entirely remotely expressing gratitude for ""the chance to expand my horizons and challenge myself."" The post received more than 3000 likes and 100 comments.

""That was an inspiring moment"" Thomas said on the podcast. Since then she added she's grown her profile to more than 2200 followers by ""recognizing my value and the accomplishments I have made.""

For anyone trying to be more active on the platform she warned against copying how others engage. ""Be as authentic as possible in the things that you like and the things that you comment on the people you connect with"" she said.

Send your message far and wide

Thomas' position with Postmates was also her first time assisting anyone in the C-suite. So eager to find a mentor who could guide her through this new challenge Thomas messaged about 30 to 40 executive assistants who supported CFOs in the tech industry.

She said she told them it was her first time working in tech and for a C-suite and asked for any tips and tricks. She added that while she got only a few responses ""those few people that I was able to connect with I still connect with to this day.""

These contacts she said remained some of her ""biggest cheerleaders"" as she transitioned to new roles in the industry.

Be bold in a way that works for you

Thomas said she often finds networking and work events draining so it was crucial to find ""that right method or tool that works for you.""

Once when covering for someone on leave Thomas had to reschedule an executive's meeting with Salesforce. Thomas Googled the executive assistant at Salesforce and saw that she had an impressive background.

""She was where I wanted to be five or 10 years from now"" Thomas said. Getting a ""good vibe"" from email exchanges Thomas said she asked if the other executive assistant wanted to get a coffee or a drink.







""The worst they can say is no"" Thomas said.

Thomas said that they went for a drink a few weeks later and that the executive assistant ""really helped me think through what my next steps would be.""

Thomas credited this experience with pushing her to be bolder when it came to LinkedIn and other networking opportunities.

Come prepared with talking points

Thomas said positivity is her superpower in interviewing for roles in tech. ""People understand who I am right off the bat and that sometimes that might not work for everyone"" she said. But by being authentic Thomas added she can ""weed out"" people she might not enjoy working for.

Asking smart questions is crucial too. ""It's easy to be asked questions the whole time and not come prepared with ones of your own"" Thomas said. Some of her favorite to ask are ""How much time do you spend with your direct reports?"" ""What are your priorities in your business as well as your personal life?"" and ""Are there are other executive assistants I may be working with?""

If the answer to the last question is yes Thomas said she'll ask herself: ""Are they also excited about their growth? Are they willing to help and help me understand what's going on?""

She added that executive assistants should be prepared with ""points of why you want to work there and what's important to you and the things that are exciting to you about what that company is doing.""

She said that in her experience interviewers want to hear about an interviewee's ideas and goals — what they're working toward and whether they're going to partner with the executive and match them in terms of hard work and care. ""I always make sure that I am researching what they're doing and the things I want to help with"" Thomas said.

Thomas said that finding the right executive to ""grow with me"" has been another key to her success. That means supporting someone who understands her goals — one of which she said is ""working with other kind people.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxzaW1wbGUuY29tL2Zvb2QtcmVjaXBlcy9zaG9wcGluZy1zdG9yaW5nL2Zvb2QvbW9zdC1wb3B1bGFyLWZvb2QtZGVsaXZlcnktb3JkZXJzLXViZXItZWF0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,These Are the Most Popular Food Delivery Orders in the U.S. According to Uber Eats,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.realsimple.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /food-recipes/shopping-storing/food/most-popular-food-delivery-orders-uber-eats (Caused by NewConnectionError('<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E430DDE0>: Failed to establish a new connection: [Errno 11001] getaddrinfo failed')) on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnJlYWxzaW1wbGUuY29tL2Zvb2QtcmVjaXBlcy9zaG9wcGluZy1zdG9yaW5nL2Zvb2QvbW9zdC1wb3B1bGFyLWZvb2QtZGVsaXZlcnktb3JkZXJzLXViZXItZWF0c9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnNhbmRpZWdvcmVhZGVyLmNvbS9uZXdzLzIwMjMvamFuLzAyL3N0cmluZ2Vycy11YmVyLWRyaXZlcnMtc291dGh3ZXN0LW1lbHQtZG93bi_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Uber drivers share war stories of Southwest melt-down,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.sandiegoreader.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /news/2023/jan/02/stringers-uber-drivers-southwest-melt-down/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E430D000>, 'Connection to www.sandiegoreader.com timed out.

Only a year old it is already stocked at Ulta Beauty.

Despite Youthforia’s success on TikTok founder and CEO Fiona Chan joined a Meta event earlier this month to help hype up the potential for its competing platform Instagram Reels. She shared that when it comes to sales it’s actually Reels that is the “source of the best-converting organic content” for the brand.

Meta’s ad revenue has taken a hit in the wake of Apple’s new opt-in requirement for data tracking. Now the company is working to show brands what can be achieved through marketing on Instagram and Facebook with dramatically diminished data tracking. For a December Zoom panel discussion with press on the topic the company highlighted Youthforia as a brand that has been able to find success on the platform.

“It’s definitely a dynamic and challenging time for businesses” Katherine Shappley vp of the commerce business group at Meta said during the talk. “​​We know it’s gotten harder to measure campaigns and in many cases that’s due to under-reporting because of the changes with Apple.”

According to research by Glossy partner publication Digiday 42% of agency professionals said in Q3 that they’re “confident” that Instagram “drives marketing success for their clients.” That was down from 49% who said the same in Q1 of this year. The platform came in fifth place for platforms driving the most confidence in Q3 down from third place in Q1. Facebook meanwhile remained in second place from Q1 to Q3 with 51% expressing confidence in the platform.

In its third-quarter financial results Meta reported a 4% year-over-year drop in revenue for July-September. Following that report the company laid off 11000 employees in November.

Apple’s new privacy rules on iOS which require apps to ask users permission before tracking their data went into effect in April 2021. According to data from app monetization startup Flurry only around 25% of users currently opt in to allow app tracking.

According to Shappley Meta is defining the time period after the changes went into effect as its “direct-to-community” era when “brands are relying on a mix of paid and organic strategies.” The company is heavily encouraging the use of Reels by brands highlighting that Reels usage is up 50% from six months ago with 140 billion daily plays across Facebook and Instagram.

“Businesses are behaving more like creators in some ways and using organic content to source feedback from customers” she said.

In the case of Youthforia that has meant focusing on organic Reels posts “whether that’s on our own or through customers or influencers and supplementing that with ads” said Chan. And the brand still uses targeting where it can: When it launched in Credo Beauty and Ulta Beauty for example it used geolocation to show Instagram ads to customers near store locations.

In addition to Youthforia body-care brand Soft Services also saw more sales from Reels than TikTok according to co-founder Rebecca Zhou in June this year.

But with limited data availability the brand’s focus has been much more on the content itself relying on Instagram DMs for post ideas.

“A lot of our most-engaging ads or best-performing ads came off the back of community-driven questions” said Chan. In addition “A lot of our growth came when we shared something very unique [like] why we created the products or what experiences I was going through as a first-time founder.”

Meta has been creating content to advise brands on how to adjust their ad strategies to the new changes. For example it created a five-point list of best practices that include minimizing spending on new ad sets and investing more in creator content. It has also been emphasizing the use of its social shopping features as well as its Advantage+ program unveiled August. The latter uses AI to automate ad testing of up to 150 creative combinations at once.

“We’ve been very focused on investing in technology machine learning and privacy-enhancing technology and that’s helping us deliver better ads to people while using less data” said Shappley. She added that Meta has “closed the under-reporting gap due to the iOS changes from 15% in September of last year … down to about 8%.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMieGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJlYXV0eXBhY2thZ2luZy5jb20vaXNzdWVzLzIwMjMtMDEtMDEvdmlld19mZWF0dXJlcy9wYWNpZmljYS1iZWF1dHktc3RpbGwtcHVzaGluZy1ib3VuZGFyaWVzLWFmdGVyLTI1LXllYXJzL9IBAA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Pacifica—Our Beauty Company of the Year—Is Still Pushing Boundaries After 25 Years,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='www.beautypackaging.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /issues/2023-01-01/view_features/pacifica-beauty-still-pushing-boundaries-after-25-years/ (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E31DB970>, 'Connection to www.beautypackaging.com timed out.

Whether you shop online or are walking through a store you’ll find product after product categorized as “clean beauty”—and people are snapping them up. According to market research company Statista over half of women prefer natural or organic products when they shop for skincare. While it’s crystal-clear that we are in the midst of a clean beauty movement defining it is more than a little murky. For some clean beauty means that formulas contain only natural “nontoxic” ingredients. Others say it also has to do with a product being sustainably and ethically produced. And then there are those who expect clean beauty to check both boxes—and a few others.

The predicted value of the clean beauty market is $59 billion in 2031.

The tricky thing is that although the FDA regulates cosmetics it doesn’t review or approve products or ingredients before they go on the market (a spokesperson points out though that companies must make sure the products are safe under the law. Also the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022 will give the FDA more resources and authority to monitor cosmetic brands and enforce recalls). “In Europe more than 1300 ingredients are prohibited” says Defne Arikan CEO of Bryhel Cosmetic Labs who works closely with chemist Yehiel Amouyal. “But in the U.S. only a [relative] few substances are prohibited by the FDA in formulas.” (The Personal Care Products Council an industry trade group has written that “80 percent of those ingredients have not been used and never would be used as a cosmetics ingredient.”)

This is all to say that terms like clean green and eco-friendly aren’t regulated by a governing body so anyone (or any brand) can interpret and define these terms however they’d like. To help you find products that are clean natural sustainable and effective we called on cosmetic chemists brand founders dermatologists and environmentalists to guide you to the most important attributes of clean beauty products.

Considering the ingredients

Your skin is the largest organ in your body so it makes perfect sense that you’d want to be thoughtful about what you’re slathering on it. Many people will tell you the best way to do that is to pick clean formulas that contain natural ingredients.

This thinking isn’t totally wrong. After all there are a number of great skin-boosting substances found in nature—think shea butter jojoba oil argan oil and many others. Not only that but there are a number of synthetic ingredients that can irritate sensitive skin or harm the environment. For example silicones may pollute the environment and certain sulfates such as SLS (a surfactant or foaming agent) can harm marine ecosystems and be irritating to skin. “One if not the main motivator for formulating my own [clean skincare] line 15 years ago was the knowledge that using products with toxic chemicals outdid any good from the so-called active ingredients within them” says Macrene Alexiades MD a dermatologist in New York City.

But there’s a catch. Just because an ingredient comes from a natural source doesn’t mean it’s unequivocally good for your skin. There are plenty of natural ingredients that can be irritating or even harmful. Poison ivy is a prime example but there are also essential oils purposefully used in skincare that can cause redness or contribute to acne.

And just as “natural” doesn’t mean “good” “synthetic” doesn’t mean “bad.” In fact in some cases synthetic ingredients may be even more eco-friendly than the earth-made versions. “I prefer certain ingredients in their synthetic form in order to ensure purity and higher quality” says Krupa Koestline a cosmetic biochemist and consultant for KKT Consultants. “Colorants fall into this category because natural colorants can contain concerning levels of heavy metals that need to be processed in order to remove them and meet FDA guidelines. Synthetic colorants are produced in a controlled environment and do not contain these heavy metal impurities. [New] synthetic methods for producing vitamins are also preferable because extracting a naturally sourced vitamin depletes natural resources and is an energy-intensive and costly process.”

Companies like Amyris (which is behind popular brands like Stripes and ) are finding ways to marry technology and chemistry to create sustainable safe ingredients that are better for the environment than it would be to use the natural form. Take for example squalene a moisturizing ingredient that is traditionally harvested from shark livers and plant sources like olives (then hydrogenated to become “squalane” for cosmetic use). To create a lab-derived version “we use proprietary yeast strains and sustainably harvested sugarcane” says Daan Thorn Leeson senior director of product innovation at Amyris. “The result is a squalane that has greater quality and is more pure than olive oil squalane.”

At the end of the day those who are shopping for clean beauty tend to be looking for products that contain safe ingredients for them and the world—and that can be accomplished through sustainably culled natural ingredients or smartly made synthetics.



Makeup essentials

Clean cosmetics have come a long way in the performance department: Pigment and formula innovations have led to rich colors and lasting formulas that glide on easily and improve the look and feel of skin.

Good for you and the Earth

While an ingredient list may be the first thing people think of when considering what makes something clean or not it’s not the only factor worth considering. “I wish we could rename the category ‘thoughtful beauty’ because that’s really what it’s about” says Sasha Plavsic founder of Ilia Beauty. This thoughtfulness extends to the environmental and social impacts of a brand. The best formulations consider the safety of the user as well as the environment Koestline notes. And they are “inextricably connected. What goes into our water comes back to us” says Jeannie Jarnot founder of retailer Beauty Heroes and the blue beauty movement which recognizes companies that are focused on trying to make a positive environmental impact.

I wish we could rename the category ‘thoughtful beauty’ because that’s really what it’s about.

Say you prefer natural ingredients. If the farms those ingredients are harvested from are negatively impacting the environment would you feel quite as good using them? Ideally the clean beauty brands you use would work with farms that practice regenerative organic agriculture (as a few brands are starting to do). This is a system of farming practices that rehabilitate the ecosystem and boost natural resources such as rotating both organic crops and grazing cattle and composting. “If regenerative organic agriculture was implemented fully across the globe it would have the potential to offset significant amounts of annual greenhouse gas emissions” says Andrew Smith PhD the chief operating officer at the Rodale Institute a nonprofit organization focused on regenerative organic agriculture.

Though it may not be totally within your reach to investigate where the ingredients in your products are being sourced from it’s worth scanning a brand’s website. If they’re focused on being clean and green they’ll often touch on how they source the material used.

Looking closely at the way your products are packaged is another way to ensure your beauty regimen isn’t wreaking havoc on the earth. In 2018 nearly eight billion units of plastic packaging were produced for beauty and personal care in the United States according to market research firm Euromonitor International. And most of those compacts tubes bottles and wands weren’t recycled. The best thing you can do: Use the products you already have. And seek out those that come in glass aluminum or cardboard—these materials can be recycled multiple times.

You can also look for symbols—a bunny a butterfly and others—on the outer packaging of many clean beauty products. These are seals that brands can use if they meet an organization’s qualifications. Here a cheat sheet of the ones most commonly used.

The Deal with Seals Leaping Bunny None of the ingredients or any iteration of the formula has been tested on animals by the company or companies it contracts with.

The goal is progress not perfection

Most of us don’t have the time to google ingredient lists and sustainability options. Even if we did it’s not foolproof. “For example sometimes ingredients aren’t listed in full like with fragrances and formulas can contain contaminants at trace levels or ingredients that release other ingredients” says Holly Moore who has a master’s in public health and is founder and product developer of The Ingredientist a company that consults with brands committed to sustainability.

So if you are wanting to clean up your routine your objective should be to do what you can. That could mean avoiding overpackaged products or noting what’s in your favorite formulas. You can also consider retailers that vet for you. Clean beauty companies like   and Beauty Heroes research brands and have a section on their sites outlining what they require of the products they consider to be clean.

I am especially keen on Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE: UNP) Canadian Pacific Railway Limited (NYSE: CP) and CSX Corporation (NASDAQ: CSX) three giants in the industry whose enormous scale and critical operations are set to keep generating strong cash flows moving forward.

Why Railroad Giants Are Ideal Right Now

Many investors fear that the macroeconomic turmoil of 2022 will persist into 2023 which could mean more downside for stocks. Railroad giants however can be ideal investments in the current market environment due to their unique attributes which could provide a margin of safety in the face of elevated uncertainty.

Stable and Predictable Revenue Streams

Railroads especially those operated by three major players in the industry are used to transport a broad range of goods covering long distances. Many of these goods including coal oil and agricultural products are necessities and generally remain in high demand in all economic scenarios.

This is especially true today as commodities such as grain and coal whose supply was disputed due to the war in Ukraine cover longer transportation routes and are in higher demand than the previous years.

Another factor that contributes to railroad giants producing predictable revenues is the fact that they remain the most scalable and efficient operators against any alternative solution. When it comes to being able to move enormous volumes of goods over long distances at the lowest cost per unit possible railroads beat other forms of transportation such as trucking by a wide margin.

Finally railroads often sign long-term agreements with their clients helping railroad companies enjoy predictable revenue streams.

Strong Moats Reduce Uncertainty

Another point to make for railroad operators is that they feature strong moats which translate to essentially no competition in their respective markets lowering their risk.

The competitive advantage comes from the fact that the railroad industry has some of the highest barriers to entry among any other industry. Developing and operating a railroad is a complicated and costly procedure. It demands massive capital expenditures to construct tracks bridges and tunnels as well as to buy or lease locomotives and railcars. Thus it would be nearly impossible for an up-and-coming competitor to compete with an established giant in the industry.

As if this wasn’t a good enough barrier to entry railroads must also obtain government approval and obtain rights-of-way to operate. Following a recession it’s common for new competitors to arise across multiple industries. If one were to occur this year you don’t have to worry about such a scenario as an investor in the railroad industry.

They Focus on Creating Shareholder Value

Finally I like railroad giants during uncertain environments due to the consistent focus they have shown on creating shareholder value even during recessionary periods. Canadian National Railway and CSX Corporation for instance have grown their dividends annually over the past 27 and 17 years respectively. In addition between 2014 and 2021 (just before the merger with KCS) Canadian Pacific went on to repurchase about 1/4 of its outstanding shares.

Their oligopolistic business models and lack of fear of potential competition should allow all three companies to grow and operate in a predictable manner. Therefore I believe that UNP CP and CSX will continue to keep focusing on how to maximize shareholder value even if market conditions in 2023 are not optimal.

What are the Price Targets for UNP CP and CSX Shares?

Turning to Wall Street Union Pacific has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on nine Buys eight Holds and one Sell assigned in the past three months. At $216.72 the average Union Pacific stock forecast suggests 4.7% upside potential.

When it comes to Canadian Pacific the stock also has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on nine Buys and six Holds assigned in the past three months. At $83.56 the average Canadian Pacific stock forecast suggests 12% upside potential.

Finally CSX has drawn a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys three Holds and one Sell assigned in the past three months. At $33.41 the average CSX stock forecast suggests 7.8% upside potential.

Takeaway – Boring but Reliable Investments

Railroad stocks are boring investments that won’t make you rich overnight. Their growth is usually slow and limited by the growth of the overall economy as the existing railroad giants are already ultra-mature and established businesses.

Nevertheless they are able to create shareholder value steadily due to their unique qualities which protect them from multiple risks that other industries are occasionally threatened by. If uneasiness in the markets persists through 2023 these qualities are likely to be appreciated which could result in investors flocking to railroad stocks.

So whether you are buying railroad stocks for their long-term prospects or as a less risky investment through 2023 I believe Union Pacific Canadian Pacific Railway and CSX are likely to serve you well as we advance.

Earlier this year COOP launched a telematics program that enables select trucks and trailer owners to get paid in real time on the revenue earned by their unit while rented.

CCJ Innovators profiles carriers and fleets that have found innovative ways to overcome trucking’s challenges. If you know a carrier that has displayed innovation contact CCJ Chief Editor Jason Cannon at [email protected] or 800-633-5953.

An ongoing challenge Ryder (CCJ Top 250 No. 14) and thousands of fleets across the country battle is idle equipment.

Ryder let that common problem serve as unifying call to action when they launched their vehicle sharing platform COOP in 2018.

Now a dedicated website and app has become so popular that COOP has seen 250% year-over-year growth since rolling out four years ago.

Their growing online presence which Ryder likens to Airbnb is not only helping Ryder itself to rent more of its equipment it’s also helping more than 10000 fleets across the country generate revenue from trucks trailers and vans that otherwise would be sitting around unused.

Ryder COOP “I'm getting revenue on assets that basically sit for six months” said Cliff Riegler fleet manager at Home City Ice based in Cincinnati Ohio. “It’s a big deal. We’re not talking chump change. We’re getting a negotiated number that Ryder gives and I think they’re very fair on the daily rates we get. I’m not going to complain at all.”

As Riegler puts it the ice business “is extremely seasonal.” In addition to renting out 16- and 18-foot reefer trucks during the fall and winter off-season he turned to COOP this past summer during peak ice demand to rent “somewhere around 50 units over the course of the summer from various locations.”

COOP customer Phil Sneed president of Sneed Leasing in Austin Texas said COOP has helped put more of his 53-foot dry van trailers to work.

“Our asset utilization rate increased from 76% to 98% thanks to the COOP mobile app” Sneed said.

Backhaul Direct based in Indianapolis earned more than $300000 renting out trailers during its first year with COOP.

“In our experience the platform’s ease and flexibility has enabled us to reduce vehicle downtime and in turn earn a profit to offset costs” said Backhaul Director CEO Greg Harris. “Since joining COOP we’ve been able to keep our fleet moving and create long-lasting relationships with businesses and renters in need of vehicles.”

In something akin to the old adage of “a rising tide lifts all boats” the growing popularity of COOP’s web and app presence has benefitted Ryder too.

“COOP works hand-in-hand with Ryder to help maximize vehicle utilization and facilitate asset repositioning which helps generate additional revenue across multiple Ryder divisions” said Romain Rousseau vice-president of COOP.

COOP’s success led Ryder to announce last week a drop-and-hook trailer service to complement its growing freight brokerage business. Shippers and carriers now have access to more than 6000 dry and refrigerated trailers available through COOP.

Strength in numbers

For fleets that lack the resources to shift gears and rent idle equipment turning to a major leasing company like Ryder makes for an easy transition.

COOP eliminates many of the major friction points associated with a peer-to-peer sharing network like insurance DOT compliance and payments. COOP also offers Ryder’s 24/7 Roadside Assistance.

“They're the intermediary in the process that gives me a lot of comfort in renting the trucks” Riegler said.

With over 1100 trucks in his fleet for Riegler it’s just a matter of submitting truck specs and photos to COOP which in turn posts the truck for rent on its website and app. Riegler gets a notification when someone signs up to rent. Renters that show up to a Home City Ice location to rent a truck are vetted by Ryder which gives Riegler additional peace of mind.

Riegler has rented out his trucks in the past but Ryder’s depth of experience and large line-up of resources that stem from managing nearly 239000 commercial vehicles made switching to COOP a no-brainer he said.

“I could rent these trucks on my own to various places and I have done that in the past but it was the maintenance piece that made it difficult for us” Riegler said.

Each Home City Ice location typically has one mechanic Riegler said who might be off for the weekends. That’s where Ryder’s 24/7 Roadside Assistance something that Riegler says is COOP’s “biggest advantage” comes into play.

“Ryder System has all that infrastructure in place so if truck goes down they call Ryder. Ryder handles the issue. They'll make a call to us. Do we approve it? Yes or no? I think just that piece alone has made this thing well worth the effort” Riegler said.

Bringing it all together

When it comes to attracting large volumes of equipment COOP is in the driver’s seat according to Rousseau.

“We're able to find the capacity regardless of the market conditions so that's a huge advantage” he said.

Technology created in-house with development partners is driven by “proprietary software and mobile application with the input of our many customers using the solution every day” Rousseau said.

If fleets don’t come to COOP COOP can seek them out and determine if they’re a good fit for the platform.

“COOP relies on advanced data analytics to determine the ideal customer profile and identify idle fleets based on industry seasonality” Rousseau said. “COOP also leverages its analytics platform to recommend daily rates and match vehicle owners with the best renting partners.”

Home City Ice Renters are charged a daily rental rate plus a mileage fee. COOP keeps 20% of the rental rate while the vehicle owner keeps 80%.

“Mileage is a pass through to the owner to cover running cost” Rousseau said.

Tire damage is usually covered by the renter while vehicle damage is covered by a physical damage policy renters are required to carry. Renters can use their own insurance or purchase insurance through COOP for a daily fee. Discounts are available for longterm rentals. COOP concentrates on renting Class 3 - 8 trucks and vans.

COOP reviews a vehicle’s inspection report to ensure it’s road-ready prior to making it available for rent. Companies interested in renting are also vetted.

“COOP checks the DOT record of every company before they are able to join platform” Rousseau said. “Companies with violations and/or low DOT scores do not qualify to rent.”

Differences in vehicle inventories help to keep COOP from competing with Ryder.

“COOP actually complements Ryder’s rental product” Rousseau said. “COOP offers equipment outside of our traditional rental footprint and also offers inventory that might not be available through our traditional rental locations such as trailers chassis and specialized equipment. COOP and Ryder Rental operate hand-in-hand to offer more options and value to our customers.”

Rousseau added that COOP is garnering longer rental commitments over Ryder’s traditional rental footprint.

“We are seeing longer term rentals on the COOP platform in part due to the fact that we drive a large volume of trailer rentals which have a tendency to stay out longer” he said.

Earlier this year COOP rolled out to all 50 states in mostly high density transportation markets. As the platform continues to grow Rousseau said their longterm goal is to continue to create a community of users who work in close proximity.

“We provide a nice piece of technology for people to just go get the equipment nearby without having to drive to a rental branch” Rousseau said. “Our goal at scale is to have enough vehicles listed on the platform so that there's always a vehicle nearby.”

Chelsea LGBTQ+ supporters group Chelsea Pride tweeted that they “totally condemn” the use of the homophobic slur after it was directed at Chelsea players during the match at Nottingham Forest’s City Ground stadium.

Nottingham Forest’s own LGBTQ+ supporters group wasted no time in tweeting that they were “embarrassed and ashamed” by the actions of their fellow fans adding in a separate tweet that the chant “makes us question how welcome we actually are at our own club”.

In a statement issued after the match Nottingham Forest FC said that the club “do not condone any type of discriminatory or offensive behaviour” and that the incident would be “fully investigated”.

The result may have finished in a one one draw our concern at Chelsea Pride is day 1 of 2023 & Homophobia plays it’s part at the city ground.



We stand with @LGBTQTrickies in condemning & calling this out.

It’s far from the first time ‘Chelsea rent boy’ has been heard from the stands: the chant has been used regularly in recent decades and last season Liverpool and Leeds and Tottenham football clubs all issued statements condemning its use by some of their supports.

In January 2022 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) confirmed that it would treat the “vile and disgusting” chant as a hate crime.

What is the ‘Chelsea rent boy’ chant and why is it homophobic?

‘Chelsea rent boy’ is a demeaning phrase directed at Chelsea players and supporters by opposition fans. Whether those using it know it or not the term has homophobic connotations that are intimately connected with Chelsea’s queer history.

A ‘rent boy’ is phrase used to describe a young male prostitute – specifically a male prostitute who sells sex to other men.

The term has been directed at Chelsea players and fans rather than other football teams because of the London borough of Chelsea’s past status as an LGBTQ+ hotspot.

During the 1960s and ’70s Chelsea was a hub for LGBTQ+ people in the West End of London boasting numerous pubs and bars where queer people could freely be themselves in a homophobic cultural climate.

The borough’s LGBTQ+ scene meant it developed a reputation for being a location where ‘rent boys’ would look to meet men for sex – specifically around Earl’s Court just minutes away from Chelsea FC’s Stamford Bridge football stadium.

Thus the chant ‘Chelsea rent boy’ is effectively a homophobic insult that implies male Chelsea players and fans sell sex to other men.

Some of the motivation behind the chant has evolved in recent years meaning that some people using the term in 2023 do not even realise its historically homophobic connotations.

After Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich brought Chelsea FC in 2003 and transformed the club’s fortunes by investing millions in the club many opposition fans began to use the chant to mock Chelsea players for being ‘bought’. But regardless of the motivation the homophobic undertone of using ‘rent boy’ as an insult to imply someone has paid sex with another man remains.

After Sunday’s incident at City Ground LGBTQ+ Trickies took aim at “uneducated” people who still use the chant.

#NFFC We’re tired of trying to explain to the uneducated why the chant is wrong on all levels we’re not tired of fighting for equality and inclusion. We have a problem and an issue when our own fans think this type of chant is acceptable and it makes us question how welcome — LGBTQ+ Trickies (@LGBTQTrickies) January 1 2023

“We’re tired of trying to explain to the uneducated why the chant is wrong on all levels we’re not tired of fighting for equality and inclusion” the group wrote on Twitter.

“We have a problem and an issue when our own fans think this type of chant is acceptable and it makes us question how welcome we actually are at our own club.”

Yes using the ‘Chelsea rent boy’ chant is now a hate crime

Last year the Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that it considers the term ‘rent boy’ to be a homophobic slur meaning that those using it could be liable for prosecution under hate crime laws.

A CPS spokesperson told Sky Sports News: “The CPS continues to take racist and homophobic chanting at football matches extremely seriously and is working closely the FA football clubs and charities to drive this hideous behaviour out of the game.

“The impact on groups attacked by this type of mob behaviour can be devastating. We will not hesitate to prosecute anyone accused of these actions where there is sufficient evidence to do so.”

Chelsea FC praised the move at the time writing on its official website: “Chelsea Football Club welcomes the news that the Crown Prosecution Service recognises that the term ‘rent boy’ is a homophobic slur and that those who use it are liable to prosecution.

“We will continue to work with our supporters and our LGBTQ+ fan group Chelsea Pride to ensure that our club is welcoming and inclusive for all and we will not hesitate to take action against anyone who persists in using this or any other discriminatory language including working with the police and CPS to secure prosecutions.”

What is being done to stop the use of the ‘Chelsea rent boy’ chant?

Ultimately it is the police who are responsible for enforcing the law around racist and homophobic language in football rather than the Football Association (FA).

Groups like Kick It Out and campaigns like Rainbow Laces are working to educate fans and eradicate homophobia in football but after Sunday’s incident Chelsea Pride have called on footballing authorities to do more to tackle homophobic chants and abuse.

Following the Homophobic Chanting at The City Ground yesterday we call out the Football authorities @FA to take serious action and update their own rule books. Enough is Enough. #NoToHate | #LGBTQ+ | #NotBanter pic.twitter.com/hL1gCzmYU4 — Chelsea Pride ⭐️⭐️🏆 (@ChelseaPride_) January 2 2023

In a statement shared on Twitter the group wrote: “We challenge the football authorities to now change their stance and start to hold clubs and football fans accountable for discriminatory language that’s being used within stadiums forwards the LGBTQ+ community.

“If the CPS are now taking this seriously then the FA needs to change its own rule books.”

The organisations added: “Discrimination has not place in football [sic]. We need to educate and change this behaviour. It’s not harmless banter. Just because it doesn’t offend you does not mean it’s not offending others.

“Our friends our allies want to see a change. We all do.”

An FA spokesperson later told The Mirror that the organisation was committed to ending the use of ‘rent boy’ in football.

“We strongly condemn the use of the term ‘rent boy’ and we are determined to drive it out of our game. We continue to work closely with the Crown Prosecution Service as well as the UK Football Policing Unit in relation to the use of this term” they said.

“Part of our work in this area has been to provide the relevant authorities with impact statements from LGBTQ+ supporters detailing how chants of this nature affects their experience and feeling of inclusion at football matches so that a clearer stance and understanding on the chant can be established.

“We stand firmly against all forms of discrimination and we are striving to ensure our game is a safe environment for all which truly embraces diversity and challenges hateful conduct both on and off the pitch.”

The nation’s efforts to complete this task ahead of schedule were praised by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji who also noted that these centres would make it simple for people to access and use primary healthcare services nationwide.

Union Minister for Health & Family Welfare Dr Mansukh Mandaviya congratulated the country on its success and said that India had accomplished its objective for itself. The combined and cooperative efforts of States/UTs and the Central Government have propelled India into a global model for guaranteed comprehensive primary health care services turning Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi ji’s vision into reality.

With the goal of “Antyodaya”—leaving no one behind—150000 Ayushman Bharat Health and Wellness Centers (AB-HWCs) are revolutionising the provision of comprehensive primary healthcare services that are universally free and cater to all age groups from birth to death through a continuum of care approach. AB-HWCs have reached 8.5 teleconsultations via e-Sanjeevni where approximately 4 lakh teleconsultations take place on a daily basis as part of their efforts to ensure that healthcare services are accessible to the country’s most remote areas.

In total over 86.90 crore beneficiaries have had non-communicable disease screenings including 29.9 crores for hypertension 25.56 crores for diabetes 17.44 crores for oral cancer 8.27 crores for breast cancer and 5.66 crores for cervical cancer.

Due to the growth of AB-HWCs there are now 172 essential medications available at Primary Health Centres – Health Wellness Centres (PHC-HWC) and 105 at Sub Health Centres – Health Wellness Centres (SHC-HWC) and there are now 63 and 14 essential diagnostics available at PHC-HWC and SHC-HWC respectively. In order to instill a mindset for community well-being AB-HWCs also include wellness classes on Yoga Zumba cyclathons and walkathons. They also offer suggestions on food physical activity positive parenting tobacco and alcohol cessation among other things.

These facilities have hosted more than 1.60 billion wellness sessions till date.

As part of the Urban Primary Health Centre-Health and Wellness Centre (UPHC-HWC) initiative AB-HWCs has operationalised two to three facilities in urban areas enhancing outpatient treatment and serving a population of 15000 to 20000.

In a joint statement from DOH and PhilHealth on Monday the department said that they are aware of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s decision to stop the increase of PhilHealth members’ contribution from four percent to 4.5 percent as it is meant to help people cope with the rising prices of goods.

Marcos ordered the postponement through a memorandum sent to Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire officer-in-charge of the DOH.

“The Department of Health and PhilHealth are cognizant of the decision of the Office of the President to suspend implementation of the Premium Contribution Increase of PhilHealth from 4% to 4.5% for the year 2023” the agencies said.

“The DOH and PhilHealth recognize the suspension is intended to help our kababayans cope with the increasing prices of commodities caused by inflation. Such moratorium in increases in premium contributions have been done in years 2020 and 2021. This was in accordance with directives of the Office of the President and in recognition of the effects of the pandemic during those years” it added.

In 2021 then president Rodrigo Duterte postponed PhilHealth’s proposed premium hike amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

According to DOH the premium hike was supposed to be for the purpose of financing the expanded benefits stated under the Universal Health Care law.

“The Premium Contributions collected by PhilHealth are for purposes of financing the expansion of benefits in accordance to the Universal Health Care law. Changes in premium schedules will also be synched with planned benefit roll-outs” DOH and PhilHealth said.

“The matter shall be discussed in the PhilHealth Board Meeting scheduled on Wednesday January 4 2023. Further announcements shall be made by the PhilHealth to properly guide the members and employers on the matter” they added.

In the memorandum signed by Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin on behalf of the President a deferral of the scheduled hike was ordered as the country is still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic.

PhilHealth initially claimed that the increase would be key to securing the future of the state-owned insurer.

De hecho esta es la segunda vez desde 1991 que las ventas de vinilo superan la marca de los 2 millones; la primera vez que esto sucedió fue solo el año pasado cuando se vendieron 21 millones de discos en la semana que finalizó el 23 de diciembre de 2021.

En la semana anterior a la Navidad las ventas de vinilos crecieron casi un 50 % con respecto a la semana anterior muy probablemente impulsadas por la gente que compraba regalos de Navidad. Esa semana el disco más vendido fue Midnights de Taylor Swift que movió 68.000 unidades.

El vinilo representó el 57 por ciento de las ventas totales de álbumes en los EE. UU. en esa semana y el 63 por ciento de todas las ventas de álbumes físicos.

“Es un momento decisivo para toda la industria de la música” dijo a The Guardian Kim Bayley director ejecutivo de la Asociación de Minoristas de Entretenimiento (ERA). “Después de que apareció el CD y prácticamente acabó con el negocio del vinilo pocos de nosotros habríamos creído que un renacimiento como este era posible”.

It’s fun and convenient to watch videos from your phone or tablet but getting those same quality visuals on your big-screen TV is even better.

Wondering what TV smartphone and plans deals are going on at Verizon? Visit our deals page to shop the latest.

Here are 2 simple ways to start streaming videos and more from your phone on your TV:

1. Plug in with a USB data cable.

Nearly all smartphones and tablets can plug into a TV’s USB port using a USB cable like this 6-foot Data Cable for USB-A to USB-C. Once connected you can project your phone’s display onto your TV – whether you’re checking out pictures watching videos surfing the web using apps or playing games. All it takes is one cable so there’s no need to connect via Wi-Fi or remember any passwords.

If you’re an Apple user you can also purchase a Lightning to USB-A cable to plug you iPhone or other Apple Lightning-compatible device up to your TV’s USB-C port.

2. Use Google Chromecast with Google TV.

If cords aren’t your thing try a gadget that plugs into your TV connects to Wi-Fi and communicates between your phone and the big screen. Google’s Chromecast with Google TV lets you play video in up to 4K HDR resolution. It plugs into a TV’s HDMI port and connects via your existing Wi-Fi so you can stream movies music and games from your smartphone tablet and other connected devices.

Chromecast with Google TV works with iOS and Android phones so you can stream no matter which smartphone you have. Use your phone like a remote control to skip content pause or rewind your favorite scene. Or go completely hands-free and connect your entire home eco-system with other Google products like the Google Nest Hub (2nd Generation).

3. Connect via your smart TV.

Already own an iOS device? Stream music videos photos and games right to your TV using AirPlay.* It’s compatible with popular Apple tablets and smartphones including the latest iPhone and iPad generations. The AirPlay icon is accessible from a number of apps and allows you to connect to your Apple TV via Wi-Fi. Simplified controls make it easy to zoom pause and switch viewing modes while you’re connected to the big screen.

Alternatively Samsung Smart TV owners can view content from their connected devices using Smart View. Available on Google Play the App Store and Samsung Galaxy Apps it turns your smartphone into a remote for an easy way to manage your screen. Connect your devices all in one place and create personalized playlists for your favorite videos pictures and music. Like AirPlay Samsung Smart View connects your devices to your smart TV using your existing Wi-Fi network.

Big screen big entertainment.

Your phone keeps you connected with all of the latest media. And with these 3 different methods to choose from you can find a quick and easy way to enjoy that media from the comfort of your own TV.

That's about three years later than the timeline the operator initially laid out.

A top Verizon executive told Mobile World Live this week that the operator expects to complete its 3G network shutdown by January 1 2023. Verizon spokesperson Kevin King told Light Reading that's the ""absolute last possible date"" for the shutdown. He said the operator continues to work to move customers off its 3G network and has been reallocating that spectrum for 5G and other technologies as it gets customers off 3G.

""We're actively moving folks off the network and decommissioning it as we go"" he said.

Moving target

The 2023 date is the latest from Verizon.

In 2016 Verizon said it planned to shutter its 3G network on December 31 2019. The carrier in July 2018 confirmed it stopped activating 3G phones. Verizon then reiterated its 3G shutdown plans to Light Reading at the beginning of 2019. But then in July 2019 Verizon spokesperson Howie Waterman confirmed to Light Reading that the operator had delayed the shuttering of its 3G network from the end of 2019 to the end of 2020.

In January 2021 Verizon spokesperson Kevin King told Light Reading that ""our 3G network is operational and we don't have a plan to shut it down at this time. We'll work with customers to move them to newer technology.""

However King subsequently clarified to Light Reading that ""the network is still going to be shut down. But we're working with customers to migrate them to 4G and want to make sure we continue to care for them."" He said on January 5 2021 that Verizon did not have a final ""cut off date.""

Now though it appears Verizon does: At the end of next year.

The owner of a Bartow-based farm labor company was sentenced to 118 months in prison on Thursday for leading a conspiracy that trapped Mexican agricultural workers into forced labor in the U.S. between 2015 and 2017.

Bladimir Moreno 55 the owner of Los Villatoros Harvesting LLC at 8331 Alturas Road in Bartow the labor contracting company that employed the workers was charged in September 2021 and pleaded guilty earlier this year to conspiracy under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and conspiracy to commit forced labor. U.S. District Court Judge Charlene Edward Honeywell of the Middle District of Florida sentenced Moreno to 118 months in prison with three years of supervised release and ordered him to pay more than $175000 in restitution to the victims.

Two of Moreno’s co-defendants previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy under RICO and a third Guadalupe Mendes 45 pleaded guilty to conspiring to obstruct a federal investigation. They were sentenced in October.

Efrain Cabrera Rodas a citizen of Mexico who worked for LVH as a recruiter manager and supervisor received 41 months in prison. Christina Gamez a U.S. citizen who worked for LVH as a bookkeeper manager and supervisor received 37 months in prison. Mendes a U.S. citizen who worked for LVH as a manager and supervisor received eight months of home detention and a $5500 fine to be paid over 24 months of supervised release.

According to court documents Moreno's farm labor contracting company brought large numbers of temporary seasonal Mexican workers into the United States on H-2A agricultural visas and compelled them to work in Florida Kentucky Indiana Georgia and North Carolina. Authorities also said he engaged in a pattern of other racketeering activity that included visa fraud and fraud in foreign labor contracting among other things.

In order to facilitate the enterprise Moreno made false statements in applications to federal agencies for the company to be granted temporary H-2A agricultural workers according to the Department of Justice. Moreno and his co-conspirators also made false promises to the Mexican workers to encourage them to work for LVH and then charged them inflated sums to come into the United States on H-2A visas authorities said.

Once the immigrants arrived in the United States Moreno and his co-conspirators coerced more than a dozen of them into providing long hours of agricultural labor six to seven days a week for low pay the Justice Department said. Moreno and his co-conspirators used various forms of coercion including imposing debts on the workers; confiscating their passports; subjecting them to crowded unsanitary and degrading living conditions; harboring them in the United States after their visas had expired; and threatening them with arrest and deportation if they failed to comply with Moreno’s and his co-conspirators’ demands authorities said.

Later when the enterprise was under investigation Moreno created and provided to investigators fraudulent records that contained falsified information about the workers’ pay and hours and repeatedly made false statements to federal investigators.

“Human trafficking including forced-labor campaigns that exploit vulnerable workers is unlawful immoral and inhumane” Kristen Clarke assistant attorney general of the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division said in a news release. “This defendant abused his power as a business owner to capitalize on the victims’ vulnerabilities and immigration status luring those seeking a better quality of life with false promises of lawful work paying a fair wage. The defendant forced Mexican agricultural workers to labor under inhumane conditions confiscated their passports imposed exorbitant fees and debts and threatened them with deportation or false arrest. The Department of Justice is committed to seeking justice for survivors of forced labor campaigns holding perpetrators accountable and stripping wrongdoers of their illegal profits.”

Walmart (WMT 0.07%) and Target (TGT -0.72%) have a theft problem. In recent months the big box retailers have been complaining about an increase in ""shrinkage"" a retail industry term for when in-store stock is lower than what's accounted for in the books. In other words people walking out of the store with unpaid inventory is on the rise. Even commerce software company Shopify (SHOP -5.62%) has a frequently visited webpage explaining ""shrinkage"" how it's on the rise and how small retailers can combat the problem. Shopify estimates it was a $61 billion-a-year loss for the retail space a few years ago but that figure has reportedly increased in 2022. Inflationary pressure on consumers is an oft-cited reason for this rise in theft.

Enter Nvidia (NVDA 1.27%) which believes it has solutions to help with retail shrinkage. Here's what investors need to know.

Shrinkage a top cause of shrinking profit margins

During their third-quarter 2022 earnings calls and post-earnings interviews Walmart Target and other retail executives explained how big a problem shrinkage has become. Target specifically said theft had an estimated $400 million impact on gross profit margin of merchandise sold through the first nine months of 2022.

Target is huge and sells tens of billions of dollars in merchandise every year but retailer profit margins are thin already -- low- to mid-single-digit operating profit margins are about the average. $400 million is a big deal when it's a full 2% of total gross profit year to date. For the full year of 2022 Target expects total shrinkage to rise to an estimated $600 million.

What's especially notable in this figure is that e-commerce accounts for upwards of 20% of Target's sales these days where shrinkage likely isn't as big a problem. Of course e-commerce (whether it's shipped to consumers' homes or ordered online for in-store pickup) has its own challenges affecting profit margins but it nonetheless makes the in-store theft problem that much more dramatic. On the Q3 2022 earnings call Target CEO Brian Cornell said the company is ""making significant investments in training and technology that can deter theft and keep our guests and store team members safe.""

Walmart similarly said it thinks it's losing about 2% to 3% of its merchandise value to theft this past year up from an estimated 0.7% to 1% annual loss before the pandemic. Walmart has said it's putting in measures like locking up more products behind glass and might raise prices to counter losses.

But locking up merchandise is inconvenient and increasing prices to counteract theft is unfair to those shoppers who aren't committing the crime. Some industry pundits also want online marketplaces like Amazon (AMZN -1.07%) and Meta's (META 0.16%) Facebook Marketplace to do more to crack down on the sale of stolen goods on their sites. But in a recent presentation on the future of AI Nvidia thinks it has better ideas.

The rise of artificially intelligent crime fighters

In Nvidia's 2023 AI Predictions blog post (a really interesting must-read primer on what AI is actually doing) vice president of Nvidia's AI for Retail segment Azita Martin mentioned shrinkage (as well as supply chain challenges but that's a different topic entirely). Martin specifically mentioned new challenges arising from contactless checkout options at brick-and-mortar stores. As the ease of walking out with unpaid products increases Nvidia has solutions like computer vision-enabled cameras that can spot theft paired with analytics that can recognize if an item being rung up at self-checkout is indeed the correct item purchased.

Nvidia has other retail solutions that help further automate the checkout experience so retailers can allocate employees to other tasks like restocking and store monitoring. Such technology could help stores like Walmart and Target fight theft and improve their profit margins. Of course purchasing and implementing new technology costs money. But given the size of the shrinkage problem Walmart and Target have been reporting this year making an up-front investment could lead to a dramatic improvement in the bottom line in subsequent years if they can keep better track of their inventory. Target's CEO commentary mentioned above seems to indicate they agree.

All of this speaks to how powerful a business Nvidia has become. Its AI platform now has specific use cases that span every sector of the economy not just video games where it got its start. In fact Nvidia is planning on providing further details on its largest revenue segment ""data centers"" starting with the Q4 fiscal 2023 update (for the three-month period that will end in January 2023). Data center end-markets hauled in over $3.8 billion in sales last quarter (nearly two-thirds of total revenue) and includes AI software used by industries of all types -- including retail.

Nvidia's technology could indeed help companies like Walmart and Target solve some of the most critical problems like theft they face today. And that could be a really great thing for both retail shareholders and Nvidia alike.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrcmcuY29tL21vYmlsZS1jb3VudHkvbW9iaWxlLXBvbGljZS1pZC13YWxtYXJ0LXNob290aW5nLXN1c3BlY3RzL9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrcmcuY29tL21vYmlsZS1jb3VudHkvbW9iaWxlLXBvbGljZS1pZC13YWxtYXJ0LXNob290aW5nLXN1c3BlY3RzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,One of three suspects in Walmart shooting arrested by Mobile Police,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 429 Client Error: Unknown Error for url: https://www.wkrg.com/mobile-county/mobile-police-id-walmart-shooting-suspects/ on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiTmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrcmcuY29tL21vYmlsZS1jb3VudHkvbW9iaWxlLXBvbGljZS1pZC13YWxtYXJ0LXNob290aW5nLXN1c3BlY3RzL9IBUmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LndrcmcuY29tL21vYmlsZS1jb3VudHkvbW9iaWxlLXBvbGljZS1pZC13YWxtYXJ0LXNob290aW5nLXN1c3BlY3RzL2FtcC8?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen

This role allows Chris to support the creation of shows and movies we love as they enter the post-production and editing phases. An alumnus of Morgan State University Chris still carries and utilizes skills and lessons from his time at the Historically Black College and University (HBCU). Through Disney on the Yard Chris has the opportunity to impact and serve others by aiding HBCU students achieve their career goals with Disney.

What HBCU did you attend? I went to Morgan State University and studied information systems.

What segment of the company do you currently work for? The Walt Disney Company (Corporate)

Current Job Title: Manager Filmmaker Services

Describe your role.

You can think of me as a client service liaison between the studio and any production that utilizes Disney post-production editorial spaces theaters screening rooms and automated dialogue replacement (ADR) work on the Burbank lot.

What is your favorite project that you’ve worked on?

Our team’s involvement with “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever”

Our team’s involvement in each production we work on includes finding suitable editorial space for the post production team to continue working on the film. Editorial space means the rooms where the filmmakers create and edit editorial and visual effects material. We also help facilitate any ADR needs needed for the project here on the iconic Stage B (ADR stage). Our team helps provide and facilitate the screening rooms and theaters for the filmmaker to view material while in the editorial process.

For “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever” our team was involved in the initial post-production process. We were fortunate enough to support the first “Black Panther” for their entire post-production process here on the lot as well.

Have you held other roles at Disney? If so describe your Disney journey.

I initially started here as a supervisor of health and safety working alongside my current Disney Digital Studio Services (DDSS) team. My previous position was responsible for ensuring our studios (Burbank and Pico) and editorial spaces and personnel met and adhered to COVID return to work requirements. After working a year in my previous role I was offered my current position with filmmaker services within DDSS.

What was your favorite part about attending an HBCU?

I loved the camaraderie and the natural feeling of belonging. The historical roots and foundation provided by an HBCU are unmatched. Though I only attended Morgan State for one year before enlisting in the Air Force as an Air Traffic Controller my HBCU experience will never be forgotten and serves as a pillar for my professional makeup to this day.

What does Disney on the Yard mean to you?

Disney on the Yard represents opportunity and a sense of welcomed belonging not only for the students but also for Disney employees. It’s my goal to be a bridge for any student who desires to work here at the company. Disney on the Yard provides me with an amazing opportunity to do so through its mentoring and public speaking opportunities. It was through Disney on the Yard that I was introduced to another great mentoring opportunity with DEI which helps place minorities in the film and television industries. Disney on the Yard also provides me with the comfort of knowing that I’m truly making a difference in the lives of others. I always look forward to supporting Disney on the Yard in any way I can!

But they also know I’ve come to hate Disney creator of the world’s most popular amusement parks with the passion of a thousand suns.

Here’s what I wrote about the Disney parks earlier this year:

The thing I find least interesting about Disney by far is the company’s penchant for having a hit — and then exploiting it over and over and over in a zillion different incarnations until whatever was enjoyable or interesting about the hit has long since been obliterated.

I also wrote:

[With their new ticket prices and app add-ons Disney has created] two different park experiences: one for the rich who can pay to bypass the endless soul-crushing lines and a different much worse experience for everyone else.

While in the Netherlands recently my husband Michael and I visited Efteling which is the second most-visited theme park in Europe after Disneyland Paris.

It turned out to be everything Disney used to be.

In fact Efteling has a bit of a relationship with the Disney company. There’s a rumor that Walt Disney visited Efteling which opened in 1952 while he was planning the original Disneyland which opened in 1955.

That rumor probably isn’t true but when the Disney corporation was planning Disneyland Paris which opened in 1992 they definitely consulted with the folks at Efteling for tips on how to appeal to European audiences.

And when Efteling began introducing higher-tech rides like Symbolica which opened in 2017 at a cost of €35 million they consulted with the experts at Disney. I don’t speak Dutch and I didn’t know the story that Symbolica is based on so the ride made absolutely no sense whatsoever to me. But it looks fantastic.

(I’ve since learned the story involves a visit to the king’s palace and a jester named Pardoes – Efteling’s mascot – shows you all the hidden parts of the castle.)

Whatever the truth about Efteling’s former relationship with Disney it’s past time for the folks at Disney to consult with Efteling again because they could learn a lot.

These days the Disney parks are crazy expensive and most of their future plans involve leaning hard into wildly over-exposed franchises like Frozen and the Marvel properties. As for the crowds well the new-ish Flight of Passage ride at Disney’s Animal Kingdom was built to accommodate lines of up to six hours.

Meanwhile Efteling is still well fun.

First compared to Disney the crowds are very manageable. It helps that the park is twice the size of the original Disneyland in California yet gets only five million visitors a year – compared to 19 million for Disneyland in Florida or 20 million for Disney World’s Magic Kingdom.

Meanwhile much of Efteling is also still forest which is soothing and lovely.

Admission is €41 per day (or around $43 USD) compared to the Disney parks which use dynamic pricing but are now generally somewhere between $125 to $189 a day which blows my mind just to type.

Better still while Efteling has “single-rider” lines on many attractions there is no pure-evil process by which rich people are able to pay more money to avoid the lines.

How’s the park itself?

As with many older parks Efteling began modestly with something called the Fairy Tale Forest. This part of the park still exists though in a greatly updated form.

The park has since expanded into different “realms”: Reizenrijk (or Travel) Marerijk (or Fairy) Ruigrijk (or Adventure) Anderrijk (or Other). In 2017 the center of the park officially became the Fantasierijk (or Fantasy) realm and it includes a pretty spectacular light water and music show that even includes bursts of real fire.

The premier rides are mostly top-notch but I especially enjoyed the Flying Dutchman which starts out as a Pirates of the Caribbean-like dark ride including pirate themes but then halfway through it turns into a steel roller-coaster that ends up splashing down in the nearby lagoon.

The ride’s most ingenious aspect may be the fact that despite an impressive splash-down none of the riders actually get wet – something that was greatly appreciated in the cold November weather of our visit.

There are four other coasters: one wooden two steel and one indoor. The indoor one Vogel Rok is a jerky bust although it has a cool theme involving the giant “rocs” of legend.

But the single best ride in the park is probably the Baron 1898 coaster which tells the story of a cursed gold mine and involves a plunge down into a “mineshaft.” In reality the ride is a rare “dive coaster” and includes an impressive near-vertical drop of almost forty meters into a smoke-filled pit.

The park also includes Piraña which is a more traditional “splash” ride. When it opened in 1982 it was Europe’s very first river rapids ride and its ancient Mayan temple design still looks impressive. But it was clear from a glance that riders get soaked on this ride and so given the November chill we stayed far away.

The other top dark ride is Fata Morgana which is a Pirates of the Caribbean-like experience inspired by 1001 Nights and an over-the-top celebration of Arabian culture. Like the Disney pirate ride it’s older – and a bit dated in its animatronic technology. But unlike the Disney ride the sensibility doesn’t look to have been updated either so its gender and cultural stereotypes are definitely somewhat outdated and offensive.

One of the park’s most famous attractions isn’t a ride at all – it’s the trash cans which are built in the shape of a character from a Dutch nursery rhyme Holle Bolle Gijs who never stops eating. All around the park he calls out “Papier hier! Papier hier!” which means “Paper here!” And when you put trash in his mouth it’s sucked away by a vacuum and the character makes a very satisfying gobbling sound.

One attraction you definitely won’t see in a Disney park is based on another Dutch fairy tale about a donkey that poops gold coins. The Donkey Lift Your Tail donkey in the Fairy Tale Forest doesn’t literally poop gold but if you feed it a coin it will poop out a souvenir fake-gold coin.

The truth is Efteling isn’t as slick as the Disney parks and the best rides here aren’t quite as state-of-the-art as the top Disney attractions.

But Efteling restored my faith in amusement parks anyway in part because I wasn’t surrounded by hordes of people and I didn’t feel like I was being fleeced at every turn.

I also never felt like I was part of some grand corporate strategy designed to suck me and my money into some vast but increasingly bland media ecosystem.

No the point was simply to be interesting imaginative and fun.

And I had fun – a lot of it.

Disney could learn a lot which is sad because Efteling really is exactly what Disney used to be.

Discovery restructure 12-year deal,"Deals like records apparently are meant to be broken — or at least restructured — as the PGA Tour and Warner Bros. Discovery announced a restructured international media rights agreement on Monday.

As first reported by Sports Illustrated the entities notified their media partners that beginning in 2023 PGA Tour content will continue to be distributed via Discovery+ or Eurosport but will return rights to Africa Asia Australia New Zealand and areas in Europe and Latin America not receiving Discovery+ or Eurosport.

While new terms of the restructured deal were not disclosed the news comes nearly one-third of the way into the 12-year $2 billion agreement that was announced in 2018. The intent then was to build a direct-to-consumer platform with the launch of GolfTV. Two months ago though GolfTV was shuttered.

""Together we agreed restructuring the management of future international rights was a logical step given the changes under the partnership driven by a broader evolution in the media sector and changing consumer consumption habits as the focus shifts from niche services such as GolfTV to broader and scaled streaming offerings"" the PGA Tour said in a statement. ""Our main goal was providing zero disruption to the fan experience in 2023 which was accomplished.""

On April 8 WarnerMedia and Discovery finalized a merger and on April 23 Warner Bros. Discovery stock closed at $26. But according to a Dec. 6 CNBC.com report CEO David Zaslav “determined the company was a mess.” It was reported that Warner Bros. Discovery’s total debt was about $50 tens of billions more than the company’s market capitalization. The company’s stock closed 2022 at $9.48.

""As consumer behavior changed so did Warner Bros. Discovery’s own business; focusing more on scaled broad entertainment propositions rather than single sport or 'view and do' products"" Warner Bros. Discovery said in a statement. ""In an evolving media landscape we have found that including sport within a broader consumer offer provides greater value to subscribers and their wider household as well as opening up sports to an even bigger audience.""",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiW2h0dHBzOi8vYmxlZWRpbmdjb29sLmNvbS90di9sb29uZXktdHVuZXMtd2FybmVyLWJyb3MtZGlzY292ZXJ5LXNob3J0cy1yZXR1cm5pbmctdG8taGJvLW1heC_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Looney Tunes/Warner Bros.

Terrill “Ya Fav Trashman” Haigler who worked for 14 months during the height of the pandemic as a Philadelphia sanitation worker spent much of his tenure pointing out to the media and city officials the neighborhoods where garbage was piling up in the streets.

With a website and outreach to local news outlets Haigler shone a spotlight on mounds of trash and the plight of garbage workers. He partnered with local elected officials and gathered an army of volunteers for cleanup. He also raised more than $30000 to buy personal protective equipment for workers.

In Philadelphia and across the nation the pandemic has exposed all the problems with trash pickup. In many places refuse went uncollected as workers got sick or struggled with getting personal protective equipment and garbage in residential neighborhoods piled up from people working from home. New trucks got caught in supply chain snarls.

Now local jurisdictions still face trash problems that surfaced during the pandemic and are exacerbated by inflation and a scarce workforce. Cities are having to increase wages and add bonuses to attract and keep sanitation workers. Landfill tipping fees have gone up and there’s still a higher percentage of trash accumulating in residential areas than there was before the pandemic began because more people are working from home at least part of the time.

The challenges have led to higher costs for cities and counties and efforts to increase or shift budgets to cope are having mixed success.

The Memphis City Council held a meeting in July to address trash issues. Jacksonville Florida talked in January about paying residents back for uncollected trash though officials eventually decided against it. Mounds of overflowing trash in New York City have dampened Mayor Eric Adams’ efforts to lure tourists back to the city. And thousands of complaints about St. Louis’ uncollected trash have set records in city hall.

In addition to its severe water problems Jackson Mississippi almost lost its trash collection service in a contract dispute that was finally settled in October after the company went without pay for six months.

“It clearly is a problem that has not abated” said Francis Ryan a labor history professor at Rutgers University in New Jersey who has studied sanitation workers and trash.

“When you walk down the streets of many big cities you are having to get off the sidewalks to walk in the streets because of trash” he said. “It’s a persistent problem that we are going to have to have really smart people try to resolve.”

If nothing else the restrictions and societal changes of COVID-19 have illuminated how essential sanitation workers are and how little they make said David Biderman executive director of the Solid Waste Association of North America a trade group.

“For a long time solid waste was undervalued by the public compared to schools and parks and other things that are often competitors for financial support in the budget” he said in a phone interview.

“People who worked in the garbage truck weren’t being paid as much as others. As a result of COVID there’s been a shift from government and public officials” he said. “These workers really are essential. We have to pay them a higher wage and have to attract new people to the industry. In 2022 things are significantly better than they were during the peaks of the COVID pandemic in 2020 or 2021.”

“Ya Fav Trashman” Haigler drew some popularity from his online interviews and videos and got out of the trash collection business. He raised his profile so much that he became an influencer and started a nonprofit. He’s now a community organizer has written a children’s book about sanitation workers and is running for city council. But some of the attention he and others brought to trash apparently has paid off.

In Philadelphia on-time trash collection rates jumped from 56% in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 to 96% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 which started in September said Jolene Nieves Byzon communications director for the city controller’s office drawing the numbers from the quarterly city manager’s report.

In addition the city has increased the number of budgeted personnel who directly handle trash and collection from 960 to 1108 employees. She could not say how many positions are currently vacant.

Houston also has experienced trash chaos during the pandemic. The latest difficulty was a shortage of drivers earlier this year. The city offered $3000 bonuses to new hires given over time to encourage them to stay on the job. The city also upped salaries by 6% to a starting pay of $18.44 an hour according to a spokesperson for Houston’s Solid Waste Management Department.

Mark Wilfalk director of the department said that at the end of 2021 the city’s vacancy rate for trash drivers and workers was 16% and has now dropped to 14%. “That doesn’t sound like much” he acknowledged but he said it’s the difference from having nearly 60 openings to around 45.

“We have had some setbacks even with the recruiting effort” he said in a phone interview. “Sometimes people don’t work out.”

Other hurdles in Houston mirrored in other cities include higher tipping fees at landfills Wilfalk said and delays in receiving 19 new waste collection vehicles that were ordered before he got to Houston in November 2021. The trash trucks now are not scheduled to arrive before next August he said. “Services are delayed and customers feel it.”

In Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed a bill that would have increased annual fees for solid waste facilities such as landfills and indexed those fees to inflation despite overwhelming political support and a surprising endorsement by the private trash industry. The governor argued the higher fees would make it harder for companies to do business in Virginia especially since inflation has skyrocketed.

But Virginia state Sen. Scott Surovell a Democrat who sponsored the bill said the governor’s statement amounted to “total spin” — more about politics than policy. The previous Democratic administration had put together a group of interested parties including waste companies that would have had to pay the higher fees he said in a phone interview. “They came up with a fee structure they thought was fair. In the meantime the election happened.”

The issue of fairness in who pays for waste management came to a head in San Diego in a referendum in November that barely passed.

It will allow the city to start charging homeowners for trash pickup. The city council will set the amount later. Currently the city shoulders that burden through the general fund. One estimate showed it cost $173 million between 2017 and 2021 according to the Voice of San Diego.

Apartment dwellers however pay for private trash pickup under a hundred-year-old ordinance. The ballot measure was cast as an issue of fairness. New fees won’t take effect for a while however as studies need to be done before the city council can act said Michael Zucchet of the San Diego Municipal Employees Association which supported the measure.

Zucchet said that since about half of San Diego residents live in apartments or condos and half in single-family homes it’s not a surprise that the vote was close.

“In the California legislature they are passing a number of bills related to increased recycling services and composting services” he said. “Every other city would simply pass that along to households” but San Diego couldn’t do that without the new measure

Meredith Danberg-Ficarelli waste management expert and co-founder and CEO of WATS a waste administration software company said waste management infrastructure is just one of the many U.S. systems that are either broken or stumbling.

“Waste infrastructure in our country is as neglected as all our other infrastructure” she said in an interview. The pandemic revealed these insufficiencies she said and people began to focus on it. “Waste touches everything; that’s why it matters so much.”

In a move to place the circular economy at the core of economic decision-making and practice Rwanda has launched a 14-year Circular Economy Action Plan and Roadmap that needs $211.2 million to manage waste and adopt clean production technologies. The plan that includes 17 policy interventions and activities across priority sectors was launched on December 6 2022.

""We are not really the only one but among the first. Ghana has also developed a similar action plan that was presented during the World Circular Economy Forum (WCEF). Kenya has an Action Plan as well but limited to the plastic economy” Basile Uwimana communication and outreach specialist at the Ministry of Environment said.

The action plan that goes up to 2035 targets initiatives to ensure high-quality waste fractions high-quality reuse high-quality wastewater treatment recycling and recovery reduction of post-harvest losses as well as collaboration across the public and private sector academia and civil society for a circular economy.

It analyses key economic sectors including waste water agriculture textiles information and communication technology transport and construction.

In fact according to the Rwanda Compendium of Environmental Statistics by Rwanda Environment Management Authority solid waste generation is expected to rise by 14 per cent from 2020-2035.

However proper management is still relatively low according to the 5th National Household Survey released in 2018 by the National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda; households that live in modern or planned settlements tend to be equipped with better facilities for waste management and sewage treatment.

The findings of the survey show that the provision of refuse collection services in urban areas was 42 per cent and the use of compost heaps was 48 per cent in rural areas.

To ensure a smooth implementation experts suggest ownership from community level for people to avoid mixing wastes of different types that complicate a proper treatment like plastic with organic waste and textile for example. ""People need skills to sort waste before they are taken to landfills or for recycling. There are needs for government intervention to enhance awareness about waste sorting"" said Paulin Buregeya a waste management expert and chief executive of the Company for Protection of Environment and Development (COPED) engaged in waste collection in the city of Kigali.

For behaviour change awareness campaigns in cities and rural areas for better waste separation at source are planned for. A circular economy module is expected to be embedded in education curricula from primary school to university levels as well as vocational training courses. Furthermore over $24.2 million will be spent on development of national regulation to facilitate waste characterisation and treatment.

The rapid increase in Rwanda’s population and industrialisation is expected to intensify pressures on environmental social and ecological living that will eventually deplete natural resources.

A circular construction design guide is incorporated in the action plan to provide guidance on how to construct with more sustainable materials and in a way that enables the circular economy at the end-of-life of the construction materials and components.

“The take make consume and throw away approach to development cannot guarantee sustainable growth or well-being of our population. Circular economy on the other hand is about making better use of our resources and the benefits are immense. Reducing waste and greenhouse gas emissions halting biodiversity loss and shifting to genuine recycling promise a greener future for us all” said Jeanne d’Arc Mujawamariya Rwanda’s environment minister. “Rwanda’s commitment to circular economy is driven by our aspiration to foster socio-economic transformation while also conserving and protecting our environment.”

Highlighting how Rwanda is applying circular economy approaches with examples Minister Mujawamariya said that in waste management Rwanda was one of the first countries in the world to ban plastic bags and single use plastics and the second in Africa to establish a state-of-the-art e-waste dismantling and recycling facility. The country revised its environment and climate change policy to incorporate the circular economy and set up a public-private platform to advance it she added.

“While we are proud of the progress we have made we still have a long way to go to ensure a just and inclusive transition to a circular economy. That is why Rwanda developed this first-ever National Circular Economy Action Plan and Roadmap” Mujawamariya said.

But despite the progress made companies wishing to go green and circular are still faced with a lack of suitable financial tools and funding to support their businesses.

Africa’s future economic growth and the prosperity of its people are intimately linked to a successful transition to a green and resilient economy African Development Bank’s Rwanda Country Manager Aissa Touré Sarr said. “Investment in companies and ecosystems working on circular economy solutions has an opportunity to drive whole-of-society transformation and innovations.”

Rwanda’s Circular Economy Action Plan and Roadmap was launched at the opening day of the World Circular Economy Forum 2022 organised by the African Circular Economy Alliance and hosted by Rwanda from December 6-8 2022. The forum saw over 2000 business leaders policymakers and experts from around the world.

The Africa Circular Economy Alliance was established in 2017 during the 23rd Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change held at Bonn Germany by the governments of South Africa Nigeria and Rwanda. It aimed at encouraging Africa’s transition to a circular economy at the country regional and continental levels by operating as a collaborative platform to coordinate and link the various initiatives on the continent.

Among the three countries Rwanda is the only one that has developed a Circular Economy Action Plan and Roadmap.

Birkenhead has been promised billions of pounds of investment in the past as part of a grand masterplan for the town.

Years later people are starting to move into their first homes along the waterfront. Wirral Council believes Birkenhead is on the cusp of great change though some in the town still have reservations about whether that will become reality.

The plans include transforming Woodside Ferry terminal Hamilton Square the town centre and its famous market. A new park will also be created along a disused train line and promises of more than 23000 new homes.

One of the key parts of this “grand masterplan” is the Wirral Waters development on Birkenhead docks with developer Peel L&P looking to invest £4.5bn into the area. The first phase of the development involves development along East Float with several residential and commercial developments being built or in the process. This will see 1100 homes built including 100 affordable homes 20% cheaper than the current rates in Birkenhead.

Changes to the A554 have included new walkways trees and cycle paths. Despite concerns over a “confusing” junction there have been no accidents along the route. New Grade A office space has opened up for the first time in ten years with two thirds already occupied or under offer. While the developments haven’t been verified as net zero Peel L&P who are behind the development said sustainability is a core part of the project and has been rated excellent.

Over 30 years the developments hope to provide 13000 homes in the next 30 years as well as investment in business and research alongside improved public transport.

What changes will be seen next year?

People have already started to move into 30 homes including 15 “town houses” in Redbridge Quay off Dock Road. The houses sit right on the dock edge with views over the water. Behind them are flats with apple orchards and a small park next door.

Peel hopes to host a series of community events over the spring and the summer in the park to encourage people to visit the docks where large parts were previously not open to the public. The Edgerton Village area will also see cafes retail and more public space open up.

Richard Mawdsley Peel’s director of development for Wirral Waters said people could expect to see the MEA Park project in the West Float area delivered which will include new education facilities and a new government-funded Manufacturing Technology Centre.

70000ft of floor space will come as part of this project. He said: “That would be good news that would mean jobs for local people in this area well into the hundreds.”

People can also expect to see work begin soon in a proposed Maritime Knowledge Hub if approval is granted by Wirral Council. The hub will be based in the refurbished hydraulic tower that dominates the skyline.

Mr Mawdsley said: “That would be a massive signifier of progress on this side of the water if we can refurbish that building. A symbol of the renaissance of the east bank on the Wirral.”

It will be focused on decarbonising the maritime sector with academia based there as well as startup and industry organisations.

Developers are preparing to begin work on a new dementia care facility with accommodation for more than 100 people which Peel said could bring in 150 new jobs. The development will be next to Redbridge Quay with Peel aiming to create mixed neighbourhood in the area.

Cranes are also putting up the Millars Quay apartment blocks which will have 500 new apartments as part of a £130m investment with dockside walkways cycle routes and greenspace.

20% of these will be affordable and people are expected to be moving in by 2025.

What is happening after this?

Planning applications have been put in for 1800 homes as part of the Vittoria Studios developments as well as 56000 square feet of commercial space. These will be near Corporation Road on the south side of the docks.

Given there are plans for a large number of homes with few transport links next to some of the developments Peel said it was in discussions with the Liverpool City Region to develop transport links beyond walking and cycle routes.

Mr Mawdsley said: “They’re not too close. We have the ferry terminals and it is flat but if you live in Redbridge Quay you’ve got a 25 minute walk to the train station so on a wet and windy November night it’s not particularly pleasant.

“We need something like a feeder service and we are working with the council and the city region to solve that problem. We need to give people the choice of what to do and wean people out of the car.”

He added current discussions included an improved bus system and a light rail connection using existing infrastructure but that the focus for now is on delivering the projects on the north side.

Mr Mawdsley said: “Rome wasn’t built in a day so we need to be looking at individual projects and getting those off the ground and clustering those into neighbourhood areas and all the infrastructure.”

What does this mean for Birkenhead?

Some have reacted to the developments with an element of scepticism given previous regeneration promises for Birkenhead have stalled. Mr Mawdsley said: “All the hard work behind the scenes is starting to pay off. Seeing is believing and you come down here and you can see projects either built or being built.

“For me now it’s keeping that momentum going during the course of next year and the following years after. We’ve got our projects mapped out.

Once the developments are complete large areas of the dock side will be walkable with paths along the edge.

Mr Mawdsley said: “We need to make sure the project is permeable. At the moment the dock edge has been closed off to the people of Birkenhead Liscard and Seacombe.

“People haven’t been able to get to the dock edge. What we want to do is open it up a bit more so people realise what an asset there is on the doorstep.”

People have raised concerns about gentrification and whether the investment could push people out of Birkenhead. Mr Mawdsley said: “At the moment within the dock estate you don’t have many people living and working here.

“You have a lot of brownfield land which can be repurposed. For us it’s about repopulating Birkenhead and giving permanence to all parts of the community and all industries. Start up industry and the entrepreneur sector is very big here. It’s giving permanence and understanding what a successful community is about.

“At the moment we have got a lot of space and it’s about repopulating this area with people jobs and more animation really.”

As the President flies to China for a state visit and a scheduled meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping Philippine security forces will intensify their patrols in the disputed waters inside the country’s exclusive economic zone.

MANILA Philippines — Ensuring that territorial defense remains a top priority the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) is increasing its presence in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) even during President Marcos’ scheduled visit to China this week.

As the President flies to China for a state visit and a scheduled meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping Philippine security forces will intensify their patrols in the disputed waters inside the country’s exclusive economic zone.

“We are intensifying our presence there as directed by DND (Department of National Defense)” Col. Medel Aguilar AFP spokesman told reporters yesterday.

“This is in line with the policy direction stated by our Commander-in-Chief at the WPS” he said when asked about the military’s accomplishments in 2022 when it comes to territorial defense.

Marcos and Xi are expected to discuss the WPS and South China Sea (SCS) issues along with other matters affecting the Philippines and China during the state visit.

Since the increased presence of Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) and maritime militia vessels was monitored in the WPS the AFP through the Philippine navy has increased its patrol operations in the area along with the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) and Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources.

The military also continues to send fresh supplies to the grounded BRP Sierra Madre at the Ayungin Shoal despite radio challenges and shadowing activities by the CCG.

Recently National Security Adviser Clarita Carlos noted that the WPS and SCS disputes not only between the Philippines and China but with other claimant countries as well are a food security issue.

“Fish is the real most important resource in the area. Our food security is at stake here” she said in Filipino.

She said she was writing a book that would contain a proposal to have a regional regulatory fishing agreement that will benefit all claimant countries in the SCS.

‘Hire Filipinos’

In another development a seafarers group wants Chinese dredgers operating in Manila Bay for big reclamation projects to hire Filipino seamen to open high-value jobs right here in the country.

The Samahan ng Nagkakaisang Marinong Pilipino (SMNP) is asking the Department of Labor and Employment and Department of Migrant Workers to question why foreign dredgers are not hiring Filipinos to man their vessels working on these projects.

In a letter to Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma and Migrant Workers Secretary Susan Ople dated Dec. 18 2022 SMNP said having these vessels fully manned by foreigners is a “heinous disregard and disrespect to the Filipino seafaring profession.”

The group said the vessels are supposed to be under a bareboat charter (temporarily under Philippine flag arrangement) but continue to employ Chinese crew members which should not allowed by local authorities.

Chinese vessels and their crews are not permitted to do business in Philippine domestic waters unless they are given a special permit by the Maritime Industry Authority (Marina).

The SMNP also wants the PCG Marina and DOLE to inspect the foreign vessels being used in reclamation projects in Manila Bay particularly China Harbor Engineering Corp.’s M/V Liang Ku 9; M/V Liang Ku 99; Shen Zhen Star; Guang Zhou Star; M/V Zhou Hai Star/Atap; M/V Zhua Hai Star; Seastrans Mariner; KG 18; Heng Da 188; Hong Fu 588 (2009-built); M/V Xin Yi 9577; An Da kang 689; Hiong Fu 598; M/V Xin Yi; Hong Fu 588 and Hua Tai Long.

It claimed that the Chinese dredging firm is using 3-in-1 dredgers similar to the vessels used in reclaiming islands in the disputed West Philippine Sea. They started their activity in May 2022 when they started hauling sand from Zambales.

The Marina for its part said the vessels were issued the required permits.

Engineer Marc Anthony Pascua Marina National Capital Region director said the agency issued the required permits to the vessels of China Harbor operating in Manila Bay but noted that employing Chinese crew in such project is not allowed.

Benjamin Guo deputy contractor’s representative for the Pasay Reclamation Project of China Harbor declined to comment on the matter.

The other Chinese company whose vessels were reportedly the subject of an ongoing PCG probe for conducting alleged illegal activity in Manila Bay is the China First Engineering Co. main contractor of the Waterfront Reclamation Project.

Both companies are under the China Communication Construction Corp. or CCCC a company whose subsidiaries had dredging vessels blacklisted by the US government in 2020 for allegedly participating in the building and militarizing of the disputed artificial islands in the South China Sea.

CHEC vessels extract sand from the Bucao River in Botolan Zambales and dump it in Manila Bay under a sand supply contract with a local company called Global Sand Ventures Inc. (GSVI).

One of the incorporators of GSVI belongs to the family of the wife of former executive secretary Victor Rodriguez who owns Halrey Construction Inc. represented by Josefa Halili of Sta. Maria Bulacan.

Many are wondering why the contractor became the supplier of sand to the multibillion Manila Bay reclamation projects when it allegedly does not have a permit from the Departments of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) and of Public Works and Highways and the Zambales local government to extract sand from the Bucao River.

There is also a violation being attached to the GSVI and CHEC. The permittees in Bucao River must be the owners or charterers of the ships used in dredging to ensure that the extraction and dredging activity is in accordance with the regulation of the DENR.

In this case charterers or lessors or the ship managers are not the permittees in the Bucao River.

It was reported that the sand supply deal with the Chinese contractor was sealed when Rodriguez still held office in Malacanang. – Rainier Allan Ronda",,,,,,

WFC,Wells Fargo,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vdGhlZmluYW5jaWFsYnJhbmQuY29tL25ld3MvYmFuay1jdWx0dXJlL2hvdy1oYXJkLWRpZC1jZnBiLWhpdC13ZWxscy1pbi1pdHMtcmVwdXRhdGlvbi12ZXJzdXMtaXRzLXdhbGxldC0xNTc2MTQv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Did CFPB Hit Wells Fargo Its Reputation Harder Than Its Wallet?,"Wells Fargo certainly has had a lot of bad publicity — and fines — over the past six years.

The series of scandals it is trying to overcome kicked off in 2016 when it paid $185 million in fines for opening unauthorized deposit and credit card accounts in customers’ names. Then came a $1 billion settlement with regulators in 2018 over improper auto-loan insurance and mortgage practices. Just months later there was a $2.1 billion settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice for incorrectly denying mortgage modifications including for 400 homeowners who subsequently suffered foreclosure. And it agreed to pay a whopping $3 billion in 2020 to resolve criminal and civil investigations into its past sales practices.

But the latest headlines have heralded the biggest financial hit so far: “Wells Fargo to pay $3.7 billion for mistreating customers” reads one.

The initial news does look bad in part because the numbers are so large. Wells Fargo’s $1.7 billion fine is the largest one levied in the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s history and the bank must pay out an additional $2 billion in redress to consumers who have been harmed. Analysts expect the bank also will have to sock away billions more for future claims fines and legal expenses.

Is this the end for Wells Fargo? Hardly. But surely it will pay a huge price? Not necessarily. Won’t its reputation suffer? It depends. What lessons will it learn? Too early to tell.

But there are lessons to learn.

There are also steps Wells Fargo — and any financial institution facing negative publicity — can take with an eye to repairing relationships with key audiences and reviving a tarnished brand.

Taking a Closer Look at Wells Fargo’s Regulatory Turmoil

The CFPB settlement was announced in late December 2022. It resolves charges that the bank improperly denied mortgage modifications caused unwarranted foreclosures illegally repossessed cars froze bank accounts assessed unexpected fees that may or may not have actually been due and hung onto unused insurance product payments rather than refunding them. More than 16 million consumer accounts were affected.

Wells Fargo agreed to the settlement without admitting guilt. However President and Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf issued a statement — in his name rather than in the generic name of the bank — saying that Wells Fargo and its regulators had identified “a series of unacceptable practices” that it has been working to change. “This far-reaching agreement is an important milestone in our work to transform the operating practices at Wells Fargo and put these issues behind us” he said.

That certainly sounds a lot like “Yeah we did it.”

But it’s worth noting that at the same time the CFPB terminated a 2016 consent order and provided a path toward terminating a 2018 consent order. So Scharf has some basis for his hopeful comment about Wells Fargo getting past its issues.

Will the bank’s reputation and business suffer? Multiple fronts have to be considered.

Banking is one of the most highly regulated industries — proof that piling on rules does not guarantee obedience. So regulators are a key audience here.

Investors are as well. After all they put the money in to create expand and run the business. Customers should be in the top tier of key constituencies as should employees who are responsible for doing the remedial work.

There is another important component of that top tier too. Virtually all the community banks my firm works with would have their local communities at the very top of the list of key audiences. Money-center banks tend to partner with large brand-name charities and various civic organizations which also are part of the community constituency.

Now let’s get more specific. Far and away regulators and other government agencies have to be the most important audience for Wells Fargo right now. There are hordes of them and they have served notice that they are looking at the bank as the poster child of bad business behavior.

How do we know? They’ve told us.

“In the CFPB’s 11 years of existence Wells Fargo has consistently been one of the most problematic repeat offenders of the banks and credit unions we supervise” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said when announcing the $3 billion settlement in December.

A stated goal for Chopra is to come down hardest on repeat offenders. His intention is to work with other federal banking regulators in the coming year to further punish Wells Fargo for being as he put it a “corporate recidivist.”

Other federal officials are conducting their own probes as well. In September the bank was ordered to pay $22 million for allegedly firing an executive who tried to report that employees had committed or been instructed to commit wire fraud price fixing and falsification of customer information. This enforcement action was from the Labor Department which is also investigating complaints of employees being harassed and forced to open unauthorized accounts to meet sales goals.

Investors See Beyond CFPB’s Headline Grab to Brighter Future

What about investors? Are they spooked by the huge settlement? Apparently not.

Although Wells Fargo’s stock fell somewhat — it is down 14% for the year including the 1.5% drop in reaction to the CFPB settlement — investors have read beyond the headlines. In fact Jason Goldberg senior equity analyst at Barclays told CNBC that with the latest regulatory developments and performance improvements it seems like “the bulk of the issues are in the rearview mirror.”

The fines and restitution of $3.7 billion turn out to be manageable. After taxes Wells Fargo is still expected to be profitable in the fourth quarter. In addition analysts at Jefferies and elsewhere noted that they expect the amount Wells Fargo sets aside for future penalties will decline compared with past amounts.

“The bulk of the issues are in the rearview mirror.”

— Jason Goldberg Barclays



My late father an ophthalmologist had a number of pithy mottos. One that fits the Wells Fargo situation: “It’s better to be lucky than smart but the trick lies in knowing the difference.”

Beyond the analysts’ post-settlement outlook Wells Fargo got lucky in the bigger picture. Unlike other banks it doesn’t face the need to raise additional capital because of what’s called the “global systemic risk score.” Without diving into the minutia this is an unintended gift from the Federal Reserve which has been requiring the bank to operate under what’s called a “penalty asset cap.” (Some think the impact this measure had on Wells Fargo’s deposit strategy may actually produce a performance tailwind in 2023.)

And if you thought higher interest rates were bad you may be surprised to learn that’s not the case for everyone. The bank will pick up significant gains in earnings for every percentage point rise in interest rates.

These facts have made Wells Fargo a top performer among bank stocks. In fact a CNN Business canvas of bank analysts in late December 2022 projected a median stock price increase over 2023 of 33.1%.

So Wells Fargo got lucky. But did the bank get smart yet?

Wells Fargo Should Get Smarter About Customer Communication

The first thing to look at is how Wells Fargo has explained itself to customers getting restitution. In 2019 the bank announced a major rebranding campaign as a way to mark what was supposed to be closure around the allegations of opening unauthorized accounts. I thought they had missed an opportunity.

At the time I was just paying off a Wells Fargo home equity loan and as I noted in The Financial Brand‘s article about the rebranding the bank representative was professional and friendly but never took the opportunity to say something like: “Thank you for giving us a chance” or “We want to live up to our promise to our customers.”

Restitution Sets Up Fresh Opportunity:

Wells Fargo's current round of restitution could be a chance to communicate about the future with customers not only in writing but also with video website messages and possibly social media.

This is a moment to channel my alma mater Columbia Business School to ask some basic questions: What is Wells Fargo’s business model? Does the bank provide products and services to customers in a manner and at a price that allows them to attract investors and fund the operation of the business and to recruit and retain the trained employees necessary?

The answers to the above questions are affirmative. Analyses from BusinessInsider and NerdWallet identify Wells Fargo as having 16000 ATMs; more branches than competitor JPMorgan Chase (4800 versus 4000); lower monthly fees and minimum balance requirements; and “easily manageable checking accounts.”

The internet provides a prospective customer with dependable comparative information. One has to do a lot of searching through this type of info before encountering the question “What is Wells Fargo in trouble for?” And even then it only yields four or five laconic lines about the CFPB settlements.

Is the bank providing these products and services at a price that generates enough revenue to attract investors? Clearly yes particularly if the Jefferies analysts are correct.

Now we get to the seemingly throwaway phrases in my questions about providing service things like “in a manner” and by “trained employees.” As far as we can tell no one in the C-suite sent out an email saying “Here’s our chance to make some extra funds. Go ahead. Stick these fees on.”

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is trying to hold several former executives accountable but it’s hard to believe they jumped out of bed and said “I’m going to break the rules today!” This seems to be a question of past leadership and probably of how financial incentives were handed out to — and by — top executives. (Indeed there was a widespread industry reckoning with sales practices and incentive structures after the initial scandal at the bank hit.)

This is the real challenge for Wells Fargo: Can management develop and instill throughout the company a real mission of servant leadership recognizing that this doesn’t come just from a pep-talk email from the CEO?

Critical Steps Wells Fargo Needs to be Taking

Such direction has to come from discussions and observations over months and years of how the top people behave versus what they say. CEO Scharf characterizes this task as a commitment “to transform the operating practices” at the bank. Wells Fargo is already well underway in doing that. But ultimately the problem is not solely about operating practices. The bank’s real challenges lie in culture and leadership.

A common practice when big organizations get into regulatory trouble is to hire an outside law firm or consultant pay them seven or eight figures and have them produce a report. This checks all the boxes. Such efforts produce a weighty document from a third party to show to regulators. However it’s unlikely to bring about the desired results.

So what can Wells Fargo do? I’d suggest taking a lesson from Marc Shapiro when he was CEO of what was then Texas Commerce Bank.

Texas Commerce embarked on a drive for companywide transformation. The goal was to identify millions of dollars of cost savings but also to examine how the bank provided products and services and recruited trained and deployed staff.

Shapiro decreed that the bank would put a spotlight on itself. It set up internal teams with minimal outside expertise aside from firms that were already working with the bank (mine was one).

The Texas Commerce effort involved a cultural shift and that’s part of what Wells Fargo must demonstrate. If the bank’s not already doing the following here are the types of efforts Scharf could be implementing:

• Empower train and encourage Wells Fargo executives to be brand ambassadors and to talk to as many groups as possible about how banking benefits the community.

These brand ambassadors would have to do a lot of listening — and they would have to learn how to respond to criticism and complaints.

That’s the price in order to get the opportunity to re-introduce the Wells Fargo brand.

• Set up a way to collect stories of employees who have gone above and beyond their job descriptions to reach out to customers and help them.

Vet share and tell the stories. Do the same to collect such examples from customers.

• Find strong examples to emulate. Learn how companies like FedEx and Mary Kay made storytelling a part of their culture and just as importantly how they lived up to the values embedded in these stories versus just paying them lip service.

Cultural Change Takes Engaged Leadership:

The CEO and other top executives have to be everywhere cheering people on and telling stories about successes. They have to become adept at using humor and props and embrace every other way of engaging employees.

This kind of long-term hands on internal effort is necessary because what Wells Fargo faces isn’t a short term challenge and can’t be addressed with an off-the-shelf initiative. An effort with such an extended duration is possible because the bank’s underlying business model appears to be sound.

Just as important this cultural work will create a virtuous circle where customer-facing employees can provide credible proof of how they are serving people and actual customers can provide stories of how the bank is truly helping them.

And that’s the piece that can’t be skipped or just validated with aggregate statistics. Wells Fargo needs real people talking about real experiences.

Again it takes time but it can work and if the bank invests in and commits to this it will be not only lucky but smart.

Customers are increasingly using digital channels and transacting less often in branches. Mike Slusark

Customers may have recently found a notice in their mail regarding the March 8 2023 closing of the branch meaning customers who do their banking there will have to make future transactions at the next closest branch in Brainerd.

""This is not an easy decision or one we take lightly"" Mike Slusark lead communications consultant on the Wells Fargo public affairs team said in an email. ""This change will not affect customers’ accounts. Customers will be served by our Brainerd branch at 424 West Washington Street approximately 18 miles away. That branch has the same services offered at Pequot Lakes.""

The closure includes the branch office ATM and safe deposit boxes. The future of the building at the corner of Main and Front streets is uncertain.

""We own it so we’re considering future options"" Slusark wrote.

Employees at the Pequot Lakes branch will need to find other jobs possibly by reapplying at other Wells Fargo branches.

""Because this location is being closed employees won’t have a position but can apply for other positions within the company for which they are qualified"" Slusark wrote. ""We understand the impact closing a branch can have and are very thoughtful and deliberate in our approach.""

Slusark said Wells Fargo came to the decision based on changing customer needs market factors and economic trends. One factor was the increased dependence upon electronic banking especially during and following the COVID-19 pandemic.

""Customers are increasingly using digital channels and transacting less often in branches"" Slusark said.

The Pequot Lakes building before Wells Fargo moved in has a storied history including an August 1929 robbery where two or three assailants fleeced the bank at gunpoint of $7997.53 $900 in bonds and three diamonds.

The bank was then a Farmers State Bank branch. The robbery sent area residents into high alert resulting in armed posses who joined the hunt attempting to track down the two men.

The trail was lost at the Oshawa Store on State Highway 87 west of Backus.

""The money was thrust into a grain sack and then the bandit ran into the vault where he took additional cash especially a large number of one dollar bills"" reads the Aug. 30 1929 Pequot Review newspaper.

The one collecting the money named Jack according to witnesses ushered the customers and employees into the unlocked vault. Robbers escaped in a blue Hupmobile.

Historical documents and artifacts from the Pequot Lakes branch will be sent to either history centers or Wells Fargo Museum.

As we learned to live with COVID-19 in our communities during 2022 the local news focus on my beats centered once again on public health legislative and economic developments.

Forsyth County's largest employer — Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center at more than 13000 workers — became a part of the national healthcare consolidation churn for the second time.

After tying its future in October 2019 to Atrium Health in a ""strategic combination"" featuring a long-sought medical school in Charlotte Baptist became on Dec. 2 part of the nation's fifth-largest healthcare system when Atrium merged with Advocate Aurora to form Advocate Health.

The great debate on Medicaid expansion in North Carolina came close to reaching an agreement between the state House and Senate in June only to be carried over into the 2023 session by Republican legislature leaders.

That meant between 450000 and 650000 potential beneficiaries were forced to wait another year for action as North Carolina remained one of just 12 non-expansion states all with Republican-controlled legislatures.

The stunning overnight collapse of United Furniture Industries Inc. on Nov. 22 permanently closed five Triad facilities — where it was reported to have had between 530 and 600 employees including between 50 and 70 in Winston-Salem. United also eliminated 199 jobs in ending local production in July.

United's shutdown — one of the largest manufacturing job cuts in the nation at 2700 overall — sent employees into a job market offering the promise of other manufacturing employment and the nation's most stringent unemployment benefits.

A major factor of COVID-19 during 2022 involved more Triad residents becoming overwhelmed by medical debt burdens an issue that became heated talking point in the legislature.

A local example was Kernersville resident Alicia Pender whose life turned into a physical and emotional tailspin since her COVID-19 diagnosis in December 2020.

However what is causing Pender the most stress she said is being overwhelmed by more than $30000 in COVID-19 related medical bills.

In April the nearly 18-year saga surrounding controversial Winston-Salem Dr. Anne Litton White came to a conclusion when she closed her practice as part of the indefinite suspension of her medical license issued in March.

White had been the operator of Carolina Laser and Cosmetic Center since 2004.

White has been subject to a board notice of charges and allegations six times before closing her practice the others occurring in 2004 2005 2008 2017 and 2018-20.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHA6Ly9icmlzdG93YmVhdC5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy9wb2xpY2UtYXJyZXN0LXdlbGxzLWZhcmdvLDIyNDM30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Police Arrest Maryland Man for Bank Robberies in Prince William Reston,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: 403 for url: http://bristowbeat.com/stories/police-arrest-wells-fargo,22437 on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPmh0dHA6Ly9icmlzdG93YmVhdC5jb20vc3Rvcmllcy9wb2xpY2UtYXJyZXN0LXdlbGxzLWZhcmdvLDIyNDM30gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiQWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmlucXVpcmVyLmNvbS9waG90by9zaXhlcnMtb3Zlci1wZWxpY2Fucy0yMDIzMDEwMi5odG1s0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Scenes from the Sixers' 120-111 win over the Pelicans,Sixers James Harden tries to keep Joel Embiid away while he spins the ball on his finger as the clock winds down against the Pelicans during the 4th quarter at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia Monday January 2 2023.

The 2TB Kingston is up against other 2TB drives including the Crucial P3 Plus the Adata XPG Gammix S50 Lite the Corsair MP600 GS the SK hynix Gold P31 the Solidigm P41 Plus the WD Black SN770 and the Samsung 990 Pro.

Trace Testing - 3DMark Storage Benchmark

Built for gamers 3DMark’s Storage Benchmark focuses on real-world gaming performance. Each round in this benchmark stresses storage based on gaming activities including loading games saving progress installing game files and recording gameplay video streams.

The NV2 comes in dead last and by a significant margin. It’s the worst for score bandwidth and latency. There’s really no excuse here as the P41 Plus which has the same flash is far superior and the S50 Lite with the same class of controller but with DRAM is also faster. The NV2’s older DRAM-less controller just can’t hang. It should still be close enough with load times so is fine for a dedicated games drive.

Trace Testing – PCMark 10 Storage Benchmark

PCMark 10 is a trace-based benchmark that uses a wide-ranging set of real-world traces from popular applications and everyday tasks to measure the performance of storage devices.

The NV2 is below average in PCMark although it manages to still beat the popular Gold P31. The S50 Lite is using the DRAM-equipped version of the NV2’s controller the SMI SM2267 but with older flash.

Transfer Rates – DiskBench

We use the DiskBench storage benchmarking tool to test file transfer performance with a custom 50GB dataset. We copy 31227 files of various types such as pictures PDFs and videos to a new folder and then follow-up with a reading test of a newly-written 6.5GB zip file.

The NV2 copies at a slow speed no better than the PCIe 3.0 Gold P31 or the entry-level PCIe 4.0 drives entry-level meaning glorified PCIe 3.0 drives like the S50 Lite and NV2. There’s little reason to waste a 4.0 slot on these drives.

Synthetic Testing - ATTO / CrystalDiskMark

ATTO and CrystalDiskMark (CDM) are free and easy-to-use storage benchmarking tools that SSD vendors commonly use to assign performance specifications to their products. Both of these tools give us insight into how each device handles different file sizes.

The NV2 is essentially dead last in ATTO. CDM sequential performance is below average to poor. 4KB performance is also relatively poor although it beats out the P3 Plus for reads at a queue depth of 1. This is adequate for a gaming drive but basically only provides a budget experience.

Sustained Write Performance and Cache Recovery

Official write specifications are only part of the performance picture. Most SSDs implement a write cache which is a fast area of (usually) pseudo-SLC programmed flash that absorbs incoming data. Sustained write speeds can suffer tremendously once the workload spills outside of the cache and into the ""native"" TLC or QLC flash. We use Iometer to hammer the SSD with sequential writes for 15 minutes to measure both the size of the write cache and performance after the cache is saturated. We also monitor cache recovery via multiple idle rounds.

Image 1 of 5 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

The 2TB NV2 maintains 2.95GBps in pSLC mode for over 190 seconds for a cache of 561GB. This implies that the entire drive is capable of pSLC mode so the dynamic cache should usually be about one-fourth the size of the free space. The cache is relatively quick to recover as expected.

QLC mode flatlines around 240MBps which is not terrible for QLC but still pretty poor on the whole. This is about what we would expect from this flash when using such a wide cache. Comparisons to the P3 Plus and P41 Plus are enlightening to see how cache size and pSLC speed impact QLC performance. This is a drive that will suffer when fuller particularly with prolonged writes.

Power Consumption and Temperature

We use the Quarch HD Programmable Power Module to gain a deeper understanding of power characteristics. Idle power consumption is an important aspect to consider especially if you're looking for a laptop upgrade as even the best ultrabooks can have mediocre storage.

Some SSDs can consume watts of power at idle while better-suited ones sip just milliwatts. Average workload power consumption and max consumption are two other aspects of power consumption but performance-per-watt is more important. A drive might consume more power during any given workload but accomplishing a task faster allows the drive to drop into an idle state more quickly ultimately saving energy.

Temperatures are gauged at both idle and load states via sensor and an infrared thermometer. The typical ambient temperature is at 24C. The load state involves sustained writes at maximum speed with measurement ensuing if and until throttling is demonstrated to discover the equilibrium temperature.

Image 1 of 4 (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware) (Image credit: Tom's Hardware)

NV2 power efficiency is fairly terrible as expected. This will still be an unfortunately popular drive for laptops as it’s single-sided and dirt cheap. If this drive isn’t regularly pushed and it shouldn’t be it may be passable with its power usage but there are many better options.

Normally with QLC-based drives we won’t see throttling because the QLC mode is too slow. The 2TB NV2 runs hot though another characteristic of its controller since it’s 28nm technology. The drive idled at 56C by IR and 37C in SMART a wide deviation between measurements then hit 86C and 70C respectively after roughly 500GB of sustained writes. At this point the drive began to throttle.

These temperatures make it difficult to recommend for laptop use. While it takes a lot of writes to get the drive to throttle the high idle temperature is concerning. A heatsink is recommended for other use.

We use an Alder Lake platform with most background applications such as indexing windows updates and anti-virus disabled in the OS to reduce run-to-run variability. Each SSD is prefilled to 50% capacity and tested as a secondary device. Unless noted we use active cooling for all SSDs.

Conclusion

The Kingston NV2 is simply not a drive we can recommend in most cases because the range of hardware it can have makes it too risky for the buyer. You could get the great SM2269XT or the mediocre SM2267XT controller. You could get BiCS5 TLC or much slower QLC. None of these will have DRAM and it’s probably unfair to call this a PCIe 4.0 drive on top of all that.

In testing the drive also ran hot even when idle and it draws a decent amount of power making it less than ideal for many machines including laptops. Its saving grace is its amazing price which does make it perhaps good for something other than a primary drive.

Despite this you may not want to roll the dice and hope you get lucky. It is probably better to approach it from a worst-case perspective: this is a budget drive designed to be a cheap way to add more NVMe-class storage. If you have worked with the A400 or NV1 then you know what to expect with the NV2. Many motherboards come with their own M.2 heatsinks or shields which can also help alleviate any heat problems this drive might have mitigating one of its downsides.

Our samples both use the SMI SM2267XT controller which did not perform well with either TLC or QLC. The flash in either case is actually not bad. It’s just that there are so many better options on the market. Pricing really is the ultimate factor here that you must consider when looking at the NV2. It may be okay for a gaming drive if it’s priced competitively against SATA alternatives but this implies you want higher capacity. At lower capacities it’s simply a way to upgrade an old machine cheaply - but we did not review those SKUs.

TikTok is an addictive drug China’s government is providing to Americans says the incoming chairman of a new House select committee on China.

GOP Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin told NBC’s “Meet The Press” in an interview that aired Sunday that he calls TikTok “digital fentanyl” because “it’s highly addictive and destructive and we’re seeing troubling data about the corrosive impact of constant social media use particularly on young men and women here in America” and also because it “effectively goes back to the Chinese Communist Party.”

Gallagher whom House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy has appointed to chair the new select committee in the new Congress has said he believes the video app should be banned in the United States. (McCarthy is the apparent front-runner to become House speaker when the new session begins Tuesday though he still does not have enough vote commitments to be elected in the floor vote.)

TikTok whose parent company ByteDance is Chinese-owned has been banned from electronic devices managed by the US House of Representatives according to an internal notice sent to House staff. Separately the US government will ban TikTok from all federal devices as part of legislation included in the $1.7 trillion omnibus bill that President Joe Biden signed last week. The move comes after more than a dozen states in recent weeks have implemented their own prohibitions against TikTok on government devices.

The company in a statement said Gallagher’s comments contain “zero truth.”

“The Chinese Communist Party has neither direct nor indirect control of ByteDance or TikTok” the company said. “ByteDance is a private global company nearly 60% of which is owned by global institutional investors with the rest owned primarily by the company’s founders and its employees — including thousands of Americans.”

TikTok has previously called efforts to ban the app from government devices “a political gesture that will do nothing to advance national security interests.” TikTok declined to comment on the House restrictions.

Reining in TikTok

Gallagher says he wants to go further. As TikTok surges in popularity he believes it needs to be reined in.

“We have to ask whether we want the CCP to control what’s on the cusp of becoming the most powerful media company in America” he told NBC. Gallagher supported the ban on TikTok on government devices and said the United States should “expand that ban nationally.”

The company has been accused of censoring content that is politically sensitive to the Chinese government including banning some accounts that posted about China’s mass detention camps in its western region of Xinjiang. The US State Department estimates that up to 2 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities have been detained in these camps.

“What if they start censoring the news right? What if they start tweaking the algorithm to determine what the CCP deems fit to print” Gallagher warned analogizing the situation to the KGB and Pravda buying The New York Times and other major newspapers during the height of the Cold War.

US policymakers have cited TikTok as a potential national security risk and critics have said ByteDance could be compelled by Chinese authorities to hand over TikTok data pertaining to US citizens or to act as a channel for malign influence operations. Security experts have said that the data could allow China to identify intelligence opportunities or to seek to influence Americans through disinformation campaigns.

There is no evidence that that has actually occurred though the company last month confirmed that it fired four employees who improperly accessed the TikTok user data of two journalists on the platform.

But TikTok has hundreds of millions of downloads in the United States and the highly influential social media platform has helped countless online creators build brands and livelihoods. As its popularity soars TikTok may have grown too big to ban.

Working toward a resolution

Since 2020 TikTok has been negotiating with the US government on a potential deal to resolve the national security concerns and allow the app to remain available to US users. TikTok has said that the potential agreement under review covers “key concerns around corporate governance content recommendation and moderation and data security and access.” The company has also taken some steps to wall off US user data organizationally and technologically from other parts of TikTok’s business.

But an apparent lack of progress in the talks has led some of TikTok’s critics including in Congress and at the state level to push for the app to be banned from government devices and potentially more broadly.

Gallagher said on “Meet the Press” that he would be open to a sale of TikTok to an American company but “the devil is in the details.” He continued “I don’t think this should be a partisan issue.”

When asked about Russia’s investment in Telegram and the Saudi investment in Twitter Gallagher said that his “broad concern of which both of those are part is where we see authoritarian governments exploiting technology in order to exert total control over their citizens” calling it “techno-totalitarian control.”

Gallagher also called for “reciprocity” noting that Chinese officials are allowed on apps like Twitter but Chinese citizens are not allowed access to those same apps. He said he would like to see an arrangement under which “if your government doesn’t allow your citizens access to the platform we’re going to deny your government officials access to that same platform.”

“The government can’t raise your kids can’t protect your kids for you” Gallagher said “but there are certain sensible things we can do in order to create a healthier social media ecosystem.”",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWFyY2Jlcm1hbjEvMjAyMy8wMS8wMS90di1mbGFzaGJhY2stZmFtaWx5LXdlc3Rlcm4tZHItcXVpbm4tbWVkaWNpbmUtd29tYW4tdHVybnMtMzAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,TV Flashback: Family Western 'Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman' Turns 30,"ERROR: Article `download()` failed with HTTPSConnectionPool(host='news.google.com', port=443): Max retries exceeded with url: /articles/CBMicWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmZvcmJlcy5jb20vc2l0ZXMvbWFyY2Jlcm1hbjEvMjAyMy8wMS8wMS90di1mbGFzaGJhY2stZmFtaWx5LXdlc3Rlcm4tZHItcXVpbm4tbWVkaWNpbmUtd29tYW4tdHVybnMtMzAv0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen (Caused by ConnectTimeoutError(<urllib3.connection.HTTPSConnection object at 0x00000228E35976D0>, 'Connection to news.google.com timed out.

The most nationally-publicized kidnapping case was that of the 20-month-old son of famed aviator Charles Lindbergh in 1932 — a case which ended with the death of the Lindbergh child as well as the controversial death of the suspect.

Later in Tacoma Washington the publicity surrounding the 1935 kidnapping of nine-year old George Weyerhaeuser heir to the prominent Weyerhaeuser timber fortune drew the nation’s attention. The ransom in that case was paid and young George was returned safely to his family. George Weyerhaeuser lived a long and productive life — eventually heading the family’s lucrative lumber business. He lived to the age of 95 passing away during 2022. He was one of the lucky victims of this type of crime.

Since these cases fell under the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Investigation the background of the FBI in the Seattle area is noteworthy. The Bureau’s presence in the area goes back to 1914 when it was known as the Bureau of Investigation. Mainly active during the WWI time period the Bureau’s cases included those which violated federal criminal law. The early cases were mainly prohibition violent bank robberies and suspected German sympathizers. With the ending of WWI and the elimination of most of the notorious crime figures during the 1920s the Bureau’s office in Seattle was closed in 1932 and cases were then handled out of the Portland office.

Little of national importance happened in the Seattle area until the 1935 kidnapping of young George Weyerhaeuser in Tacoma as mentioned above. However it was later because of the December 1936 kidnapping and subsequent murder of another Tacoma boy Charles Fletcher Mattson Seattle established a permanent FBI presence in March of 1937 and an Acting Special Agent in Charge of the Bureau’s Field Division was appointed. Since that time the FBI has always maintained an office in Seattle.

With the 1936/1937 kidnapping and death of Charles Fletcher Mattson the FBI soon realized it had another major case to solve. On a personal note the fatal conclusion to the Mattson kidnapping was too close to home and as a young girl I learned about monsters.

The kidnapping and death of 10-year-old Charles Fletcher Mattson

I was 9 years old (soon to be 10) when the frozen and partially snow-covered body of 10-year-old Charles Mattson was discovered lying in a field a few miles northwest of our north Alderwood Manor chicken farm. The finding of his naked and battered body so close to Alderwood Manor and north Edmonds brought FBI agents and other law enforcement personnel swarming over the brush-covered area several miles south of the Everett city limits. Possibly because of its isolation and a few unoccupied farms in the vicinity the north Alderwood Manor area appeared to be of special interest.

Eighty-six years later I have never forgotten that snowy January of 1937 and the events happening in what is now Lynnwood. When a couple of stone-faced federal agents come knocking on your door to ask questions you tend sit up and take notice — and to remember.

Thus with the kidnapping and brutal murder of Charles Mattson the FBI had another nationally prominent case to deal with. Code named MATTNAP the case was first opened by the Portland division of the FBI but soon became the responsibility of the reopened Seattle office. At least eight local agents were assigned to the case. Also FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover ordered about 40 extra agents to the area along with his assistant director to take charge of the investigation. To this day even with the involvement of the big guns the mystery of this fatal kidnapping has never been solved and MATTNAP continues to remain an open case in the FBI files.

A synopsis of the Charles Mattson kidnapping case and its fatal ending

Two days after Christmas on a Sunday evening about 8:45 on Dec. 27 1936 the three Mattson children and a family friend were in the living room of the home of socially prominent Tacoma physician and surgeon Dr. William W. Mattson and his wife Hazel. The children were enjoying an evening eating popcorn and drinking root beer. In the house with 10-year-old Charles Mattson were his 16-year-old brother Billy his sister Muriel age 14 and Virginia a 15-year-old friend from Seattle. The parents Dr. and Mrs. Mattson were attending a holiday social function that evening and were scheduled to be home soon.

Suddenly there was the sound of a loud knocking on the French doors opening onto a terrace at the back of the Mattson family’s Tudor-style mansion. As Charles went to look outside he saw a man standing on the terrace; his face covered by a mask. The masked stranger continued banging on the door when suddenly using a handgun he broke the glass in the door. Opening the door the masked man walked into the house. After demanding money which the children didn’t have and then frightening them he grabbed Charles dropped a note on the floor and with the small boy in his arms he fled into the night heading toward Tacoma’s Commencement Bay. During the time the rather agitated intruder was menacing the children his mask slipped giving them a clear view of his face. From the description given the FBI was able to construct a drawing of the kidnapper.

The note the stranger threw on the floor was a demand for $28000 as ransom. The paper on which the demand note was printed was folded and worn as if it had been in the man’s pocket for a lengthy time and the seemingly generic message appeared to have been printed using a child’s toy typewriter. Without success Dr. Mattson tried several times to make arrangements with the kidnapper to pay the ransom demand. The ransom was never paid and Charles was never seen alive again.

On Monday morning January 11 1937 fifteen days after the kidnapping in Tacoma Charles Mattson’s body was found in south Snohomish County many miles to the north. His remains had been left in an alder thicket about 150 feet west of the Edmonds-Beverly Park Road one-half mile west of Pacific Highway (Highway 99) and Westerberg’s Corner (a gas station and home belonging to Conrad Westerberg). Nineteen-year-old Gordon Morrow was out that morning hunting rabbits in a field nearby when he stumbled upon the body. He ran home to tell his father and then ran a half mile to the Westerberg’s gas station where he was able to use a telephone to notify the Snohomish County Sheriff of his grim discovery.

Nearby footprints and tire tracks in the fresh snow indicated to authorities that Charles had been killed at a different location and his remains dumped in that out-of-the-way snow-covered field either late Sunday night or early Monday morning.

An examination showed Charles Mattson had been bound with a rope and harshly mistreated — in fact brutally beaten. It was assumed that Charles had probably died close to the previous Thursday — his body frozen for several days before being dumped at the spot where it was discovered.

Labeled as Public Enemy No. 1 the drawing of the suspect was published locally as well as in many newspapers around the country and it also appeared on flyers posted by the FBI on the walls of U.S. Post Offices and other public and private buildings.

From the time I was an impressionable 9-year-old girl to this day the image of the unknown abductor will be remembered by me as the face of a monster. A few months after this tragic event I was glad when we moved from our wilderness farm to live close to downtown Edmonds.

More concern for law enforcement and residents of Alderwood Manor

During the tumultuous days of the search for a vicious killer law enforcement personnel and residents of Alderwood Manor remained nervous and on high alert. Consequently on Friday Jan. 22 1937 concern was immediately raised when someone broke into the Alderwood Manor Post Office and it was burglarized.

On Jan. 29 the Edmonds Tribune Review reported that “Less than $45 in silver one money order book and rubber stamps were the loot obtained from the Alderwood Manor post office last Friday night when the place was broken into by forcing open the front door shortly after midnight. A sleighing party reported seeing a light in the post office about one a.m. but the only thought it occasioned was that someone was working late.

“Upon entering the place Saturday morning Mrs. H. Parker the postmaster saw something to arouse her suspicions and her attention was attracted by numerous small articles in the outer office that were not in their usual places as if someone had dropped them to leave in a hurry. Then she noticed the door to the inner room was open and upon entering she found that drawers had been pried open and ransacked and two bags one containing silver and another rolled pennies were gone. The currency however was untouched the robber evidently thinking the two bags which were quite heavy represented a considerable sum of money and all that would be found. The strangest part of it was Mrs. Parker said that the drawers containing the currency had been gone through possibly in searching for the money order blanks and the currency remained undiscovered.

“All indications were that the theft had been committed hurriedly and had ended abruptly probably upon some alarm coming from outside. Fresh snow had fallen so that all footprints were obliterated the only sign of anyone approaching the place were tracks of an automobile that had swerved in toward the door but evidently had not stopped.

“The sheriff’s office in Everett was immediately notified and following an investigation it was announced that they believed there might be some connection between the theft and the Mattson kidnapping case which kept Alderwood and the surrounding territory under close surveillance for the past several weeks.”

After several months of investigation and a few false leads in November of 1937 a former Seattle street car operator was arrested and pled guilty to the post office burglary and it was determined there was no connection to the Mattson kidnapping case. In addition to the guilty plea evidence from the theft location was found at the suspect’s home. Since the suspect was unable to post the $5000 bond he was held for the federal grand jury. Convicted of the post office burglary he was sentenced to serve time at the federal penitentiary on McNeil Island where he was still imprisoned in the 1940s.

Updates to the story of Charles Fletcher Mattson

In 2006 the palatial Tudor-style home built for Dr. William Mattson and his family was razed by the current owner — to be replaced by a completely different style home.

In 2011 the book Taken in the Night written by popular Northwest true-crime writer Gregg Olsen was published. In his book Mr. Olsen tells the story of the kidnapping of Charles Mattson and the finding of his body by 19-year-old Gordon Morrow.

January 02 2023 Chad Holloway PR & Media Manager

The $10400 World Poker Tour (WPT) World Championship at Wynn Las Vegas proved to be a tremendous success as Eliot Hudon beat out 2960 entrants to win the tournament for $4.1 million.

The festival offered more than $22 million in guaranteed prize pools being offered across 23 events and that number was blown out of the water thanks to a massive turnout. Here are some of the headlines to come out of the series

Among those to win side event titles were Ethan “Rampage” Yau ($25K High Roller for $894240) Calen “Big Wheel” McNeil ($600 Limit Omaha 8/B for $21305) Sergio Grosso ($1100 Seniors NLH for $130806) Lawrence Berg ($600 PLO Turbo for $46307) and Christopher Puetz ($1600 NLH Bounty Turbo for $79576).

We already offered a recap from early in the series – which included titles for Allen Kessler Esther Taylor and Sean Banahan – and we thought we’d kick off the New Year with a quick look back at those who captured titles in the closing days of the WPT World Championship.

Italy’s Federico Cirillo Victorious in $1600 Mystery Bounty

Federico Cirillo

From December 16-19 the $1600 buy-in $2M GTD Mystery Bounty attracted 3715 runners over the course of three starting flights. That more than doubled the guarantee by creating a $5386750 prize pool. We already reported on the big $250000 winners (congrats Dave McGowan) as well as Ren Lin winning $150000 thanks to back-to-back envelope pulls. Read more about that here.

Here are some highlights from the bounty draws:

That is probably why The Current’s listeners chose it as the No. 1 song of the Top 89 of 2022.

In Lizzo’s HBO Max documentary Love Lizzo she says she wrote “About Damn Time” and the rest of her album Special while feeling sad mad and hurt. Over the past couple of years all of us have experienced one or a combination of those same feelings. The whole world felt the effects of the pandemic to varying degrees. Lizzo knows this.

She empathically checks in on fans when she poses the questions “Is everybody back up in the buildin'? / It's been a minute tell me how you're healin'” and “How you feelin'? How you feel right now?” As the culture heals a new normal arises and the feelings we’ve had become yesterday’s problems. In an interview she did with Sean Evans on the “wings and an interview” web series Hot Ones she exclaims “we needed [‘About Damn Time’] right when it dropped.” The song’s unmatched timing and message captures the zeitgeist of this weird period in time.

Released April 14 “About Damn Time” was Lizzo’s first single of 2022 but the last song she wrote for her fourth studio album Special. It arrived at the front-end of a wave of upbeat releases this year — Beyonce’s Renaissance Rina Sawayama’s Hold the Girl and Drake’s Honestly Nevermind.

Playing into the line “too fine to be this stressed” the song’s music video appropriately opens with a Stressed and Sexy support group congregating. In the short skit the group leader asks attendees for an assignment she gave in presumably the previous meeting. As the leader calls on Lizzo to present her poem first she gives an award-winning performance by acting surprised while taking a sip of her beverage. (A second Emmy is already in order.) As soon as a loud yet quiet “ANYWAY” echoes the music begins.

The theatrics plays into the underlying playfulness of the song with lines like “feelin' fussy walkin' in my Balenci-ussies” while still accompanying the more serious ones such as “I been so down and under pressure.” The oscillation between the low spirits and classic Lizzo confidence in the lyrics are a familiar balance of emotions. Then the first strum of the bass is like a beck and call and without a second thought the disco-pop track mesmerizes you.

Social media had been salivating for its long overdue roaring 2020s moment and “About Damn Time” just might’ve been the catalyst. On TikTok in particular Lizzo got caught up in a dance challenge when user Jaeden Gomez choreographed some moves to the second verse. The app has the ability to blow up a song in no time and it did just that. The trend was already going viral but after Lizzo promoted the dance the machine got working. Others joined in such as Reese Witherspoon Gisele Bündchen Selena Gomez Joe Jonas among others. It got to the point where Lizzo had to come back on TikTok and gently correct the poor rhythmless people clapping off the beat.

She went on to demonstrate the dance on The Late Late Show With James Corden segment “Carpool Karaoke” where she tapped the original dance creator Jaeden to appear in the bit. Bringing the dance to television further cemented the reach of “About Damn Time.”

Live or through a pair of over-ear headphones “About Damn Time” holds an unarguable amount of magic. When Lizzo graced us with her presence at the Xcel Energy Center she described it as a “homecoming.” The entire concert felt like a long-awaited reunion when the protagonist returns from a long journey after achieving their goal — in Lizzo’s case another hit. She kept the audience on their toes making everyone wait till the very end to hear her biggest hit of the year. When she finally gave concertgoers that relief and performed “About Damn Time” it was as if the audience ascended into a new level of happiness while reciting the second verse back to Lizzo word for word.

In the decades to come “it’s bad bitch o’clock” will be considered a legitimate measure of time and popular Instagram photo caption. From appearing on Saturday Night Live twice this year to launching Yitty to premiering an Emmy-winning reality show Lizzo has had a monumental year. The catalyst for it undoubtedly includes (but is not limited to) the dropping of “About Damn Time.” The song spoke to us on varying levels. It packaged everything we’ve been feeling the past couple of years in a disco-esque tune and got us on our feet again."

Departure from Russia

Spain-based restaurant operator AmRest said in a statement on 7 December that it agreed to sell its KFC restaurant business in Russia for at least €100 million to Russian restaurant and entertainment company Almira.

In March AmRest began the process of temporarily suspending the operations of its brands in Russia after a relevant announcement was made by Yum! Brands the owner of the KFC and Pizza Hut brands.

Closure of the deal is subject to approval from the competition authority in Russia Yum! Brands and other approvals by regulatory authorities in Russia. The company stated that the final terms of the transaction are subject to some external factors including the exchange rate.

KFC used to be one of the leading fast-food chains in the Russian market. AmRest operates 215 outlets primarily in the largest Russian cities. In total more than 1000 KFC restaurants operated in the country at the beginning of 2022.

Transition causes pain

Some KFC restaurants in Russia have already changed their banners to a new chain named Rostic’s. However such a step entailed a nearly 20% drop in revenue estimated Sergey Mironov chairman of the coordinating council of the Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers.

He explained that all franchise holders have individual license agreements which means that some restaurants have to change their banners earlier than others. The problem is that the KFC brand has strong recognition among Russian customers and Rostic’s has not.

“It is unclear what franchises should do in this situation. If it converts into Rostic’s it will help the new owner to develop its brand. If it stays as KFC sooner or later it will still have to change it [the name] due to the expiration of the license agreement. My advice: is to switch to their own brands” Mironov said adding that still this situation is “deadly” for the businesses.

Turbulent fast food market landscape

In 2022 the KFC chain will likely experience a rise in revenue in Russia despite huge turbulence in the country’s restaurant industry which is primarily attributed to the withdrawal of Mcdonald’s from the market in the middle of the year the Russian think tank Infoline Analytics said. Like Burger King and other major fast-food chains KFC managed to attract some customers which previously were primarily loyal to Mcdonald’s the analysts assumed.",https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vcmVzdGF1cmFudHMvdGFjby1iZWxsLWp1c3Qta25vY2tlZC1vZmYtYS1tY2RvbmFsZHMtZmFuLWZhdm9yaXRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,Taco Bell Menu Adds New Take on a Beloved McDonald's Item,ERROR: Article `download()` failed with 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://www.thestreet.com/restaurants/taco-bell-just-knocked-off-a-mcdonalds-fan-favorite on URL https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiWWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LnRoZXN0cmVldC5jb20vcmVzdGF1cmFudHMvdGFjby1iZWxsLWp1c3Qta25vY2tlZC1vZmYtYS1tY2RvbmFsZHMtZmFuLWZhdm9yaXRl0gEA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiPWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVhdHRoaXMuY29tL3Jlc3RhdXJhbnQtY2hhaW5zLWV4cGFuZGluZy1iaWctMjAyMy_SAQA?hl=en-US&gl=US&ceid=US%3Aen,8 Restaurant Chains Expanding in 2023,"At the time of this writing in late 2022 there are well over 38000 McDonald's restaurants spread out across more than 100 countries according to the McDonald's Corporation's website. And according to Forbes there are more than 43600 Subway restaurants around the globe. Needless to say these are a couple of very well-established brands; so well-established in fact that there's not that much opportunity for growth and expansion.

But that's hardly the story with the 8 brands we're covering here today; these restaurant chains have big plans for big growth and the expansion is right in the offing. You'll be seeing significant increases in the location counts of these restaurants in 2023. Whether or not the growth continues over coming years into the 30000 and 40000 realm remains to be seen though.

Steakhouse Chain Fogo de Chao Has Grand Plans to Be Everywhere Soon

Charleys Philly Steaks

Chances are good that you have already heard of Charleys Philly Steaks by now as the chain has more than 700 locations spread across 46 states and 17 countries. And the chain added an impressive 100 of said locations in 2022 alone. But that's not good enough for Charleys which plans to add 200 more units in the coming year tipping it ever closer to that 1000-plus count–and it's only a matter of time until that happens.

Taco Bell

At the time of this writing there are around 7000 Taco Bell locations in America and there are only a small number of other countries with more than 100 units. That's not nearly enough in the eyes of executives at Yum! Brands the parent company of Taco Bell. It plans to expand in the US at a moderate but steady rate while overseas the company forecasts the addition of an impressive 1000 locations by the end of 2023.

KFC

KFC is yet another restaurant chain owned by Yum! Brands and like Taco Bell it's one that the parent company wants to grow significantly next year and beyond. Considering KFC already has some 23000 locations worldwide this would be impressive.

Pizza Hut

Pizza Hut is as it happens also owned by Yum! Brands a juggernaut in the restaurant franchise industry. And after years of declining location numbers–the chain had not added new locations in America since 2014–Pizza Hut is a chain that is now set to start expanding aggressively. The Yum! Brands CEO predicts a doubling of location counts ""over time.""

Marco's Pizza

This pizza chain's growth plans are as hot as its ovens. Per a press release the chain put out via PR Newswire Marco's Pizza plans to add about 500 units over the course of 2023 which will mean a system-wide count of about 1500 locations.

Chipotle

If you live in a major metropolitan area it might seem like Chipotle has already reached a saturation point with locations aplenty. But the chain is hardly satisfied with its current domestic footprint and there are plans to add as many as 285 new units in 2023 alone.

Texas Roadhouse

This casual steakhouse is completely serious when it comes to expansion plans. The chain has just over 600 locations at present per Restaurant Business Online but there are plans for growth up to some 900 units in the coming years with 2023 slated to see the additions of many new restaurants.6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e

If they did not have any complaints they were asked for a reminder of their situation after 3 years of bar placement. To ensure this period an additional reminder is placed in the patient’s file for bar removal timing and closely followed by a database analyst.

We have reviewed our prospectively recorded clinical database from 2006 to 2021 and analyzed it retrospectively. There were 1032 patients with a bar removal procedure. Patients’ demographics medical and family history Haller index before placing bar placed bar number body mass index use of stabilizer and wire length of hospital stay time until bar removal incision side and complications overall were analyzed.

Surgical procedure for bar removal

As the time for removal has been decided by either mechanism mentioned above the patient has a standard evaluation for general anesthesia. Routine blood test chest X-ray ECG (electrocardiogram) and additional evaluation regarding the patient’s medical background are ordered. The bar (Zimmer Biomet Inc. Warsaw Indiana USA) removal procedure is performed under general anesthesia using a single-lumen intubation with a standard supine position with both arms opened wide. The patient was placed close to the left side of the surgical table (Photo 1). The surgical incisions used for the previous surgery were located and the left side (or if necessary both sides) was opened (Photo 2). After dissecting subcutaneous tissue and fibrotic soft tissue the pectus bar(s) (Zimmer Biomet Inc. Warsaw Indiana USA) and – if used – fixation tools like a stabilizer and steel wire were identified. After cutting them and removal of the wire(s) with all fragments and the stabilizer(s) the pectus bar was then mobilized bilaterally (Photo 3). Some cases especially those with prolonged bar stay require additional intervention such as using an osteotomy instrument or rongeur to set the bar free from bone and hard fibrotic and calcific healing tissue.

The bar bender (Zimmer Biomet Inc. Warsaw Indiana USA) was used to straighten both ends to allow a safe and smooth removal through the tunnel. Then the bar was carefully moved either direction gently without pulling to be sure there were no remaining strong adhesions or structures blocking the bar from an easy path.

The bar was then pulled out of the tunnel with care to avoid getting stuck or causing injury along the way. After the removal the residue tunnel was inspected to verify that there was no active bleeding which may indicate any mild or massive damage to the intrathoracic structures. After checking that there is no contact with the pleural space if there is any doubt a temporary air evacuation system or a chest tube is placed to remove the free air. After the irrigation with povidone iodine the incisions were closed. It is important to suture subcutaneous planes carefully to avoid any remaining large space (which may cause seroma in early postoperative days) or peri-incisional skin contractions.

After the bar removal procedure as the patient was transferred to the ward a chest X-ray was taken within a hour to see any free air or fluid within the pleural cavity and any other potential clinical situation. High flow nasal oxygen inhalation in case of limited and small amount of pneumothorax or chest tube insertion for larger ones was performed if necessary. If patients were stable they were discharged on the same day and followed up after 2 weeks as an outpatient clinic protocol.",,,,,,,,,,,,
